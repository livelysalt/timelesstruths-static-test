<p>&#8220;Why does Edward get money for doing chores and I don&#8217;t?&#8221; complained Sammy. &#8220;It&#8217;s not fair that he gets to work for Mrs. Wilson. I can work as hard as he can!&#8221;</p>

<p>Grandpa looked up from his book. &#8220;That sounds just like the story I was reading about the children of Israel this morning. Did you ever hear about the time the ground split open?&#8221; Sammy shook his head, so Grandpa began.</p>

<blockquote>
<h1>Just as Good as Moses</h1>

<p class="noindent">(From <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Numbers+16">Numbers 16</a>)</p>

<p>Everyone in the Israelite camp had jobs. Some hauled water and others took care of the animals. The Levites had the special job of serving in the Lord&#8217;s tabernacle. But only the family of Aaron, Moses&#8217; brother, were allowed to be priests.</p>

<p>Korah was a Levite, and he didn&#8217;t think it was fair. &#8220;Why does Moses have to be in charge? I think that we are just as good as he is,&#8221; Korah said to his friend, Dathan. &#8220;Moses and Aaron just like to act better than the rest of us,&#8221; Dathan agreed. Soon the two men had gathered together all the smartest and most popular princes in the camp.</p>

<p>When Moses heard what the revolters had to say, he was upset. &#8220;Tomorrow you will see who God is pleased with,&#8221; he told them sorrowfully. &#8220;You must all bring incense before the Lord and we will see who the Lord will choose. Sons of Levi, why do you complain about the work that the Lord has given you?&#8221; But Korah and his followers would not listen to their leader&#8217;s words. The more Moses talked, the more stubborn they became.</p>

<p>The next morning Korah, Dathan, and all the princes stood with their censers of incense before the tabernacle. Then Moses stepped forward and called out to the people, &#8220;Depart from the tents of these wicked men, or else you will be consumed in all their sins!&#8221; The crowds fell back as Korah and Dathan stood in the doorway of their tents with their families.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you will know that it was the Lord who sent me to be your leader,&#8221; Moses said. &#8220;If the Lord makes the earth to open up and swallow these men and all they have, then you will know that they have provoked the Lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment there was a great rumble and the ground beneath Korah and Dathan&#8217;s tents cracked open and screams pierced the air as they disappeared from sight. In panic the people scattered in every direction. But the princes, holding the burning incense, did not escape. For their rebellion the Lord sent a fire to consume them where they stood.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Sammy&#8217;s eyes opened wide as Grandpa finished the story. &#8220;Did they get all burnt up?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The princes did,&#8221; said Grandpa solemnly. &#8220;And Korah and Dathan got buried in the ground. Why do you think God did that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because they were being bad and wanting their own way,&#8221; Sammy said, looking down.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose that you would have joined them?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sammy shook his head.</p>

<p>Grandpa stood up and put on his coat. &#8220;How about being Grandpa&#8217;s helper today? I need a strong boy like you to help me get firewood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; said Sammy, running to get his boots. &#8220;I like watching you split the big logs, Grandpa!&#8221;</p>

<p>Grandpa laughed. &#8220;You can learn how to crack logs, too. We&#8217;ll bury all the Korahs and Dathans with God&#8217;s help, won&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; asked Sammy.</p>

<p>&#8220;By some hard work. I&#8217;ll show you,&#8221; said Grandpa with a wink. And he did.</p>
