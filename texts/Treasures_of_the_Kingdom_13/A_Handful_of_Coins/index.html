<h1>A Handful of Coins</h1>

<h2 class="subtitle">A True Story</h2>
<p>&#8220;Ready girls?&#8221; Daddy called from the driver&#8217;s seat. &#8220;We&#8217;d better hurry.&#8221; Krista climbed into the car next to her younger sister, clutching her traveling bag excitedly. Dad and Mom were going away for several weeks, and the Webb family had said she and Alison could stay with them. In all her nine years she couldn&#8217;t remember being away from home so long.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bye! See you later!&#8221; she called to Mom and her two littlest sisters. But butterflies were flipping in her stomach as they parked in front of the Webb&#8217;s two-story house a few minutes later. Clare and Philip Webb were school friends, but she had never stayed overnight at their house before.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_13/coins_tag.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="247" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Bring your bags right in, girls, and Clare will show you your beds,&#8221; Mrs. Webb was saying. Her kind voice and smile made them feel right at home. Krista was soon joining the others in a game in the yard, and the nervousness was forgotten in squeals of laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m it!&#8221; Philip yelled, and the girls scattered. In among the tall blueberry bushes they crouched and dodged until Alison was caught. Then the chase began all over again. Krista was panting and glad for a rest when Mrs. Webb called them inside for supper.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to be having fun,&#8221; she said pleasantly as they sat down around the dining room table. Everyone grew quiet, and Krista felt her shyness return as Mr. Webb bowed his head. At home everyone held hands and recited the blessing together, but she followed the others&#8217; example and clasped her hands in front of her. Bowing her head, she suddenly felt very homesick for the prattle of her little sisters and the familiar faces of her big brothers and parents.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_13/coins_prayer.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="172" /></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8203;and we thank You for all Your blessings. Amen,&#8221; Mr. Webb was saying then. There was a clatter of utensils as Mrs. Webb began to serve out the food. Krista was glad to see her pile her plate with rice and chicken, for suddenly she realized how hungry she was. With a full stomach her happy spirits returned, and she cheerfully helped Clare clear the table. It wasn&#8217;t until bedtime that Krista thought of home again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your toothbrush,&#8221; Krista said to Alison, &#8220;and here&#8217;s mine.&#8221; At the sink Clare offered to share her toothpaste tube with them. Krista and Clare smiled at each other as they made foamy circles in their mouths. Suddenly Krista thought of something.</p>

<p>&#8220;Washa,&#8221; she tried to speak, then swallowed. &#8220;What time do you go to bed?&#8221; Clare looked at her with surprise and spit into the sink.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_13/coins_toothbrush.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="172" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Did you swallow your toothpaste?&#8221; she asked in a shocked voice. Krista nodded mutely, wondering what was wrong. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you know you&#8217;re suppose to spit it out? It&#8217;s yucky to swallow it!&#8221; Krista looked at her friend in surprise. She had never thought of that before! How many other new and strange things would she learn here, she wondered?</p>

<p>In the following days Krista soon grew accustomed to the differences of the Webb family and began to feel more at home. The Webbs always included the girls like they were one of the family, and Mrs. Webb&#8217;s kindness soon won their hearts. Philip and Clare were also glad to have them join in their chores as well as the after-school frolics. So in most ways the week went by pleasantly for Krista.</p>

<p>Sunday morning came with a bustle of preparation in getting ready for church. &#8220;Girls, as soon as you&#8217;re dressed, come down so I can help you with your hair,&#8221; Mrs. Webb called from the bottom of the stairs. &#8220;Remember to make your beds and brush your teeth.&#8221;</p>

<p>When, at last, they were ready to leave, Krista watched Mr. Webb open his change-purse and scooped out a handful of coins. Before church every Sunday her father usually gave them each one piece of money for the offering, so it was with great surprise she saw Mr. Webb pour a whole pile into Philip&#8217;s open hand. When a similar handful was given to her, Krista couldn&#8217;t help but look at it with wonder. She had never had so much money in her whole life!</p>

<p>Carefully Krista put the treasure into her dress pocket for safe-keeping, but she couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about it. All the way to church she sat quietly fingering those coins. She remembered the sweets and chewing gum that other children bought at the little store nearby, but which she never had money for. How very much she wanted to buy some for herself! She knew the money was not hers, but it would be so nice if it were. Maybe there was some way that she could keep it. She sat through the Sunday service thinking about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, miss.&#8221; The collection bag was being passed to her now, and as Krista took it, it seemed so easy to follow through with her plan. She just wouldn&#8217;t put any money in. A flush of pink came to her cheeks as she passed the bag on to Clare, but her friend didn&#8217;t seem to notice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clink-clankety-clank,&#8221; went her handful, and then Alison&#8217;s. Krista thought again of the delicious treats she would buy, and she was glad she had kept the coins in her pocket. Soon the children were called away to their Sunday School classes, and by the time the services closed Krista had forgotten all about her pocket full of coins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s play Double Solitare,&#8221; suggested Clare, while they waited for lunch to be prepared. With criss-crossed legs they made a circle on the living room floor and the four of them were soon caught up in the excitement of the game.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won!&#8221; Alison said triumphantly, slapping down the last match. Krista scooted back from the circle, and glancing up, was surprised to see Mrs. Webb looking down at her quizzically.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_13/coins_spilled.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="288" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Krista, dear, how is it that you didn&#8217;t put the money in the offering this morning?&#8221; she asked quietly. Heart-thumping, Krista looked down to see that her stolen treasure had all spilled out onto the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8212;I couldn&#8217;t find it when the collection bag came,&#8221; she said, keeping her eyes on those terrible coins. Outside she spoke calmly, but inside she was all a-tremble. What, oh what, would happen now?</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; Mrs. Webb said sweetly, kneeling down beside her, &#8220;I&#8217;ll just take them to save for next time.&#8221; With that she gathered up the money and left, without saying anything more.</p>

<p>Krista sat very still, feelings of gladness and shame mixed all topsy-turvy inside. The others hadn&#8217;t seemed to have noticed anything at all, and for this she was very glad. But oh, how terrible it was to be found out! Never again did she want to take anything that wasn&#8217;t her own.</p>

<p>In her sensitive heart, the gentle dealings of kind Mrs. Webb made their lasting impression. It wasn&#8217;t until nearly two years later that Krista saw her need of God and the clean heart He could give her. When she responded to His loving call, she realized how good the Lord had been to keep her from becoming the thief she might have been.</p>
