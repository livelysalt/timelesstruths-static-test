<h1>Treasure in the Prickly Patch</h1>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_13/prickly_weed.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="121" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Can I help?&#8221; Rosie asked, the minute she hopped out of the van.</p>

<p>Aunt Jenny laughed as she stepped from the porch to meet them. &#8220;You surely can, for there&#8217;s plenty to do.&#8221; Rosie looked eagerly across the dry lawn to the old buildings where she could see the boys working. The place Uncle Albert had bought looked more exciting than she had imagined, complete with an old tower behind the barn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mama,&#8221; Cousin Amy said, coming around the corner, &#8220;can Rosie help us in the garden? There&#8217;s lots and lots of weeds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be just the thing,&#8221; Aunt Jenny agreed, and the two girls hurried off.</p>

<p>Rosie&#8217;s eagerness faded when she caught sight of the large weed patch in the middle of the back yard. It looked more like prickles than anything else, but she remembered her morning prayer asking Jesus to help her be a willing worker. She would do her best.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_13/prickly_weeding.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Look what I found!&#8221; Megan called excitedly, pulling a fuzzy-leafed plant from among the weeds. &#8220;It has a red root!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know what it is,&#8221; Rosie said, as they joined Megan in the garden. &#8220;It&#8217;s a radish: we grow them at home. It&#8217;s kind of spicy, but I like it with dip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow, I didn&#8217;t know there were vegetables in here.&#8221; Amy pulled up a dandelion, looking at the ground closely. &#8220;Is that another one?&#8221; With eager hands the girls soon uncovered a whole row of radishes among the prickly weeds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s call them our treasures,&#8221; Megan suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is going to be fun,&#8221; agreed Rosie. &#8220;Let&#8217;s work really hard and surprise our moms.&#8221; Her fingers were soon pricked and dirty, and her back felt stiff from bending, but Rosie was enjoying herself. Now she was glad she was pulling those weeds, for there were hidden treasures to find.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure thirsty, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; Amy said, after they had worked for over an hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;And hot.&#8221; Rosie wiped her sweaty face on her sleeve. &#8220;I wish we could have a sprinkler on!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we have lemonade?&#8221; asked Megan, throwing another handful of weeds on the fast-growing pile. Amy ran off to the house to find out, and the girls stopped to rest. Rosie stretched and looked around.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that tall tower yours, Megan?&#8221; she asked. They could see it plainly in the shady trees behind the barn, with its crumbling walls and dark window. It looked like a little castle from a storybook.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but Dad says we shouldn&#8217;t go in it,&#8221; Megan said. &#8220;I asked him this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then Amy came puffing up to them. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got some cold lemonade that they&#8217;re bringing for everybody,&#8221; she said. Aunt Jenny and the older girls came and everyone gathered in the shade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Been doing any work?&#8221; Irene teased as she passed out the cups.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been working really hard,&#8221; Megan said, trying to wipe some of the dirt off her fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ve found lots of treasures,&#8221; added Rosie.</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind?&#8221; asked Cousin Ronald, as he waited for Aunt Jenny to fill his glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Radishes and potatoes.&#8221; Rosie pointed at the rows they had uncovered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, those really are treasures,&#8221; Aunt Jenny said, admiring their work.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been finding a mine of great stuff, too,&#8221; Ronald said. He pulled a tin box out of his pocket that held a pile of old coins and a few rusty keys. Chad had even found a pocket knife.</p>

<p>Daniel stepped nearer to Rosie and whispered, &#8220;Ron says there might even be a treasure chest in the old tower, &#8217;cause it was used by smugglers a long time ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; Rosie was about to ask, but Aunt Jenny was talking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well children, treasures or no we must all get back to work.&#8221; She started toward the house. &#8220;The garden is looking wonderful, girls&#8212;keep up the good work.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_13/prickly_tower.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="353" /></div>
<p>The next hour dragged slowly as the girls worked in the heat of the sun. Rosie tried to keep cheerful thinking how happy Aunt Jenny would be, but the weeds seemed extra stubborn and prickly. <i>If only we could work in the shade like the boys are,</i> she complained to herself. <i>If only we could explore that old tower.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe we can go in the sprinkler for awhile,&#8221; Amy said at last, looking at the rows still to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go ask,&#8221; Rosie said quickly. She ran over the prickly grass and stepped onto the cool, shaded porch. Uncle Albert sat on a chair taking off his shoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good time for a break,&#8221; he said, when she asked about the sprinkler. &#8220;There might be some hoses behind the barn. But don&#8217;t go near the old tower; it&#8217;s not safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; she called as she slipped out the gate. But, as she waded through the tall grass, Rosie couldn&#8217;t help wondering, <i>Why can&#8217;t I take just one peak?</i> It stood before her now, tall and mysterious. What could be so dangerous about it? Broken bricks lay piled in the grass near the window, and as Rosie stepped closer she felt a cool breeze brush her face. What treasure was hidden behind those dark walls?</p>

<p>&#8220;Ouch!&#8221; Rosie stepped back quickly and looked at the prickly vine she had stepped on. <i>What was it about thorns that Dad had said that morning in devotions?</i> &#8220;If we don&#8217;t conquer our enemies by God&#8217;s help, they would become like the weed.&#8221; She had been pulling those all morning.</p>

<p>Rosie looked up at the old tower and prayed, &#8220;Dear Lord Jesus, help me to do right&#8212;and not let the prickly weeds grow.&#8221; Turning around quickly, Rosie began walking back the way she came. &#8220;I <i>will</i> conquer and obey,&#8221; she said to herself.</p>

<p>As she turned the corner of the barn Rosie spotted something green lying coiled in the grass. Bending down she uncovered a hose, and a yellow sprinkler nearby. Rosie picked them up, and a smile lit her face. <i>This is the best treasure yet,</i> she thought, <i>and Jesus helped me find it.</i></p>

<p>Megan and Amy were waiting in the shade when Rosie came back, hauling her prize with her. &#8220;We can turn it on in the garden while we finish pulling weeds,&#8221; she said, and laughed. &#8220;I surely want to pull every prickly one up!&#8221;</p>

<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_13/Dont_Listen/index.html">Don&#8217;t Listen!</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Don&#8217;t Listen!</h1>

<p>In the story Rosie was tempted to do what she knew was wrong. That was the devil whispering to her, and whenever we hear that voice we must stop listening at once! If you listen to the devil, it will be harder and harder to do what is right.</p>

<p>What sort of things does the devil try to tell us? He wants us to disobey, to hit back, and to pout for our own way. Haven&#8217;t you heard him say, &#8220;If you pretend you didn&#8217;t hear Mom, then you won&#8217;t have to obey her&#8221;? As soon as we start listening to the devil, the wrong things will sound better and better to us. The devil will persuade us that it is not <i>that bad</i> to take one candy or to read one bad book. Don&#8217;t listen!</p>

<p>The devil makes his words sound good and &#8220;tempting&#8221; to us. When you feel tired the devil will say, &#8220;Lie on the couch and let the others do the work.&#8221; How do you know that the devil is talking? Think about what Jesus would want you to do. The devil tells us to do things that aren&#8217;t right. But God&#8217;s way is always good and right, and He will help us to do the right thing if we ask Him.</p>

<p>When a temptation comes you have a choice. You can listen to that &#8220;weed thought,&#8221; or you can ask Jesus to help you pull it out. Rosie&#8217;s temptation started when she began wishing to go to the tower, even though she knew she shouldn&#8217;t. When she listened to the devil, he got her to go closer and closer. What if Rosie had asked God to help her be happy and obey when the thought first came? I think she would have more treasures, because when we are willing and obedient, God gives us His best. Look at the promises in God&#8217;s Word, like in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalms+34%3A8-9">Psalms 34:8-9</a>.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_13/The_Tranquil_Dove_Peace/index.html">The Tranquil Dove: Peace</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<p>Hear that cooing from that fence rail? Come let&#8217;s go see what we can learn today from another little bird&#8212;</p>

<h1>The Tranquil Dove: Peace</h1>

<p>She sits and looks at us with soft eyes, plainly saying she wouldn&#8217;t want to hurt anyone. Let us sit and watch her for awhile.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_13/peace_doves.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="209" /></div>
<p>Why do we think of peace when we look at a dove? A black bird hops near and we see that she makes room for him. The dove gets along very well with other birds. Just look! Several more doves are coming and they all fly down to eat together. Doves like to eat in flocks, even with other kinds of birds, because it makes them feel safe. They don&#8217;t want to disturb others or be disturbed. That is called being <i>tranquil</i>.</p>

<p>After the dove has eaten, she flies away over to a quiet roosting place. She won&#8217;t rush about during the day like other birds, but likes to rest and sit calmly. The dove is peaceful because it is not hurrying or fretting about what can not be done. She is at harmony with God and the world He made, so she is not easily disturbed. Don&#8217;t we have much to learn from our tranquil friend?</p>

<p>The Bible says to let the peace of God rule in our hearts. How can we do that? We can play nicely and share with others, just like the doves. When God has given us something good, don&#8217;t we want to share it with others? We are peaceful when we don&#8217;t bother or disturb others. When we are pouting and whining for our own way we are not at peace, are we?</p>

<p>Jesus gives us peacefulness inside when we trust and obey Him. We don&#8217;t have to go rushing about trying to make everyone do what we want. We can rest because He is in control, and that makes us <i>in harmony</i> with what He is doing. If you don&#8217;t get the toy you want, just thank God that He knows best. If some trouble comes along, just tell Jesus about it. He is the One that makes us feel safe and secure.</p>

<h2>Five Little Pebbles</h2>
<p>S. J. B. Carter</p>

<p class="verse">Five little pebbles lay in a brook,<br />Five little pebbles hid in a nook.<br />&#8220;What are we good for?&#8221; one said to the other.<br />&#8220;Little or nothing, I&#8217;m thinking, my brother.&#8221;<br />Wearing away, day after day,<br />It seemed that forever those pebbles might stay.</p>

<p class="verse">If they were flowers, ever so gay,<br />Doubtless someone would take them away;<br />Or if they were big stones that builders could use,<br />Perhaps then some builder those stones would choose.</p>

<p class="verse">Wait, little pebbles, rounded and clean,<br />Long in your loneliness, lying unseen;<br />God has a future a-waiting for you,<br />Five little pebbles, sturdy and true.</p>

<p class="verse">Five little pebbles hid in a brook,<br />David came down and gave then a look,<br />Picked them up carefully out of the sand;<br />Five little pebbles great in his hand.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Hark&#8221;; there is shouting, there&#8217;s fighting today,<br />Boldly these pebbles are borne to the fray;<br />One of them chosen and put in a sling&#8212;<br />Could we have thought that a stone could thus wing?</p>

<p class="verse">Onward it sped, with a might not its own,<br />Onward it sped, by the shepherd boy thrown;<br />Swift as an arrow, straight as a dart,<br />For the whole nation that stone played its part.<br />Striking the giant&#8217;s great terrible head,<br />Laying him low&#8212;a mighty man dead.</p>

<p class="verse">Five little pebbles lay in a brook,<br />Mentioned with honor in God&#8217;s Holy Book.<br />Be thou a pebble, contented and low,<br />Ever kept clean by His mercy&#8217;s pure flow,<br />Hidden and ready till Jesus shall look,<br />And choose you, and use you&#8212;a stone from the brook.</p>

<p>&#8220;See what I wrote, Grandpa?&#8221; Edward held up a blue card with red letters on it.</p>

<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;I love you Dad&#8212;You&#8217;re the Best!&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221; Grandpa&#8217;s eyes twinkled. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that before; but there are other times we dads aren&#8217;t liked so much. Let me tell you a story about</p>

<h1>A Father&#8217;s Love</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+15%3A11-24">Luke 15:11-24</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">There was once a boy, whom we will call Zack, the son of a hard-working farmer. But Zack didn&#8217;t always think he had a good father. &#8220;Ben has his own cart and goes where he wants,&#8221; he complained to his older brother. &#8220;Father&#8217;s an old miser to keep us here and make us work. When I&#8217;m big, I&#8217;m going to leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Zack would grumble and get out of as much work as he could. &#8220;I want money to go to the city,&#8221; he begged his father. Father was always kind, but firm. &#8220;Son, I want the best for you. Running off won&#8217;t help anything.&#8221; But Zack never quit thinking about the great day when he could leave home.</p>

<p>The day came when Zack was given his share of the living. It was Father&#8217;s savings from years of hard work, but Zack didn&#8217;t care. It was his now; and he was off to fulfill his dreams, leaving a sad-faced father far behind. There were parties and sleepovers, friends, and all the desserts he wanted. Zack said in delight, &#8220;At last I am free from Father&#8217;s watchful eye and can enjoy myself!&#8221;</p>

<p>But riches soon flee, and there came a day Zack spent his last penny. Now he had nowhere to get bread or shelter, for his friends lasted only as long as his money. Zack could do nothing but search for a job. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry son,&#8221; he heard over and over, &#8220;times are bad and we need good workers. I can&#8217;t hire you.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was when Zack was near despair that a swine-herder offered him work. He had been taught all his life to despise pigs, but he took the position as his last hope. Alone and miserable, Zack looked with disgust at the snorting greedy herd as he fed them their husks. He looked at himself: now a ragged, starving boy far, far from home. &#8220;Why am I here?&#8221; he asked himself. &#8220;Surely working as my father&#8217;s hired hand would be better than this!&#8221;</p>

<p>So it was a dirty dejected boy who tramped home at last. Zack hoped his father would at least give him a chance to work in the fields. But who was that man running to meet him? Father&#8217;s arms were stretched wide and tears were trickling down his cheeks. &#8220;Oh, Father,&#8221; Zack said, burying his face in a strong shoulder, &#8220;I have done wrong to you! I am not fit to be called your son.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no reply from the kind loving man that held him close. Shouting was filling the air now, and over his bowed head Zack heard Father call, &#8220;Make ready a feast and bring the best robe. My son who was dead is alive again&#8212;the son who was lost is now found!&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>


<p>&#8220;I think I see what you mean,&#8221; Edward said slowly, when Grandpa had finished. &#8220;It didn&#8217;t seem like his dad loved him, but he really did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He loved him because he wanted what was best for him,&#8221; said Alice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that is the true kind of love,&#8221; agreed Grandpa. &#8220;But it is the hardest love to show to people sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Sammy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, think about how your father has to discipline you when you are naughty. He does it because he loves you and wants you to live right, but it is not easy to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t feel good either,&#8221; said Sammy.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if we didn&#8217;t get punished, we might get in big trouble and go to jail or something,&#8221; said Edward. &#8220;I love my dad, even if he does have to punish me sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing, too,&#8221; Alice began, then she added more slowly, &#8220;but I guess we all need correction and to be taught to do the right thing. I guess fathers are important people and they have a big job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We call God our Father, too,&#8221; said Sammy. &#8220;Does He love us with a hard love?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, He surely does,&#8221; Grandpa said. &#8220;He loves us so much that He doesn&#8217;t want us to do anything wrong. It is sin and wickedness that makes people&#8217;s lives sad and miserable. God corrects us and deals with our hearts so that we will live right. Everything He does, even when it seems like a bad thing, He does because He loves us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God does everything right, so I think He is the best Father of all,&#8221; said Edward.</p>

<h1>A Handful of Coins</h1>

<h2 class="subtitle">A True Story</h2>
<p>&#8220;Ready girls?&#8221; Daddy called from the driver&#8217;s seat. &#8220;We&#8217;d better hurry.&#8221; Krista climbed into the car next to her younger sister, clutching her traveling bag excitedly. Dad and Mom were going away for several weeks, and the Webb family had said she and Alison could stay with them. In all her nine years she couldn&#8217;t remember being away from home so long.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bye! See you later!&#8221; she called to Mom and her two littlest sisters. But butterflies were flipping in her stomach as they parked in front of the Webb&#8217;s two-story house a few minutes later. Clare and Philip Webb were school friends, but she had never stayed overnight at their house before.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_13/coins_tag.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="247" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Bring your bags right in, girls, and Clare will show you your beds,&#8221; Mrs. Webb was saying. Her kind voice and smile made them feel right at home. Krista was soon joining the others in a game in the yard, and the nervousness was forgotten in squeals of laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m it!&#8221; Philip yelled, and the girls scattered. In among the tall blueberry bushes they crouched and dodged until Alison was caught. Then the chase began all over again. Krista was panting and glad for a rest when Mrs. Webb called them inside for supper.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to be having fun,&#8221; she said pleasantly as they sat down around the dining room table. Everyone grew quiet, and Krista felt her shyness return as Mr. Webb bowed his head. At home everyone held hands and recited the blessing together, but she followed the others&#8217; example and clasped her hands in front of her. Bowing her head, she suddenly felt very homesick for the prattle of her little sisters and the familiar faces of her big brothers and parents.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_13/coins_prayer.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="172" /></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8203;and we thank You for all Your blessings. Amen,&#8221; Mr. Webb was saying then. There was a clatter of utensils as Mrs. Webb began to serve out the food. Krista was glad to see her pile her plate with rice and chicken, for suddenly she realized how hungry she was. With a full stomach her happy spirits returned, and she cheerfully helped Clare clear the table. It wasn&#8217;t until bedtime that Krista thought of home again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your toothbrush,&#8221; Krista said to Alison, &#8220;and here&#8217;s mine.&#8221; At the sink Clare offered to share her toothpaste tube with them. Krista and Clare smiled at each other as they made foamy circles in their mouths. Suddenly Krista thought of something.</p>

<p>&#8220;Washa,&#8221; she tried to speak, then swallowed. &#8220;What time do you go to bed?&#8221; Clare looked at her with surprise and spit into the sink.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_13/coins_toothbrush.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="172" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Did you swallow your toothpaste?&#8221; she asked in a shocked voice. Krista nodded mutely, wondering what was wrong. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you know you&#8217;re suppose to spit it out? It&#8217;s yucky to swallow it!&#8221; Krista looked at her friend in surprise. She had never thought of that before! How many other new and strange things would she learn here, she wondered?</p>

<p>In the following days Krista soon grew accustomed to the differences of the Webb family and began to feel more at home. The Webbs always included the girls like they were one of the family, and Mrs. Webb&#8217;s kindness soon won their hearts. Philip and Clare were also glad to have them join in their chores as well as the after-school frolics. So in most ways the week went by pleasantly for Krista.</p>

<p>Sunday morning came with a bustle of preparation in getting ready for church. &#8220;Girls, as soon as you&#8217;re dressed, come down so I can help you with your hair,&#8221; Mrs. Webb called from the bottom of the stairs. &#8220;Remember to make your beds and brush your teeth.&#8221;</p>

<p>When, at last, they were ready to leave, Krista watched Mr. Webb open his change-purse and scooped out a handful of coins. Before church every Sunday her father usually gave them each one piece of money for the offering, so it was with great surprise she saw Mr. Webb pour a whole pile into Philip&#8217;s open hand. When a similar handful was given to her, Krista couldn&#8217;t help but look at it with wonder. She had never had so much money in her whole life!</p>

<p>Carefully Krista put the treasure into her dress pocket for safe-keeping, but she couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about it. All the way to church she sat quietly fingering those coins. She remembered the sweets and chewing gum that other children bought at the little store nearby, but which she never had money for. How very much she wanted to buy some for herself! She knew the money was not hers, but it would be so nice if it were. Maybe there was some way that she could keep it. She sat through the Sunday service thinking about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, miss.&#8221; The collection bag was being passed to her now, and as Krista took it, it seemed so easy to follow through with her plan. She just wouldn&#8217;t put any money in. A flush of pink came to her cheeks as she passed the bag on to Clare, but her friend didn&#8217;t seem to notice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clink-clankety-clank,&#8221; went her handful, and then Alison&#8217;s. Krista thought again of the delicious treats she would buy, and she was glad she had kept the coins in her pocket. Soon the children were called away to their Sunday School classes, and by the time the services closed Krista had forgotten all about her pocket full of coins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s play Double Solitare,&#8221; suggested Clare, while they waited for lunch to be prepared. With criss-crossed legs they made a circle on the living room floor and the four of them were soon caught up in the excitement of the game.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won!&#8221; Alison said triumphantly, slapping down the last match. Krista scooted back from the circle, and glancing up, was surprised to see Mrs. Webb looking down at her quizzically.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_13/coins_spilled.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="288" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Krista, dear, how is it that you didn&#8217;t put the money in the offering this morning?&#8221; she asked quietly. Heart-thumping, Krista looked down to see that her stolen treasure had all spilled out onto the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8212;I couldn&#8217;t find it when the collection bag came,&#8221; she said, keeping her eyes on those terrible coins. Outside she spoke calmly, but inside she was all a-tremble. What, oh what, would happen now?</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; Mrs. Webb said sweetly, kneeling down beside her, &#8220;I&#8217;ll just take them to save for next time.&#8221; With that she gathered up the money and left, without saying anything more.</p>

<p>Krista sat very still, feelings of gladness and shame mixed all topsy-turvy inside. The others hadn&#8217;t seemed to have noticed anything at all, and for this she was very glad. But oh, how terrible it was to be found out! Never again did she want to take anything that wasn&#8217;t her own.</p>

<p>In her sensitive heart, the gentle dealings of kind Mrs. Webb made their lasting impression. It wasn&#8217;t until nearly two years later that Krista saw her need of God and the clean heart He could give her. When she responded to His loving call, she realized how good the Lord had been to keep her from becoming the thief she might have been.</p>

<h2>Something You Can Do</h2>
<p>After reading about &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_13/The_Tranquil_Dove/index.html">The Tranquil Dove</a>,&#8221; can you tell me what doves do in the middle of the day? After they have eaten with the other birds, they go to a quiet place to rest, don&#8217;t they? You can always keep busy doing, doing, doing, but then you will miss out on the special secrets of</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_13/something_place_a.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="194" /></div>
<h1>The Peaceful Place</h1>

<p>It is something you can make in your very own home. It will be your special hideout to be all by yourself for awhile, especially when Mom needs a rest. So&#8230;.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_13/something_place_b.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="102" /></div>
<p>First think very carefully about WHERE it will be. Is there a little cubbyhole under the stairs, or a closet that is not too full? Maybe there is a corner behind Daddy&#8217;s chair that you can use, or a hidden spot out in the yard or shed. It needs to be big enough for you to sit down comfortably, and hidden enough so you won&#8217;t be bothered.</p>

<p>After you have found it, think of how to make it COMFORTABLE. Ask Mom if you can use a small pillow or stool to sit on. Your Peaceful Place can be cozy for curling up, or it can have a little bench to write on and do quiet projects. Add a little box for treasures and a stuffed animal or doll if you like. Make your Peaceful Place to be your favorite hideout.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_13/something_place_c.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="167" /></div>
<p>WHAT will you do in your Peaceful Place? Something peaceful, of course! Think of things that don&#8217;t make a mess, but that will be pleasant and quiet. Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>On a poster board you can carefully write a poem or Bible verse. Around it draw flowers and vines, or glue pretty pictures from a magazine. After you have made it beautiful, give it to someone or put it on your own wall. Remember to keep your place tidy!</li>

<li>Write &#8220;I love you&#8221; notes to everyone in your family. Tell them &#8220;thank you&#8221; for things they do and think of things to make them smile. If you can&#8217;t write well, draw pictures and then put them all around the table at suppertime.</li>

<li>If you like to read, tuck away a good story (the kind you wouldn&#8217;t mind showing to Jesus) for your peaceful time. Or, maybe you can listen to songs or story cassette tapes quietly.</li>

</ul>
<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_13/something_place_d.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="170" /></div>
<p>YOUR PEACEFUL PLACE is a very special spot where you can pray and tell all your troubles and joys to Jesus. You can take a songbook and your own little Bible, if you have one, and have your own little talk with Jesus. Do you know He wants to be close to us all the time? If you let Him in, He will make your hideout the most peaceful place in the world!</p>

<h1>On Your Guard</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Want-to-Fight,</p>

<p>No soldier can fight without his head protected. Look around and you can see that helmets are important. Why does the construction worker, the fireman, and the motorcycle rider have to wear one? To protect their head of course!</p>

<p>Your head is where you think and know things&#8212;and when your head is smashed, you&#8217;re dead! Did you notice Rosie&#8217;s &#8220;helmet&#8221; in the story? I gave it to her when she joined My army to fight against wrong. It is called the Helmet of Salvation and protects you from the devil. He is trying to make you do wrong to destroy you, but if you have Salvation, Jesus will help you to always do right.</p>

<p>This Helmet is given to every soldier, and I make it especially to fit. If you have enemies that whisper dirty thoughts, I have special ear-guards for you. If the devil likes to pound you on the head with Anger, I have a double-plate of Love to protect you. Don&#8217;t go another day without it; you need this helmet to stay alive.</p>

<p>How can you get this helmet? You must stop wearing &#8220;My Way&#8221; and &#8220;Me First&#8221; and all other fancy hats, because Salvation won&#8217;t fit with them on. When you throw away everything that is wrong, and come and ask Me, I will hear. I am making a helmet just for you; come, bow your head to receive it.</p>

<p>Do you like to make up stories and imagine &#8220;what would happen if&#8230;&#8203;?&#8221; Stories help us to think about our lives and the choices we make. It is the bad people that will get punished, and the good ones that get rewarded. What would happen in the story of Rosie &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_13/Treasure_in_the_Prickly_Patch/index.html">At the Palace Gates</a>&#8221; if&#8230;&#8203;</p>

<p>Imagine if you were Rosie or Daniel, and think what you&#8217;d do. Will your story tell about why the tower wasn&#8217;t safe, or how the girls finished their weeding? Make up your own ending and see what other &#8220;treasures&#8221; you could add to it!</p>

<h1>Billy and the Beanstalk</h1>

<p>&#8220;All right, Billy,&#8221; Mother said. &#8220;You can spend the evening with Dan.&#8221; She looked very serious. &#8220;But, Billy, you know that Dan&#8217;s parents are not living for the Lord.&#8221; She looked quietly at her little boy. &#8220;What will you do if Dan wants to watch television or movies?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy looked at Mother. &#8220;I won&#8217;t watch them,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;I&#8217;ll call you to come get me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dan had a big backyard, and the boys played with his rabbits until supper. &#8220;Let&#8217;s watch TV!&#8221; said Dan after they ate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have your mother read us a book,&#8221; Billy said quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Okay!&#8221; Dan shouted. &#8220;Mom! Could you read to us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Dan&#8217;s mom; and she was a good reader. Billy had never heard the story before, and she read so that you could almost see things happening!</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_13/beanstalk_tales.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="369" /></div>
<p>The story was about a very smart boy named Jack. At first, he didn&#8217;t seem so smart, because he traded his mother&#8217;s cow for a <i>bean</i>! Dan&#8217;s mom made lonesome mooing noises as the cow was taken away. Then she made the mother shout at Jack in such a loud, angry voice that Billy jumped and was almost scared. Jack&#8217;s mother must not be saved, Billy thought. Nobody could live for the Lord and act like that!</p>

<p>But Dan was laughing. &#8220;Boy, his mother was dumb!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just wait!&#8221; Billy didn&#8217;t like that either. He kept thinking how his mother didn&#8217;t act like that, because she was living for Jesus. If she were disappointed in what he did, she would pray with him and ask Jesus to help him do right. Besides, the Bible said to honor your father and mother.</p>

<p>Then, in the story, the bean began to grow. Jack planted it in the ground, and in one night, it grew up, up, up&#8230;. Dan&#8217;s mom climbed on top of the chair, then the table, and she slapped her hand on the ceiling to show how the bean kept growing. Dan&#8217;s daddy came in and he laughed very hard.</p>

<p>Billy remembered how long he had to wait for beans to come up in the garden. This was ridiculous! Then, in the story, Jack began to climb up this bean plant&#8212;up beyond the clouds to where a giant lived in a palace! This giant had all sorts of amazing, strange things. He said horrible things, too. And then the boy, Jack, began to <i>steal</i> things from the giant.</p>

<p>Billy had been feeling more and more disgusted, but when the boy in the story began to steal things, Billy jumped up. &#8220;That&#8217;s stealing!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;that&#8217;s wrong!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dan stared at Billy. His mom stared at Billy, and even his daddy looked surprised.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_13/beanstalk_bible.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="153" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know stealing is wrong?&#8221; Billy said. &#8220;God won&#8217;t be happy with Jack, unless he takes everything back to the giant and tells him that he&#8217;s sorry!&#8221; Billy looked around and saw that they were all looking at the floor. Finally, Dan&#8217;s mom shrugged and shut the book.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Billy was right, wasn&#8217;t he? Stealing is wrong, whether it happens in a story or for real. Wrong is wrong, and right is right. And Billy wanted to do what was right all of the time, whether he was at home or not at home.</p>

<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_13/letter_argue.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="186" /></div>
<p class="noindent">Dear Princess,</p>

<p>It was a sunny day and Princess Precious was home with her brother and sister, with an older princess, called Encouragement, to watch them. This was not much to Precious&#8217; liking, for she had wanted to go with the other big girls on an outing. And for some reason Valiant was being a bother, as brothers sometimes are, so the two weren&#8217;t getting along very well.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to my room,&#8221; Precious said, after he pulled her braid twice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who cares?&#8221; said Valiant. He turned his back and began whistling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop it!&#8221; Joy said with a frown. &#8220;My head hurts and I&#8217;m tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re both big fussers,&#8221; Valiant grumbled. &#8220;I wish I could go swimming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Encouragement poked her head into the room. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t sound very happy in here,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What has gone wrong with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Precious stopped in her doorway. &#8220;Valiant&#8217;s being a big pest. I can&#8217;t stand boys!&#8221; Joy made a whimpering sound from her chair, and Valiant furrowed his brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, my, what a sight to see!&#8221; Encouragement stepped into the room and stared at the three children. &#8220;What has happened to your crown of Love, Precious? And see how your name has changed!&#8221;</p>

<p>Princess Precious took off her crown and saw that it&#8217;s shiny gold color had disappeared. Instead of her own name, &#8220;Murmur&#8221; was written. She felt like saying it was just too hard to be good, but Princess Encouragement spoke. &#8220;Murmur, look up and see how, with your example, the others have become complainers, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, there on her brother and sister&#8217;s heads she could plainly see the words &#8220;Grumble&#8221; and &#8220;Fret.&#8221; Murmur hung her head in shame. King Jesus had given her such a lovely crown, and now she was spoiling it so terribly. At last she asked sadly, &#8220;But what can I do? My crown looks so old and&#8212;and I think King Jesus will be angry.&#8221;</p>

<p>The older princess touched her arm kindly. &#8220;Dear, the King loves you very much and you are still Precious to Him,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But have you never heard of the grace of Rejoice Always? It is a very good polish to keep crowns shiny and bright.&#8221;</p>

<p>Murmur looked up in surprise. &#8220;Where can I get some?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;From King Jesus, of course,&#8221; Encouragement said with a laugh. Murmur hesitated, then hurried out of the room. She was gone several minutes, and during that time Grumble and Fret had a talking to also.</p>

Then she turned to her brother. &#8220;And you are a blessing to have&#8212;let&#8217;s find something fun to do together, for it is a lovely day.&#8221; It seems that Valiant had been quite sorry, too, for he replied with a willing, &#8220;I know just the thing, for I have a very nice book we three can enjoy on the lawn.&#8221;</p>
