<h1>Letters from <i>Dear Princess</i> Readers&#8230;&#8203;</h1>

<h2>Concerning Courtship&#8230;&#8203;</h2>
<p>Greetings to you in our Lord&#8217;s precious name! I pray that this letter finds you well and in joyful spirits.</p>

<p>My name is Jana Marie Baldridge and I am 16. One of my dear friends, Skye Erickson, sent me a copy of your magazine, <i>Dear Princess</i>. I enjoyed reading it and if possible, would like to begin receiving it. You have a wonderful ministry that God is blessing. Also, I would like the back issues when they are all available. Thank you for having Skye send me a copy.</p>

<p>I am also writing regarding the topics you asked for articles about. One was courtship. Do you also print stories? If so, would you be interested in a courtship story for an upcoming issue? My recent burden has been to encourage girls around my age in this area&#8230;. If you are not on the lookout for these kind of stories please feel free to say no.</p>

<p>Thanks again for the copy of <i>Dear Princess</i> and I am looking forward to future issues&#8230;.</p>

<p>Blessings to you!</p>

<h2>Thankful for a Loving Family&#8230;&#8203;</h2>
<p>This is an extremely busy time for me. All of my students are studying hard and learning their Christmas songs. After Christmas we begin working on their Spring Concert Songs, and after that we work on finishing up and winding down for summer break.</p>

<p>Thank you for your <i>Dear Princess</i>. Thank Skye, too, for her little note.</p>

<p>I had just been thinking on the importance of learning obedience. If obedience toward parents is learned as a young person, obedience to God, His voice, and his direction is much easier as an adult.</p>

<p>My life has been packed full with blessings and gifts from God. I think one of the very best gifts is my family. A godly family is a very special thing. There are so many today who haven&#8217;t the family rooted in God. What a special treasure a family is! It is special at Christmas time to realize how much joy can be found in giving beyond &#8220;the normal&#8221; to them and to see their joy in giving to you. I think that at this Thanksgiving time I want to thank God first of all for making me a part of His family, and then giving me (another) earthly home and family, a special treasure of my own parents, brother and sister.</p>

<p>Your &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_4/Open_Doors/index.html" title="Dear Princess 4/Open Doors">Open Doors</a>&#8221; article was a beautiful testimony of the gentle leading and teaching of the Lord. How true it is that our pride is what keeps us from receiving His grace. I&#8217;m so grateful for His patient, loving, merciful heart that continually extends to us all the grace we could ever need. Isn&#8217;t God good?</p>

<p>Thanks again for writing.</p>

<h2>Enjoying the Fellowship&#8230;&#8203;</h2>
<p>Greetings in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I want to thank you for sending <i>Dear Princess</i> to me. I have enjoyed them.</p>

<p>By your articles and notes you have in <i>Dear Princess</i> you seem like such a sweet person who is really trying to follow after the Lord. It is such a blessing to know there are young ladies like you whose goal and number one aim is the Lord.</p>

<p>Well, I suppose I should close for now. May the Lord bless you as you desire to please him in all that you do.</p>

<p>Hello in the wonderful name of our Savior, Jesus Christ!</p>

<p>I recently received the Fall 1997 issue of <i>Dear Princess</i>, from Skye Erickson, who said she thought I would like it. And yes, I did greatly enjoy the whole Fall 1997 issue! I was thrilled to see such dear friends as Becky Schmaltz and Holly Hageman. It was wonderful to see articles from writers in the past (you can glean so much from those in the past!), and I also really liked your article on &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_4/Open_Doors/index.html" title="Dear Princess 4/Open Doors">Open Doors</a>&#8221;&#8230;.
How truly you spoke about the open doors that the Lord brings into our lives and how fast they close when you do not take the opportunity that Christ gave us.</p>

<p>So please put me on your mailing list&#8230;. I would so enjoy receiving <i>Dear Princess</i>! Also, could you send me the (available) back issues? I&#8217;d appreciate it so much&#8230;&#8203;thank you!</p>

<p>God bless you as you strive to glorify Him through <i>Dear Princess</i>!</p>

<p>Thank you for the encouraging newsletter! I enjoyed it very much! It was very thoughtful of you to remember me. Here is a verse for you and your family:
