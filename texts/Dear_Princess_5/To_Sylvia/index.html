<h1>To Sylvia</h1>

<p class="author">Leslie C. Busbee</p>

<p class="verse">In the scope of heaven&#8217;s graces,<br />In the order of His plan,<br />Was unveiled a wondrous blessing,<br />Offered freely unto man.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8217;Twas bond in heaven&#8217;s image:<br />Love, and peace, and harmony,<br />To be showered upon a couple,<br />For each other meant to be.</p>

<p class="verse">Sin beguiled and stole its virtue,<br />In the fall from heights of grace,<br />Man was driven from the garden,<br />And the sunlight of His face.</p>

<p class="verse">Since that day this bond has blighted,<br />For its Maker was not there;<br />Man alone, in sin benighted,<br />Sought its beauty sweet to wear.</p>

<p class="verse">But far short of heaven&#8217;s purpose,<br />And the splendor of His will,<br />Man did miss the blessed union,<br />While remorse his heart did fill.</p>

<p class="verse">Jesus Christ, the Son of heaven,<br />Came&#8212;this union to restore;<br />By His life, so freely given,<br />Blooms its virtue, sweet once more.</p>

<p class="verse">When the call from heaven sounded,<br />How it shook my sinful soul;<br />As upon the Rock I founded,<br />Peace into my heart did roll.</p>

<p class="verse">Casting all my care on Jesus,<br />Sins and burdens, great and small,<br />How I found His love so gracious!<br />And I listened for His call.</p>

<p class="verse">Lessons came&#8212;how I submitted<br />To the wisdom of His grace,<br />And my life and all committed<br />For His love to fully trace.</p>

<p class="verse">His approval became my purpose,<br />Jesus Christ became my goal,<br />And I meant to seek His glory<br />Always, ever in my soul.</p>

<p class="verse">Youth&#8217;s aspires and flowing courses<br />Beat like waves within my heart,<br />And the outer, thronging forces<br />Sought to rend my heart apart.</p>

<p class="verse">But a word from my dear Savior,<br />All the inward strife did still;<br />In the fullness of His favor<br />I submitted to His will.</p>

<p class="verse">Came into my heart His Spirit,<br />All in all, to reign supreme;<br />In the virtue of His merit<br />I did taste the living stream.</p>

<p class="verse">Oh, what joy this great salvation,<br />And its grace did bring to me!<br />Oh, what shining revelation<br />Of His love, so full and free!</p>

<p class="verse">Like bright rays of golden sunlight,<br />Gleamed its glory on my way,<br />Changed my soul from darkest midnight,<br />To the bliss of perfect day.</p>

<p class="verse">Day by day my strength and virtue<br />In His purpose did abound,<br />Then He called to preach the gospel,<br />And the trumpet forth to sound.</p>

<p class="verse">How I shook beneath the burden!<br />But I yielded, praise His name!<br />And the fervent gospel message<br />Set my heart and soul aflame.</p>

<p class="verse">In the dawn of my existence,<br />In the center of His will,<br />While His love and precious presense<br />All my life and love did fill&#8212;</p>

<p class="verse">Shown there on my path a maiden,<br />Virtuous, fair, and pure in heart,<br />And I learned to her acquaintance:<br />In my life she found a part.</p>

<p class="verse">In the midst of other jewels,<br />Like a monarch she did rise,<br />&#8217;Til at last her sacred beauty<br />Caught the affection of mine eyes.</p>

<p class="verse">My desire for a companion<br />Flamed in waves of fervent heat,<br />But I sought the God of heaven<br />To direct and guide my feet.</p>

<p class="verse">Prayer and earnest, meek submission<br />Waged a battle for my soul,<br />&#8217;Til my heart in perfect silence<br />Fully bowed to His control.</p>

<p class="verse">Then one day He gave the witness,<br />And the Knowledge of His will:<br />&#8220;Wait until My gracious wisdom<br />Works this bond thy heart to fill.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Wait until I give the clearness<br />Thy true love to her express,<br />That thy life of love together<br />Might be filled with righteousness.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">Sylvia, ye were that maiden!<br />And my love, it was for thee;<br />But I took the path of wisdom,<br />And the course prescribed for me.</p>

<p class="verse">At the crossroads where I waited<br />With the light a warning red,<br />Tearful of preceeding, prayerful,<br />I maintained the appointed stead.</p>

<p class="verse">Days, weeks, months passed by; I tarried.<br />On the altar ye were lain,<br />And I did withhold my expression,<br />Though it brought me inward pain.</p>

<p class="verse">Oft when I so fain would tell thee,<br />From thy presense I would go,<br />I was made to thee a stranger,<br />Though it seemed to hurt me so.</p>

<p class="verse">What a weight within my bosom,<br />What a cross for me to bear!<br />To deny at His direction<br />My expression to thee there.</p>

<p class="verse">But my faith in Christ I deepened,<br />And I cast it all on Him,<br />Knowing that His gracious promise<br />In that trial would not be dim.</p>

<p class="verse">As I tarried, precious lessons<br />Of our love began to unfold,<br />In the depths of my affliction<br />Found I veins of rarest gold.</p>

<p class="verse">Twenty-two long months I waited,<br />Then at last the way was clear,<br />And I told thee of my affection&#8212;<br />Jesus seemed so close and dear.</p>

<p class="verse">In the path of love and courtship<br />We have walked in heaven&#8217;s will,<br />True and pure to one another;<br />God, His purpose to fulfill.</p>

<p class="verse">Thou wert to me as a garden:<br />Locked, enclosed&#8212;God held the key;<br />In the beauty of His purpose<br />He in love gave it to me.</p>

<p class="verse">In my hand he placed the power<br />To unseal thy fountain pure,<br />Happy was that blessed hour<br />When its grace I did secure.</p>

<p class="verse">Deep within my soul I glory,<br />In the God of peace and love,<br />That His grace provided for me<br />Such a blessing from above.</p>

<p class="verse">I am thankful for the knowledge<br />That His will is fully done,<br />No regret beguiles my bosom&#8212;<br />And today that goal is won.</p>

<p class="verse">For the hour at last is present<br />When I&#8217;ll take thee for my bride,<br />In the smile of our dear Father,<br />And our Savior at His side.</p>

<p class="verse">Let Them witness! Oh, I feel it!<br />Their sweet presense here today!<br />And our wedding, They shall seal it<br />In Their own sweet will and way.</p>

<p class="verse">Friends, whe here are met together:<br />To thy heart, oh, be it known&#8212;<br />God Himself brought us together,<br />God Himself, and He alone.</p>

<p class="verse">We can witness without doubting<br />We are in His perfect will:<br />We are ready for this hour,<br />We are fully yielded, still.</p>

<p class="verse">We are thankful at this moment<br />For the Rock beneath our feet<br />That will give us perfect vict&#8217;ry<br />In each storm of life we meet.</p>

<p class="verse">Oh, dear parents of this maiden,<br />Do not fear this sacred hour,<br />Not one thing this step is marring,<br />God is with us in His pow&#8217;r.</p>

<p class="verse">Do not feel this day so precious<br />Will be one of loss to thee;<br />In thy gift, so pure and gracious,<br />Ye shall gain a son, you see?</p>

<p class="verse">And together we shall brighten<br />All the remnants of thy days,<br />Help thee and thy burdens lighten,<br />For His glory and His praise.</p>

<p class="verse">Now, in Jesus&#8217; name, I ask thee,<br />Come, before the altar stand,<br />With my life, oh, be united;<br />Let us journey hand in hand.</p>

<p class="verse">Let us passs into fair Eden<br />God created for His joy<br />In the beauty of His image,<br />That no foe shall e&#8217;er destroy.</p>

<p class="verse">Cleave to me, and be my treasure,<br />Let us walk life&#8217;s journey through,<br />&#8217;Til our pilgrimage is over<br />At the dawn of life anew.</p>
