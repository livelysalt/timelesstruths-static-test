<h1>About <i>Dear Princess</i></h1>

<h2>What is the Purpose of <i>Dear Princess</i>?</h2>
<p><i>Dear Princess</i> is a publication for young ladies who seek and strive to please their Heavenly Father. I, Abigail Spinks, started in the Fall of 1996 with a burden to share trials and victories, insights and ideas, and in turn to hear of other girls&#8217; trials, victories, insights, and ideas.</p>

<p>In January 1998, I felt a burden to ask Skye Erickson to come and take the place of co-editor. She accepted and this is her first issue of being co-editor for <i>Dear Princess</i>.</p>

<p>We want not only to create a publication with homemaking skills, but one that will encourage girls in becoming spiritually prepared for their future homes. We need to have a vision of trusting the Lord, long before the actual time. If we wait until the time we really need grace to wait for one, we will be ill-prepared. The more grace we have at home with our families now, the more victories we will have behind us in home of our own (if the Lord wills for us to be married).</p>

<p>As my mother says, &#8220;The way you set your sails is the way your ship is going to sail.&#8221; Right now we&#8217;re in the moldable time of our lives. The way we mold ourselves now is the way we&#8217;re going to be when we&#8217;re older. We want to be molded the way Jesus wants us to be, and we know there are other girls who want to as well. We need to encourage each other along the way.</p>

<h1>From the Editor&#8230;&#8203;</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Friends,</p>

<p>As I sit here and ponder about what to write for my first editorial, thoughts come about how the Lord led my way into this situation. When Abigail approached me with the idea of becoming co-editor, I was honestly quite shocked. My first thoughts were, &#8220;Why does Abigail need a co-editor and why did she choose me?&#8221; &#8220;I can&#8217;t do this, I am not capable!&#8221; As you can see, I did not like the idea of being a co-editor.</p>

<p>As I prayed about it and talked it over with Uncle Rick and Aunt Krista, I kept trying to make up excuses of why I couldn&#8217;t fill this position. I tried to weigh out the pros and cons. While many questions and doubts were going through my mind, the Lord brought back to me a verse:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+16%3A11" title="Psalm 16:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 16:11)</span></a></span>
I want to go where the Lord leads me, the path that He chooses for me. I want to go only where His presence would be&#8212;only where His joy would be. &#8220;Which is the path you want me to take, Lord?&#8221;</p>

<p>One night, while the rest of the house was silent, I lay in bed, yearning to know what the Lord wanted me to do. And I knew. Through all the questions and doubts; the excuses, the prayers, I knew the whole time, but did not want to recognize it. Throughout it all, I had a peace in my heart that this was what the Lord wanted me to do. This was the path of life in which He was leading me.</p>

<p>My school and duties within the home will continue to be top priority. Only when my responsibilities here at home are taken care of, will I work on <i>Dear Princess</i>. This is the time the Lord&#8217;s appointed to prepare for our homes and I don&#8217;t want to jeopardize that time. Some of you may say, &#8220;Then why are you even doing this?&#8221; In my heart I felt like the Lord wants me to do this and with His help, I am striving to keep my family and home most important. Pray for me!</p>

<p>My heart&#8217;s desire is to be a blessing and encouragement to you. I pray that I may appear as myself, and nothing other than what I truly am. I know it is easy to come across seeming &#8220;perfect and struggle-free,&#8221; but I am not perfect, nor am I struggle-free. I have my problems, my temptations, my trials, my faults, my weaknesses (as I am sure you&#8217;ll find out!). But I pray that I will do my best to fulfill my position, as unto the Lord. Please pray for wisdom for me; for Abigail; for our work, that we may always glorify the Lord in all we do.</p>

<p>Please feel free to write and ask any questions&#8212;I&#8217;d love to hear from you and will try my best to answer any questions. May the Lord richly bless each of you as you strive to follow in His steps.</p>

<p class="signature">Love in Jesus,<br />Skye</p>

<h1>Letters from <i>Dear Princess</i> Readers&#8230;&#8203;</h1>

<h2>Concerning Courtship&#8230;&#8203;</h2>
<p>Greetings to you in our Lord&#8217;s precious name! I pray that this letter finds you well and in joyful spirits.</p>

<p>My name is Jana Marie Baldridge and I am 16. One of my dear friends, Skye Erickson, sent me a copy of your magazine, <i>Dear Princess</i>. I enjoyed reading it and if possible, would like to begin receiving it. You have a wonderful ministry that God is blessing. Also, I would like the back issues when they are all available. Thank you for having Skye send me a copy.</p>

<p>I am also writing regarding the topics you asked for articles about. One was courtship. Do you also print stories? If so, would you be interested in a courtship story for an upcoming issue? My recent burden has been to encourage girls around my age in this area&#8230;. If you are not on the lookout for these kind of stories please feel free to say no.</p>

<p>Thanks again for the copy of <i>Dear Princess</i> and I am looking forward to future issues&#8230;.</p>

<p>Blessings to you!</p>

<h2>Thankful for a Loving Family&#8230;&#8203;</h2>
<p>This is an extremely busy time for me. All of my students are studying hard and learning their Christmas songs. After Christmas we begin working on their Spring Concert Songs, and after that we work on finishing up and winding down for summer break.</p>

<p>Thank you for your <i>Dear Princess</i>. Thank Skye, too, for her little note.</p>

<p>I had just been thinking on the importance of learning obedience. If obedience toward parents is learned as a young person, obedience to God, His voice, and his direction is much easier as an adult.</p>

<p>My life has been packed full with blessings and gifts from God. I think one of the very best gifts is my family. A godly family is a very special thing. There are so many today who haven&#8217;t the family rooted in God. What a special treasure a family is! It is special at Christmas time to realize how much joy can be found in giving beyond &#8220;the normal&#8221; to them and to see their joy in giving to you. I think that at this Thanksgiving time I want to thank God first of all for making me a part of His family, and then giving me (another) earthly home and family, a special treasure of my own parents, brother and sister.</p>

<p>Your &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_4/Open_Doors/index.html" title="Dear Princess 4/Open Doors">Open Doors</a>&#8221; article was a beautiful testimony of the gentle leading and teaching of the Lord. How true it is that our pride is what keeps us from receiving His grace. I&#8217;m so grateful for His patient, loving, merciful heart that continually extends to us all the grace we could ever need. Isn&#8217;t God good?</p>

<p>Thanks again for writing.</p>

<h2>Enjoying the Fellowship&#8230;&#8203;</h2>
<p>Greetings in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I want to thank you for sending <i>Dear Princess</i> to me. I have enjoyed them.</p>

<p>By your articles and notes you have in <i>Dear Princess</i> you seem like such a sweet person who is really trying to follow after the Lord. It is such a blessing to know there are young ladies like you whose goal and number one aim is the Lord.</p>

<p>Well, I suppose I should close for now. May the Lord bless you as you desire to please him in all that you do.</p>

<p class="signature">In Christ love,<br />Angie Lefevre<br />Cambridge, OH.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Hello in the wonderful name of our Savior, Jesus Christ!</p>

<p>I recently received the Fall 1997 issue of <i>Dear Princess</i>, from Skye Erickson, who said she thought I would like it. And yes, I did greatly enjoy the whole Fall 1997 issue! I was thrilled to see such dear friends as Becky Schmaltz and Holly Hageman. It was wonderful to see articles from writers in the past (you can glean so much from those in the past!), and I also really liked your article on &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_4/Open_Doors/index.html" title="Dear Princess 4/Open Doors">Open Doors</a>&#8221;&#8230;.
How truly you spoke about the open doors that the Lord brings into our lives and how fast they close when you do not take the opportunity that Christ gave us.</p>

<p>So please put me on your mailing list&#8230;. I would so enjoy receiving <i>Dear Princess</i>! Also, could you send me the (available) back issues? I&#8217;d appreciate it so much&#8230;&#8203;thank you!</p>

<p>God bless you as you strive to glorify Him through <i>Dear Princess</i>!</p>

<p>Thank you for the encouraging newsletter! I enjoyed it very much! It was very thoughtful of you to remember me. Here is a verse for you and your family:

<h1>Acceptance with Joy</h1>

<p class="author">Abigail Spinks</p>

<p>I have been thinking about accepting change <i>joyfully</i> and praying that the Lord would give me more grace in that area. How many of us, when we had planned to have a day in town, but have to stay to watch our little siblings, say, &#8220;Sure, Mama, whatever works out is fine with me&#8221;? Or, when it doesn&#8217;t work out to have a special day with a friend like you&#8217;d planned, you don&#8217;t even question why it couldn&#8217;t be <i>made</i> to work?</p>

<p>In the book, <i>Hinds Feet on High Places</i>, when Much-Afraid was going through the desert, there was a tiny flower, the only green living thing, besides straggly cacti, in a lonely corner behind the wall, called Acceptance With Joy. This tiny flower was perfectly happy to be where it was, even though it was living in an almost unlivable desert. It was accepting it&#8217;s place with joyfulness. We need to be accepting our place with joyfulness&#8212;whether you are doing what you&#8217;d planned or something that came up that you hadn&#8217;t planned on. I still have struggles accepting change&#8212;like the other night I had planned on having a friend over, and after prayer meeting she told me she wouldn&#8217;t be able to stay. It was a trial to me and I had a hard time accepting the change with joy. I thought, <i>Well if she wouldn&#8217;t be able to stay, why did they have to wait till the night she was to spend to tell me that she couldn&#8217;t?</i> But the Lord was faithful to me and helped me understand that those kind of feelings were not of Him and I needed to accept this change joyfully.</p>

<p>My mother has often repeated this saying that someone had told her, &#8220;There is nothing so permanent as change,&#8221; and that is true. There <i>is</i> nothing so permanent as change. Life is always changing. We can stumble through life always disappointed, because just as we were set, it changed. But if we have the grace of God in our hearts, we will accept change with joy. It will be a joy to have change, because it gives us a chance for the grace of God to shine out of us. That doesn&#8217;t mean that the change isn&#8217;t disappointing, but when we have given our desires to the Lord, He gives us a blessing that is worth so much more than getting to do what we wanted. I know a sister that used to have trouble accepting change. But she got more of the grace of God in her heart and now it is a real blessing and encouragement to see how she accepts changes joyfully.</p>

<p>Dear sisters, press toward the mark, get more of the grace of God in you to accept change. It is such a blessing to receive change joyfully&#8212;to you and also your family. The Lord blesses us when we don&#8217;t contend or wish that our circumstances were different. Often times the Lord will test us just to see how much we do trust Him that everything will work out. It is sweet (once we aren&#8217;t struggling to find out why) to be content to accept whatever changes comes along. It is so peaceful to know whatever comes along, is His will, and it is my job to only trust and accept with joy.</p>

<h1>Religion</h1>

<p class="author">Jennie C. Rutty</p>

<p>Dear Girls:</p>

<p>What pleasure it would give me to have a good, quiet talk with you on this subject, of which you doubtless have heard much, and upon which you have thought more than you would be willing to confess. If I were with you and could look into your faces, some of the emotions of your hearts could be seen there, and it might be much easier to help you out of the perplexities that surround this most important subject.</p>

<p>But I am truly thankful for the privilege of writing to you, and will do all I can to help you to decide for yourselves which is the religion that will be profitable for this life and in death. From the letters written you can see how impossible it is to write on any subject without including something pertaining to religion; for it is woven in and out in various ways through every circumstance and condition in the life of everyone of us, though we may not have known it. Oh, how necessary for each one to carefully examine into everything connected with so serious, so weighty, and so sacred a matter&#8212;the welfare of precious souls! There are some who scoff at religion, and think, or try to make themselves think, that it is foolish. They laugh and make sport and count themselves very high-minded and brave in resisting all endeavors to win them to more serious thought, and delight to appear very hard-hearted. How little they know what they are doing!</p>

<p>When in my seventeenth year, I left my country home and school to enter a high school. My heart was very tender, and any little affecting incident related in public or private would bring tears to my eyes. Soon, noticing that most of the student girls did not show any emotion, and a few times catching a look of ridicule cast upon myself, I began to resist every tender and true feeling that moved my heart. In a very short time it seemed to be turned to stone; and love, sympathy, kindness, and gentleness had fled, and I was so alone; no one near or dear to me; cold, superficial, living only for myself. I grew alarmed and can well remember humbling myself before God and entreating Him to give me a tender heart; and though I knew not the way of salvation, He answered my cry and gave me my desire. May this warn some not to harden their hearts, and may it show some the remedy. If you could only realize the weight of your words and actions on others, you surely would be very careful how you treat religion. Many girls are under religious influence, but are not attracted thereby because the allurement of worldly things is stronger. Are you acting wisely? It has been acknowledged that man is a religious being; there is a nature within that desires to love and worship some god: therefore, without instruction even savages have their worship. Anything thus honored is an idol or god. Idols of gold, silver, wood, and stone, graven by art and man&#8217;s device, have been worshipped and honored in various ways. Different religions with creed and form of worship are found in every nation. But there is but one pure religion, one God who is worthy of worship; though he is an unknown God to many, he is maker of all things, and commands us to love and serve him alone. We are His offspring and each has an immortal soul, which is only satisfied by the pure religion.</p>

<p>There was a man of India who was trying to find something to satisfy his spiritual nature. He tried first one religion and then another until he had tried all he knew of, but as he expressed it, &#8220;I thirsted still&#8221;; for not one of them supplied the longing desire of the soul. A missionary was scattering the leaves of testaments among the people and one was given to this man, who carried it home with him many miles, and with much difficulty had it read to him. The leaf was from the gospel of John and included these verses:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+4%3A13-14" title="John 4:13-14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 4:13-14)</span></a></span>
These words so pleased him that he journeyed back to the distant town where he had obtained the leaf, to find the missionary and learn more of this wonderful religion. His labor was rewarded; for he found the Lord&#8217;s servant, who instructed him in the way of salvation until he obtained the Spirit of God, which is the well of living water. So much did he appreciate what he had obtained that he spent the rest of his life in visiting from house to house, telling to many the good news, that there was a religion that could satisfy every longing of the soul.</p>

<p>Every religion holds out inducements to attract and retain individuals to its worship; and the adversary of all good, the devil, uses these religions to deceive souls that he may delight in their destruction. But everyone who is intensely earnest and perfectly honest before God to know what is the pure religion, will find help from Him. This pure religion is very closely counterfeited, and these counterfeits offer many like attractions; but as the impure coin can be discerned by detective skill, so these impure religions can be discovered by the strong detectives&#8212;the Holy Spirit and the word of God. Hence, we see the need of careful and prayerful study of God&#8217;s word, the Holy Bible; and in this land of religious freedom, no one is excusable for neglecting such an important duty. But you say you do not love to read it, and think it dull and unattractive. If you were as earnest to know about things concerning the soul as everyone should be, you would think you had found a precious gold mine, and would begin to dig for its hidden treasure. While there are many very precious things all may comprehend by its careful study, yet the deepest, most sacred and joyous truths are reserved for those who are truly worshipers of the true God; for they have the Holy Spirit, who unfolds or reveals the things of God. The God of love, our Father, offers to all who will faithfully love and serve him, an endless life of glory in a beautiful place prepared for them. He gives a salvation that saves and purifies his subjects from sin, bringing each one into perfect harmony with His will, thus making this life one of purest joy.</p>

<p>Some think the religion of the Bible a severe service they see only the outward things, that with their natural hearts seem to be very disagreeable. But that is not true. The service of the Lord is just right, and suits perfectly every one that loves him with the whole heart. Could a kind and loving father require anything of his children that would not be for their good? God is our Father and is more loving than our natural parents. Therefore we know His service is not severe or in any way contrary to us when we are His by the new birth; for
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Ye must be born again.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+3%3A7" title="John 3:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 3:7)</span></a></span>
The joy of the Lord is as far above the joy of the world as heaven is above the earth, and can only be understood by those who have experienced it in pure salvation.</p>

<p>Now, dear girls, as I desire for you that which will be for your greatest good, my prayer is that you may become more earnest in considering this subject.</p>

<h1>A Letter from an Older Sister</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sister Abigail,</p>

<p>Greetings to you in the name of our dear Jesus, and also to your sister and parents. I was thrilled to receive your little paper and to see how the Lord is using you to work for Him. How dare you say I don&#8217;t know you, when I was one of the first to see you when you arrived on this earth! Your sister, Coquetta, stayed with us while you were born, and I got a peek at you when your mom and dad came to pick her up. But no doubt your memories of that are foggy&#8230;.</p>

<p>Yes, my dear, there is something I would like to pass along to you and anyone else who is interested, that I wish I had known when I was your age. The secret to a successful Christian life, whether male of female, young or old, parent or single, is to learn for oneself, as early as possible, the great, pure, unfailing, unconditional love that God has for each one of us, and to be able to accept it for yourself. For many years I came to the Lord as &#8220;my parent&#8217;s child,&#8221; in a sense; I knew He loved them, and I sort of tried to shelter under that umbrella. Later I was close to an older sister with whom I prayed often, and I always felt my prayers were more effective when with her because I knew the Lord loved her. Then circumstances ended those opportunities for close fellowship, and I was left on my own to fight some serious battles with self.</p>

<p>One day I was thinking of Jesus and His love for mankind when I began to realize that He doesn&#8217;t love me with a general, one-size-fits-all love, as I had supposed, but with a personal, particular love for me, myself. Always when someone said, &#8220;I love you,&#8221; I had the secret thought, &#8220;If you really knew me, you wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221; Suddenly I realized that here was Someone who knew all about me; all my meanness and failings and secret shortcomings, and that it didn&#8217;t matter to Him! He loved me anyway&#8212;me, myself&#8212;not because I am my mother&#8217;s child, not tolerating me because I am the friend of someone He loves, but just for myself&#8212;asking nothing in return, not requiring that I earn His love or deserve it, just pouring it out on me because <b>He is Love</b>! This is not something I can really explain&#8212;you have to experience it for yourself to make it real&#8212;but this knowledge has changed my life. Because I have His free, unconditional love, I can love others freely. Because I feel myself so beloved by Him, I am able to talk to Him of all the secret things I could never tell anyone, without feeling scared or vulnerable or defensive. Because of this marvelous love, I can reach out to people who don&#8217;t love or even know me, and not feel hurt or rejected if they don&#8217;t respond. Being sure of God&#8217;s love brings the most wonderful freedom you can imagine. There&#8217;s no room for insecurity or inferiority or loneliness of any sort. His love feels every need and satisfies every longing, just as the song says. Here is how I saw Jesus&#8217; love for me:</p>

<p>Once I was visiting with an older man, a friend, when his beloved young daughter walked in the room unexpectedly. I was moved to tears to see how his face lighted up when he saw her, how he got up quickly to welcome her, his surprise and delight at this visit. As I thought on this later, the Lord said to me, &#8220;That&#8217;s how I feel about you.&#8221; I almost felt that I was His favorite! But in truth, we are all His favorites. Did He not give the parable of the one lost sheep, and again the lost coin? How sad that we often fail to accept that love as a personal reality, as I did for so long. What a waste! As if someone had died and left me a rich inheritance, but I go through life a beggar simply because I don&#8217;t claim what was given to me. My advice to you and all who haven&#8217;t already found this love personally is to get on your knees and ask the Lord to reveal it to you. Why go through life without it when it&#8217;s there and it&#8217;s yours?! Why see God as a stern, reproving taskmaster, when He&#8217;s your Father, your Daddy, even and your best friend? Once as I poured out my love to Him, in my spirit I felt Him put His hand on my head and call me &#8220;Daughter.&#8221; If you don&#8217;t have that relationship with Him, don&#8217;t waste another minute of your life without it!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m praying for you and Coquetta that the Lord will bless you both, teach and nurture you and draw you closer to Him. It&#8217;s so encouraging to see young people eager to work for the Lord.</p>

<p>With much love in Christ,<br />Sister Patsy Cain<br />The Village, OK.</p>

<h1>Waiting for His Best in Marriage</h1>

<p class="author">Amy Zander</p>

<p>More and more, the Lord is convicting and encouraging me that, yes, my family and I are doing things the Lord&#8217;s way and that courtship is the right path to take.</p>

<p>I recently came upon an essay that just touched my heart, and so blessed me, and I would like to share it with you. I don&#8217;t know who wrote this, but it is titled &#8220;God&#8217;s Choice,&#8221; and it&#8217;s my prayer and desire to wait on the Lord, let Him have His will and way in my life, and to give my whole self to God, just as this essay states.</p>

<p>Girls, don&#8217;t race on ahead and say, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get married!&#8221; Don&#8217;t just concentrate on being courted and getting married. Be willing to surrender your all to Christ and say, &#8220;I will be content with whatever Your will for my life is, even if it doesn&#8217;t include marriage, or something that I desire.&#8221; I am looking forward to marriage and being a wife and mother. That is what I desire to be, but one day I gave those desires to Jesus and have come to know that if I will let Him have 100% control of my life, I will always have what the Lord wants me to have, which is always the best! After all, we must learn to make Jesus Christ the center of our lives, realizing that having a relationship with Him is all that we need.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. Take therefore no thought for the morrow.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+6%3A33-34" title="Matthew 6:33-34"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 6:33-34)</span></a></span>
Seek the Lord, and everything else will fall into place.</p>

<blockquote>
<h2>God&#8217;s Choice</h2>
<p class="noindent">Author Unkown</p>

<p>Every girl longs to give herself completely to someone, to have a deep relationship with another, to be loved thoroughly and completely and exclusively.</p>

<p>But to His child, the Lord says, &#8220;No, not until you are satisfied, fulfilled and content with being loved by Me, with giving yourself totally and unreservedly to Me, to have an intensely personal and unique relationship with Me alone, discovering that only in Me is your satisfaction to be found, will you be capable of the perfect human relationship with another. You will never be happily united with Me, exclusive of anyone else or anything else, exclusive of any other desire or longing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to <b>stop</b> planning, <b>stop</b> wishing, and allow <b>Me</b> to give you the most thrilling plans existing&#8212;ones that you cannot imagine. I want you to have the <b>best</b>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please allow <b>Me</b> to bring him to you. You just keep watching <b>Me</b>, expecting the <b>greatest</b>, keep experiencing the <b>greatest</b>, and keep experiencing the satisfaction that <b>I Am</b>&#8230;&#8203;keep listening and learning the things I tell you. <b>Just wait&#8230;&#8203;that&#8217;s all.</b> And when you are ready, I&#8217;ll surprise you with the love far more wonderful than <b>any</b> you would dream. You see, until you are ready, and until the one I have for you is ready&#8212;I&#8217;m working at this very moment to have one ready at the same time. Until you are both satisfied <b>exclusively</b> with <b>Me</b>, and the life I&#8217;ve given you, you won&#8217;t be able to experience the love that exemplifies your relationship with <b>Me</b>, and is then the &#8216;perfect love.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, Dear One, I want you to have the most and wonderful love. I want you in the flesh to have a picture of your relationship with Me and to enjoy <b>completely</b> the everlasting union of beauty, perfection, and love that <b>I offer you</b>. Know that I love you <b>utterly</b>. Believe it and be <b>satisfied</b>.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>


<p>I hope that this short essay has helped and encouraged you. Truly God&#8217;s best for you and me is the best of all!</p>

<h1>A True Courtship Story</h1>

<div class="blurb">
<p class="first">An older sister, Sylvia Busbee of Oklahoma, shares her story with girls of today. Interviewed by Laura and Skye Erickson</p>

</div>


<h3>How did the Lord deal with you as a young girl as you began thinking of marriage?</h3>
<p>When I was a young girl, before I ever got saved, I had the training that I wanted to have a happy Christian home. When boys wanted to get too familiar with me I said, &#8220;No, I want to keep myself for a pure husband and a pure home.&#8221; And I kept myself pure.</p>

<h3>Did anyone influence you in your values for courtship?</h3>
<p>I had high standards about it, and after I got saved I began to pray that the Lord would give me the right companion. I had two different young men to court me and both were ministers (this was right after I had gotten saved). I really sought the Lord and prayed about it, for these young men were not really devoted&#8212;they let the world and their desire for a companion come into their life more than living and preaching the Word of God. I told them that I thought they ought to put their hearts into the work of the Lord and establish that first, and then seek a companion. They didn&#8217;t do that, but went and got married. Now neither of them are married nor saved.</p>

<p>As I grew older, there weren&#8217;t any other young men around, and I gave myself to the Lord and committed it to Him.</p>

<h3>Did you consecrate to be single?</h3>
<p>After those two young ministers left and married someone else, I thought, &#8220;Lord, You can be my companion,&#8221; and I wept and prayed about it. A lot of times when I&#8217;d come home from work my mother would be away at the housing project teaching children, so I would use that time to pray. I would tell the Lord that He knew that I was just half&#8212;that there was another half of me somewhere and if it was His will, that He would direct me. I knew of no one eligible and so I thought, &#8220;If there is going to be one, then the Lord will just have to manufacture him.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a man at work who smiled at me, and I thought, &#8220;Lord, maybe he has potential.&#8221; He was older than myself and not married, which was unusual because I was already in my twenties. I put a notice on the board about our assembly meeting, and signed my name. I thought if he was interested in me then he would come and see about what I believed. If he was interested in me, he might be interested in living for the Lord. But he didn&#8217;t come, so I relapsed that thought completely and said, &#8220;Lord, I don&#8217;t want to marry anyone that is not interested in You.&#8221; And so I left him alone. Later he married one of the girls of our congregation that worked there also, but it only lasted two years. I thanked the Lord I didn&#8217;t get into that. I just decided I could live without a companion, but I really was praying constantly about it.</p>

<p>Then it was presented to me about coming to work at the print shop in Guthrie. Sister Marie came to our house and said to me, &#8220;Sylvia, I want you to pray about coming to the print shop, for there is an opening there.&#8221; I was twenty-three then, and it just seemed like it was the right thing to do. So I left my home and told my mommy and daddy that I felt that this was what the Lord wanted me to do. They were very happy, for if I had to leave home they were glad I was to be with someone they knew and trusted. I was going to live with Sister Marie and Brother Pruitt in their home. I didn&#8217;t go off and get an apartment. I just don&#8217;t think girls ought to do that. I know one girl who did, and she got into trouble. An older man came to visit her and she went off with him, though he was someone else&#8217;s husband. That was such a sad thing that happened. Girls shouldn&#8217;t go and live by themselves, yet I know sometimes that it is necessary. If they go out maybe they can stay at loved ones, but even then sometimes it isn&#8217;t the right thing to do. If a young girl lives in a home with another young couple, she can get involved with that husband. It is possible, so be careful.</p>

<h3>How old were you when you actually started courting someone?</h3>
<p>I went out with a couple of boys (before I was saved) several times when I was in high school before and after I graduated. These boys were in the Korean War and one of them was killed. The other I wrote and shared how I had gotten saved, wasn&#8217;t wearing makeup any more, and how I felt the Lord had a young man for me. We told each other goodbye as he wrote back to say that he wished the best for me. I knew all the time that I couldn&#8217;t marry that man because he wasn&#8217;t of my faith.</p>

<h3>How did you meet your future husband?</h3>
<p>When I came to the print shop, Sister Marie introduced me to different ones and said, &#8220;This is our new girl we are going to have at the print shop.&#8221; And she introduced me to Leslie. At that time he was just out of high school and I was twenty-three. I didn&#8217;t have any thoughts about him, because he was just a young man of seventeen&#8212;almost eighteen. He was going with another girl, so I didn&#8217;t pay any attention to him. He was around a lot and started preaching the next January. He began going with Brother Pruitt on Sundays on his appointments at different congregations. Every fourth Sunday they would go to the Enid congregation, where they didn&#8217;t have a pastor. Brother Pruitt was getting older and asked Leslie to go along, because he couldn&#8217;t preach two times every Sunday. Sister Marie would often go and I nearly always went along, for I could help drive and lead the singing. I also taught the children&#8217;s class. Since I always did this, Leslie and I were together a lot. We sang together with others for funerals and weddings and up front for specials. He would come over to the print shop and help out with the paper, so he began to notice me. After awhile he left off all those other girls and began to seek the Lord for what He wanted him to do for a companion. The Lord showed him that it was me. Leslie drove a school bus then, and can show you the very spot on the road where the Lord told him, &#8220;It&#8217;s Sylvia, but you have to wait until I tell you.&#8221; It was nearly two years before he got the &#8220;go signal.&#8221;</p>

<h3>How did you conduct your courtship?</h3>
<p>During this two-year wait, Leslie was rather cold to me. He was finding out that he loved me and couldn&#8217;t express it, for the Lord said, &#8220;No.&#8221; This was puzzling to me, and it hurt. But we were still together a lot and different ones would try to say we were going together and different things were put out about it. Leslie always said, &#8220;No, it&#8217;s not true.&#8221; We were very careful. We made a trip together with Sister Stover, Sister Geneva, and her little boy all the way to Oregon. That was pretty hard as he didn&#8217;t show any affection to me at all.</p>

<p>Finally on a January day at the print shop, when everybody began leaving, the Lord told Leslie, &#8220;This is your chance. This is the time. You tell her what you have on your heart.&#8221; I was still working on the linotype out in the back. He came and said he wanted to talk to me, so I turned off the machine. He said, &#8220;I believe the Lord has showed me that we have a future together. I know this is hard for you to answer right now and I don&#8217;t expect you to. You just think and pray about it and I&#8217;ll see you later.&#8221; And he took off.</p>

<p>He was gone a couple of weeks to a meeting and a funeral somewhere in Missouri, and so when he got back he called me and said he would like to be with me a little bit. Soon the folks at the print shop began realizing that this was the beginning of our courtship. We decided in ourselves not to touch knees, not to touch shoulders, and we did not hold hands. One time he pressed a dime a little hard into my hand. Afterwards he asked me and the Lord to forgive him. We never stayed out late or sat out in the car. We didn&#8217;t sit in Church service together until we were engaged. He brought me home at a decent hour if we went anywhere after meeting. Sometimes we&#8217;d go and get something, but we didn&#8217;t have much money so we didn&#8217;t do it very often. We didn&#8217;t really spend much money on each other at all.</p>

<h3>What were your parents&#8217; feelings about it?</h3>
<p>When I told my mother and father they were very excited, for Leslie had gone out to California and stayed in their home when he had meeting out there. My daddy was growing older, and he was so happy that the Lord was finally giving me a companion. He felt that as long as I was unmarried he was still responsible for me, but when I got married and had a home of my own he was no longer responsible. My Daddy died about six months after we were married. They couldn&#8217;t have felt any better about our marriage.</p>

<h3>How were you assured that this was the man that God had chosen for you?</h3>
<p>One time, before we began courting, he went on a little trip with another minister&#8217;s family and their daughter. I knew they were going to be together and so I prayed earnestly, &#8220;Lord, if Leslie is to marry this girl, if she is the one, (for she was a sweet girl and more his age), if they are for each other, then relinquish my feelings even though I love Leslie.&#8221; I prayed about him because somehow I felt that he was entering into my life, even though he was so cold to me. There were times when he gave me a look with his eyes, and I knew something was there. I was beginning to fall in love and so I said to the Lord, &#8220;I do not want to fall in love with this man if he is not the one.&#8221; I had had already one heartbreak, and didn&#8217;t want to fall in love if he wasn&#8217;t going to work out for me. I also prayed that the Lord would give him the right one, even though I might not be the girl. I loved him, but I wanted him to have the one the Lord had for him. Then the Lord told me, &#8220;Now I know you love Me, for the sacrifice you&#8217;ve made&#8221; (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+22%3A12">Genesis 22:12</a>). So He blessed me there.</p>

<h3>What about your engagement?</h3>
<p>When we had been going together for about three months, we made a little trip to a meeting down in Louisiana with Sister Marie and her husband. He could have asked me to marry him, down in a lovely garden, but he didn&#8217;t. However, when we got home, he asked, and I said yes. I believe it was in March, there in the Print Shop office.</p>

<p>I began making my wedding plans and we set the date for July. The engagement wouldn&#8217;t be that lengthy and my parents would come from California anyway for the Monarch meeting. We felt that it was a good time. We continued to carry on our engagement as we did our courtship&#8212;with purity. We talked and always had prayer together and talked about the Lord. It was just so sweet. He wrote poems to me, and we were together every night except Monday. We felt that it was a good thing for us to have a night to ourselves. That was the time I washed my hair and did other things for myself. Leslie would call me on the phone, but we did not see each other that night. That was a little relaxed time for us. Tuesday night we had Bible study, Wednesday was prayer meeting, Thursday we were at the old peoples&#8217; home for meeting and Friday night was young people&#8217;s night. Saturday we went out for lemonade or something. But like I said, we didn&#8217;t have much money.</p>

<h3>Could you please tell us about your wedding day?</h3>
<p>When I began to plan my wedding, I kept in mind that I wanted the Lord to be there and sit in our wedding. I prayed that the Lord would help me, and Leslie had his own feelings about weddings also. We wanted it to be simple without a lot of fanfare. I wanted my wedding dress to be modest, and I believe the Lord helped me to make it like He wanted it to be. It was rather long, but not floor length. It didn&#8217;t cost a whole lot of money either. Sister Inez made my wedding cake. It was a plain tiered cake, without anything fancy on it. Aunt Hatty loaned me some lacy green curtains which I hung up behind the wedding cake in the old dining hail at the Guthrie Chapel.</p>

<p>Leslie didn&#8217;t want me to walk down the aisle, so we came in together and sat down before the morning service. The minister preached that morning on the church and how beautiful she was and how Christ will come for her, His Bride. It went right in with our little wedding. Then after a song, we stood up and Leslie had a long poem he wanted to say to me [<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_5/To_Sylvia/index.html">To Sylvia</a>].
He told about how the Lord chose me for him and many were touched.</p>

<p>Just my parents stood with me. Many saints, friends and relatives were there. We had wedding gifts coming from several congregations, and after a lunch reception, we opened our gifts.</p>

<p>We didn&#8217;t kiss at our wedding, because we decided ahead of time we didn&#8217;t want to do that yet. So we went out the door and back to the Sunday school room and he kissed me for the first time. While everyone was waiting to congratulate us, we weren&#8217;t there. Later we got back in the reception line and many told us, crying, that it was the sweetest wedding they had ever been at.</p>

<h3>Has your marriage turned out as you thought it would?</h3>
<p>Oh, yes! We had a little honeymoon planned and drove away that night towards the Roaring River in Missouri. Later we went over to his Uncle Darius and Aunt Evelyn&#8217;s house. They had gone and said we could stay there. Then we went over to the Monarch Camp Meeting. We had been married on Sunday and were at Monarch by Thursday!</p>

<p>We didn&#8217;t have any plans of where we were going to live. Leslie just had a little green Chevrolet and two suitcases and that was it. He didn&#8217;t even have enough money to buy a marriage license&#8212;I paid it. We started out by faith and just went from there. We spent the rest of the summer with Brother and Sister Stover, going to Oregon and California, and finally back to the print shop.</p>

<p>Leslie then felt like the Lord wanted us to go to Anthony, Kansas. So we went up there and found a little apartment, and that is where we started. We stayed there for 3 1/2 years and two of our boys were born there. Then the Lord showed Leslie that he wanted us to move to Springfield. I felt the same way. We stayed in Springfield for eight years and had three more children there. The Lord took our oldest little boy to heaven while living there. The Lord has led us. We didn&#8217;t have much to start with and Leslie didn&#8217;t work steadily, but he did find work. Sometimes we got a bit short, but the Lord really blessed us in those times. It was a time of growing&#8212;I wouldn&#8217;t trade it for anything. I think it has been a wonderful life together.</p>

<p>The Lord led us away from Springfield, and so we left, though it was very hard to do. During this time the saints at the Enid, Oklahoma, congregation prayed that we would come to Enid, and invited us. Even when we moved to Springfield they wanted us to come. After a period of time we moved to Guthrie where we lived for fifteen years. After that time we felt that perhaps someone else could be used there, and so the Lord directed us to finally come to Enid. These saints have been so happy and we have been happy and blessed also. Moving to Enid was just like moving to another part of our family&#8212;it wasn&#8217;t strange at all.</p>

<p>Leslie and I realize, now that our family is gone, that we just have each other. We are working on our relationship day by day, and it seems like we are growing closer all the time. We have a wonderful foundation to build on, as you can see. We have had a few stormy times, and some hard places, but our foundation was laid and it was a sure foundation that we built on. That is why our marriage is enduring. It is so sad to see young people now, for most don&#8217;t have that foundation under them. They haven&#8217;t put their consecration and sacrifice to prayer and seeking the Lord, and I am fearful for them.</p>

<p>Seek earnestly, girls, to know God&#8217;s will for your life and trust Him for a companion. When you are married, always pray together, for this resolves all disagreements and brings you closer together. How happy are they that do it the Lord&#8217;s way!</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<div class="blurb">
<p class="first">Editor&#8217;s note:</p>

<p>The Lord has placed each one of us in our families, each with different backgrounds, each with unique ideas and ways. We feel God has not laid down a certain method for each courtship; each experience will be different and unique in their own way. One thing will be the same&#8212;God wants to bring each of us to a place of consecration for our future. He wants our lives to be totally dependent upon Him and His ways.</p>

<p>This is just one of the many courtship stories out there. We were blessed with the purity in the Busbee&#8217;s courtship and how the Lord led and prepared their hearts for each other. We hope, in the future, to hear of other courtship stories in which the Lord was leading and His will was sought.</p>

<h1>To Sylvia</h1>

<p class="author">Leslie C. Busbee</p>

<p class="verse">In the scope of heaven&#8217;s graces,<br />In the order of His plan,<br />Was unveiled a wondrous blessing,<br />Offered freely unto man.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8217;Twas bond in heaven&#8217;s image:<br />Love, and peace, and harmony,<br />To be showered upon a couple,<br />For each other meant to be.</p>

<p class="verse">Sin beguiled and stole its virtue,<br />In the fall from heights of grace,<br />Man was driven from the garden,<br />And the sunlight of His face.</p>

<p class="verse">Since that day this bond has blighted,<br />For its Maker was not there;<br />Man alone, in sin benighted,<br />Sought its beauty sweet to wear.</p>

<p class="verse">But far short of heaven&#8217;s purpose,<br />And the splendor of His will,<br />Man did miss the blessed union,<br />While remorse his heart did fill.</p>

<p class="verse">Jesus Christ, the Son of heaven,<br />Came&#8212;this union to restore;<br />By His life, so freely given,<br />Blooms its virtue, sweet once more.</p>

<p class="verse">When the call from heaven sounded,<br />How it shook my sinful soul;<br />As upon the Rock I founded,<br />Peace into my heart did roll.</p>

<p class="verse">Casting all my care on Jesus,<br />Sins and burdens, great and small,<br />How I found His love so gracious!<br />And I listened for His call.</p>

<p class="verse">Lessons came&#8212;how I submitted<br />To the wisdom of His grace,<br />And my life and all committed<br />For His love to fully trace.</p>

<p class="verse">His approval became my purpose,<br />Jesus Christ became my goal,<br />And I meant to seek His glory<br />Always, ever in my soul.</p>

<p class="verse">Youth&#8217;s aspires and flowing courses<br />Beat like waves within my heart,<br />And the outer, thronging forces<br />Sought to rend my heart apart.</p>

<p class="verse">But a word from my dear Savior,<br />All the inward strife did still;<br />In the fullness of His favor<br />I submitted to His will.</p>

<p class="verse">Came into my heart His Spirit,<br />All in all, to reign supreme;<br />In the virtue of His merit<br />I did taste the living stream.</p>

<p class="verse">Oh, what joy this great salvation,<br />And its grace did bring to me!<br />Oh, what shining revelation<br />Of His love, so full and free!</p>

<p class="verse">Like bright rays of golden sunlight,<br />Gleamed its glory on my way,<br />Changed my soul from darkest midnight,<br />To the bliss of perfect day.</p>

<p class="verse">Day by day my strength and virtue<br />In His purpose did abound,<br />Then He called to preach the gospel,<br />And the trumpet forth to sound.</p>

<p class="verse">How I shook beneath the burden!<br />But I yielded, praise His name!<br />And the fervent gospel message<br />Set my heart and soul aflame.</p>

<p class="verse">In the dawn of my existence,<br />In the center of His will,<br />While His love and precious presense<br />All my life and love did fill&#8212;</p>

<p class="verse">Shown there on my path a maiden,<br />Virtuous, fair, and pure in heart,<br />And I learned to her acquaintance:<br />In my life she found a part.</p>

<p class="verse">In the midst of other jewels,<br />Like a monarch she did rise,<br />&#8217;Til at last her sacred beauty<br />Caught the affection of mine eyes.</p>

<p class="verse">My desire for a companion<br />Flamed in waves of fervent heat,<br />But I sought the God of heaven<br />To direct and guide my feet.</p>

<p class="verse">Prayer and earnest, meek submission<br />Waged a battle for my soul,<br />&#8217;Til my heart in perfect silence<br />Fully bowed to His control.</p>

<p class="verse">Then one day He gave the witness,<br />And the Knowledge of His will:<br />&#8220;Wait until My gracious wisdom<br />Works this bond thy heart to fill.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Wait until I give the clearness<br />Thy true love to her express,<br />That thy life of love together<br />Might be filled with righteousness.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">Sylvia, ye were that maiden!<br />And my love, it was for thee;<br />But I took the path of wisdom,<br />And the course prescribed for me.</p>

<p class="verse">At the crossroads where I waited<br />With the light a warning red,<br />Tearful of preceeding, prayerful,<br />I maintained the appointed stead.</p>

<p class="verse">Days, weeks, months passed by; I tarried.<br />On the altar ye were lain,<br />And I did withhold my expression,<br />Though it brought me inward pain.</p>

<p class="verse">Oft when I so fain would tell thee,<br />From thy presense I would go,<br />I was made to thee a stranger,<br />Though it seemed to hurt me so.</p>

<p class="verse">What a weight within my bosom,<br />What a cross for me to bear!<br />To deny at His direction<br />My expression to thee there.</p>

<p class="verse">But my faith in Christ I deepened,<br />And I cast it all on Him,<br />Knowing that His gracious promise<br />In that trial would not be dim.</p>

<p class="verse">As I tarried, precious lessons<br />Of our love began to unfold,<br />In the depths of my affliction<br />Found I veins of rarest gold.</p>

<p class="verse">Twenty-two long months I waited,<br />Then at last the way was clear,<br />And I told thee of my affection&#8212;<br />Jesus seemed so close and dear.</p>

<p class="verse">In the path of love and courtship<br />We have walked in heaven&#8217;s will,<br />True and pure to one another;<br />God, His purpose to fulfill.</p>

<p class="verse">Thou wert to me as a garden:<br />Locked, enclosed&#8212;God held the key;<br />In the beauty of His purpose<br />He in love gave it to me.</p>

<p class="verse">In my hand he placed the power<br />To unseal thy fountain pure,<br />Happy was that blessed hour<br />When its grace I did secure.</p>

<p class="verse">Deep within my soul I glory,<br />In the God of peace and love,<br />That His grace provided for me<br />Such a blessing from above.</p>

<p class="verse">I am thankful for the knowledge<br />That His will is fully done,<br />No regret beguiles my bosom&#8212;<br />And today that goal is won.</p>

<p class="verse">For the hour at last is present<br />When I&#8217;ll take thee for my bride,<br />In the smile of our dear Father,<br />And our Savior at His side.</p>

<p class="verse">Let Them witness! Oh, I feel it!<br />Their sweet presense here today!<br />And our wedding, They shall seal it<br />In Their own sweet will and way.</p>

<p class="verse">Friends, whe here are met together:<br />To thy heart, oh, be it known&#8212;<br />God Himself brought us together,<br />God Himself, and He alone.</p>

<p class="verse">We can witness without doubting<br />We are in His perfect will:<br />We are ready for this hour,<br />We are fully yielded, still.</p>

<p class="verse">We are thankful at this moment<br />For the Rock beneath our feet<br />That will give us perfect vict&#8217;ry<br />In each storm of life we meet.</p>

<p class="verse">Oh, dear parents of this maiden,<br />Do not fear this sacred hour,<br />Not one thing this step is marring,<br />God is with us in His pow&#8217;r.</p>

<p class="verse">Do not feel this day so precious<br />Will be one of loss to thee;<br />In thy gift, so pure and gracious,<br />Ye shall gain a son, you see?</p>

<p class="verse">And together we shall brighten<br />All the remnants of thy days,<br />Help thee and thy burdens lighten,<br />For His glory and His praise.</p>

<p class="verse">Now, in Jesus&#8217; name, I ask thee,<br />Come, before the altar stand,<br />With my life, oh, be united;<br />Let us journey hand in hand.</p>

<p class="verse">Let us passs into fair Eden<br />God created for His joy<br />In the beauty of His image,<br />That no foe shall e&#8217;er destroy.</p>

<p class="verse">Cleave to me, and be my treasure,<br />Let us walk life&#8217;s journey through,<br />&#8217;Til our pilgrimage is over<br />At the dawn of life anew.</p>

<h1>Beautiful Things</h1>

<p class="author">Ellen P. Allerton</p>

<p class="verse">Beautiful faces are those that wear&#8212;<br />It matters little if dark or fair&#8212;<br />Whole-souled honesty printed there.</p>

<p class="verse">Beautiful eyes are those that show,<br />Like crystal panes where hearthfires glow,<br />Beautiful thoughts that burn below.</p>

<p class="verse">Beautiful lips are those whose words<br />Leap from the heart like songs of birds,<br />Yet whose utterance prudence girds.</p>

<p class="verse">Beautiful hands are those that do<br />Work that is earnest and brave and true,<br />Moment by moment the long day through.</p>

<p class="verse">Beautiful feet are those that go<br />On kindly ministries to a fro,<br />Down lowliest way, if God wills it so.</p>

<p class="verse">Beautiful shoulders are those that bear<br />Ceaseless burdens of homely care<br />With patient grace and daily prayer.</p>

<p class="verse">Beautiful lives are those that bless&#8212;<br />Silent rivers of happiness,<br />Whose hidden fountains but few may guess.</p>

<p class="verse">Beautiful twilight at set of sun,<br />Beautiful goal with race well won,<br />Beautiful rest with work well done.</p>

<p class="verse">Beautiful graves where grasses creep,<br />Where brown leaves fall, where drifts lie deep<br />Over worn-out hands&#8212;oh! beautiful sleep!</p>

<h1>Amusements</h1>

<p class="author">Charles E. Orr</p>

<p>Perhaps more souls have been allured away from right paths by present-day amusements than in any other. There is such a thing as getting such love for God, His Word, and communion with Him that we care but little for any other way in which to spend our time.</p>

<p>We willingly admit that there are some recreations and amusements that are harmless and innocent in themselves, but we should have a care lest there be an overindulgence in, and fondness for them. A young lady, speaking of a certain amusement, said. &#8220;I am passionately fond of it.&#8221; Such is too great a fondness. We should be passionately fond of nothing but God and matters that pertain to His worship and service. No one can have a passionate fondness for any amusement and keep the passion of Christ in his soul.</p>

<p>We cannot name to you just what amusements are innocent and what are not. Circumstances and conditions have much to do with it. I would advise, however, never to attend anything where the rabble of the world are gathered. You are to learn some things from God yourself. Live much in prayer, whenever you find that any amusement in which you may have some participation betimes is lessoning your relish for secret prayer and reading of the Bible, then cease to have any part in such recreation.</p>

<h1>Casting Down the Strongholds of Pride</h1>

<h2 class="subtitle">Ten Tips to Casting out Pride</h2>
<p class="author">Laura Erickson</p>

<p>I first wrote up this list for my own benefit, yet it seemed a good thing to share with others, and being encouraged thus, along with feeling a blessing in it, I have agreed to do so.</p>

<p>Pride seems to be a trap many/all into; or maybe I should say a castle the devil tries to build in many lives. God&#8217;s Word teaches us to be humble, as we read in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+4%3A6">James 4:6</a>:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;God resisteth the proud but giveth grace to the humble.&#8221;</span>
A proud spirit shows itself in many ways: self righteousness, judging others, family pride, excuses, and in blaming others. This is a stronghold that needs to be cast down.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds,) Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+10%3A4-5" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 10:4-5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 10:4-5)</span></a></span>
The weapons of our warfare are listed in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+6">Ephesians 6</a>:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+6%3A10-18" title="Ephesians 6:10-18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 6:10-18)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>I have endeavored, by God&#8217;s help, to make a little list of truths to &#8220;gird on&#8221; along with
<span class="scripture">&#8220;the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God,&#8221;</span>
that we might bring every high thing in subjection to Jesus. I pray that this might be a help and blessing to you, dear fellow-pilgrims, as we cast down strongholds and conquer the promised land.</p>

<h1>Keep Thyself Pure</h1>

<p class="author">Charles E. Orr</p>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first"><span class="scripture">&#8220;Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+5%3A8" title="Matthew 5:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 5:8)</span></a></span></p>
</div>


<p>This is our earnest word of exhortation to you, young women. We can make no higher appeal than this. Purity is the highest attainment in life. Who can know the worth of purity? We can know something of its worth by what it cost. It cost the life-blood of the Son of God. That blood is the fount of purity. The pure soul knows more of the real worth of things than any philosopher can through his philosophy. The pure sees the true worth where true worth belongs. It is only when the eye is single that the body is full of light. It is only when the soul is pure that vision is clear to see things as they are. Moral purity is the sole condition of clear spiritual vision. True beauty is hidden from the sensual. Sensuality blurs and befogs the glass through which the soul should look at the worthwhile things. What transparency is in the crystal, that is purity is in character. The man of science scans the face of the sky and sees the distant star. The pure in heart look into the face of Jesus and behold the bright and morning star. Man through his own wisdom may know much about the works of God, but it is only the pure that know God. Things reveal themselves only to things of like nature. God, being pure, can reveal Himself only to the pure. Man may invent machines whereby he can hear his fellows speaking across the continent, or hear the song of the growing grass; he may gather pearls from the bottom of the sea, he may be able to explain the moon&#8217;s control of the tides, he may be able to analyze the various stratas of the earth, he may count the stars, he may weigh the sun, he may be able to tell you the distance to Arcturus, but if he does not have a pure heart, he cannot know God.</p>

<p>Not philosophic minds, but <i>pure lives</i> are the world&#8217;s best teachers. The poor widow in her mountain cabin who has God in her soul can tell you more about the best things of life than the president of a theological seminary who does not have God. The pure life is the guiding star that leads the way to the worthwhile things of life. Men may teach you much about the mysteries of light, of sound, of electricity, or radio, but it is only the pure that can unfold the mysteries of God&#8217;s wonderful economy of grace. Give me the girl whose life is pure though she be one of earth&#8217;s most ignorant, that I may follow her instead of the girl who can exhaust the dictionary in the use of words in lecturing upon the ape theory of the origin of man, or the girl who surpasses the oratory of Cicero in denying the virgin birth of Christ.</p>

<p>There was an old colored woodsawer who knew no grammar; never saw inside a school room; who could not write his name; could not write a word. But when he prayed you felt that if you had put out your hand you would touch God. Give me such a man for a teacher. An hour in his presence is worth days in the presence of the worldly wise. It is only those who are like God that can see and know Him. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+5%3A8" title="Matthew 5:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 5:8)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Young women, I exhort you to associate with the pure. Shun the association of the impure. Just a little time spent in the presence of the vile and you will lose the clear vision of the delicacy of purity. A few moments contact with the ungodly will haze the mind until it will find it difficult to think the thoughts of God. A good man said, &#8220;I would give ten years of my life if I could forget the pictures which one year of my youthful days spent in impure doing has hung in my memory.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Keep thyself pure.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+5%3A22" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 5:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 5:22)</span></a></span> Keep your thoughts pure. The indulgence of impure thoughts foul the very spring of life. A few impure imaginations dim the mind to that which is pure and beautiful. You cannot have a high standard of thought and nobleness of life if you indulge in vain imaginations. If evil images are tolerated in the silent halls of your imaginations, you will not see the realities and the beauties of worthy things.</p>
