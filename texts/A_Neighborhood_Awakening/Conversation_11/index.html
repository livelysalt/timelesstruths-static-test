<h1>Conversation 11</h1>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;Well, I have come over this morning, Mr. Wright, to hear the reading of that letter you spoke about.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Very well, I will get it and read it to you with pleasure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noindent first">Dear Brother in Christ:</p>

<p>May the Lord bless you. Your manuscript of forty pages received denying that a person who has been born of God may fall. I will not have time to discuss all the points you mention, but will call your attention to a few scriptures which you have surely misinterpreted. I will also present a number of texts which you have passed over in silence and which place the entire subject in a different light.</p>

<p>You make mention of the visit of Nicodemus to Christ. Nicodemus did not understand how a person could enter into his mother&#8217;s womb and be born again. The fact of the case is, he had not yet accepted Christ and had not received a change of heart&#8212;conversion. The new birth was just as mysterious to him as it is to you.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;I do not like such insinuations. His words imply that the &#8220;new birth&#8221; is mysterious to that brother for the same reason that it was mysterious to Nicodemus, because he had not been converted. I am not going to stay to hear such ridicule.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;It may sound much worse to you than this writer intended. I think his writing is mild and kind. Let us keep cool and hear the end.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">You do not seem to understand what is meant when Jesus said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+3%3A6" title="John 3:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 3:6)</span></a></span> He meant to say, &#8220;Nicodemus, when you were born into this world, it was a birth of the flesh; but what I am trying to get you to understand now is that you must be born again, that is, you must have a spiritual birth by faith in Jesus Christ.&#8221;</p>

<p>You do not believe that a man can lose his soul after he has been once enlightened, and yet I notice you became very much confused on the subject when you undertook to explain <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+6%3A4-6">Hebrews 6:4-6</a>. I will give a clear explanation of this text before concluding this letter.</p>

<p>According to your own letter, God&#8217;s purpose in the redemptive plan was to restore to man what he lost through Adam&#8217;s fall. What was lost through Adam? And why was it lost? Adam was created pure and holy&#8212;in the image and likeness of God. Coming directly from the hand of the holy Creator, there could be no spot of sin in him. But he afterwards fell, as you admit. This fact proves positively that Adam&#8217;s state was a probational one: that the maintenance of holiness was, on his part, wholly conditional.</p>

<p>Redemption through Christ simply restores man to this original state of <span class="scripture">&#8220;righteousness and true holiness&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+4%3A24" title="Ephesians 4:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 4:24)</span></a></span>; but being still on probation, there is the same liability of his failing away. And this agrees with the teaching of the New Testament. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+10%3A12" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 10:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 10:12)</span></a></span> Judas failed to retain his integrity, therefore we read that <span class="scripture">&#8220;Judas by transgression fell.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+1%3A25" title="Acts 1:25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 1:25)</span></a></span> Peter teaches that it is possible for Christians to fall away, with the result that <span class="scripture">&#8220;the latter end is worse with them than the beginning&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+2%3A20" title="II&nbsp;Peter 2:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 2:20)</span></a></span>; while Jesus Himself admonishes the backsliders in the church, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+2%3A5" title="Revelation 2:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 2:5)</span></a></span></p>

</blockquote>


<p>Now, I need not read the remainder of the letter, except the conclusion, as in meaning, it is the same as Friend Truman and I explained in our talk the other day, both on the interpretation of <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+6%3A4-6">Hebrews 6:4-6</a> and <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+1">II&nbsp;Peter 1</a>. I do not understand how anyone can fail to see at once that Peter does not at all teach that one cannot fall, but does teach to the contrary. I will read you a few words this brother says on this point:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">He [Peter] tells them that if they do those things and abound they shall never fall; as much as to say that if they do not do those things, they will fall.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Then the conclusion of the letter reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Now, I would advise you to consider this matter carefully and be sure that you are willing to accept the plain teaching of the Scripture.</p>

<p>Trusting you will receive this in the spirit in which it is given, I remain,</p>

<p class="signature">Yours in Him,<br />&#8212;&#8212;</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Let me say kindly, but candidly, that there is not a single text in the Bible to support your doctrine; neither does reason stand on your side. To say that a man who has been converted, or born again, can sin the same as a sinner who has not been born again and that he can go to heaven but the sinner cannot, is contrary to the Scriptures, to justice, and to reason. Will you please give me one text that teaches the impossibility of falling from grace?</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;I admit that I cannot refer you to a text that says as much in plain words, but surely such is implied in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+3%3A9">I&nbsp;John 3:9</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Read the text please.</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>When a person is born again, there is a seed of the kingdom of heaven planted in the heart; and as this text says, that seed <span class="scripture">&#8220;remaineth in him&#8221;</span>; notwithstanding how deep he may go in sin in after years, that seed is always in his heart! And in God&#8217;s own way and time, he will be accepted into the everlasting kingdom above.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Perhaps you did not notice how your words contradicted the words of the text you read. The text you read says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;For his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.&#8221;</span> Now, according to the text, if this seed remains in him he cannot sin, but you said, &#8220;notwithstanding how deep he may go in sin in after years, that seed is always in his heart.&#8221; You say something directly contrary to what the text says.</p>

<p>I never saw a person who believed in the doctrine of &#8220;once in grace always in grace&#8221; but who also testified that he committed sin more or less. Do you live without committing sin?</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;I do not know that anyone has a right to be inquiring into my manner of life. As a rule, I keep myself to myself. Suppose I should ask you such question?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I am sure I should give you a kind, respectful answer. I believe that the God who saves us from sin is able to keep us from sin if we trust in Him; but to say that we could not sin if we desired to; or if we did sin, we were still saved is, I say, contrary to the Bible.</p>

<p>The apostle Peter tells us that the seed planted in the heart of those who are born again is the word of God. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible [seed] by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+1%3A23" title="I&nbsp;Peter 1:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 1:23)</span></a></span> The word of God is the seed. If we keep the word in our hearts, we shall not sin; in the very nature of things, we cannot sin. Out of the heart are the issues of life. Man will live out what is in his heart. If he has the word of God in his heart, he will live out the word of God. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin against thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+119%3A11" title="Psalm 119:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 119:11)</span></a></span> To say that the word of God cannot be lost out of the heart after once being sown in it, is contrary to the parable of the Sower (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+4%3A15">Mark 4:15</a>). Ah, my friend, the text you read does not teach the impossibility of falling from grace, but the secret of holy living.</p>

<p>Just another word, while I am speaking: The apostle says to Christians, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+5%3A8" title="I&nbsp;Peter 5:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 5:8)</span></a></span> If we who have been born again are not vigilant&#8212;watchful&#8212;the devil will devour us. That is why Christ says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+14%3A38" title="Mark 14:38"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 14:38)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;Well, I know I am all right. I may do a good many things now that are not what they should be, but I will get to heaven just the same.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;The Bible says that all liars <span class="scripture">&#8220;shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+21%3A8" title="Revelation 21:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 21:8)</span></a></span> The man who tells falsehoods after he has been born again will have to take his place with the man that tells falsehoods who never has been born again.</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;It is my business only if I tell lies, if I am clever enough to keep them covered so they will not be discovered.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;You seem to forget those solemn words of truth: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Be sure your sin will find you out.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Numbers+32%3A23" title="Numbers 32:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Numbers 32:23)</span></a></span> All sins prosper under cover until they become so multiplied and thrifty they can no longer be hid. <span class="scripture">&#8220;He that covereth his sins shall not prosper,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+28%3A13" title="Proverbs 28:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 28:13)</span></a></span> but the sins will prosper because they, under cover, are in their element.</p>

<p>Let me tell you the story of the Irishman. It is a little humorous, yet I tell it not for the humor&#8217;s sake but for the solemn truth it contains.</p>

<p>A lady who had an Irishman working for her asked him one day to catch a mole in her garden. After three days&#8217; digging, he succeeded in catching it, whereupon, addressing the little creature, he said, &#8220;Ye nasty varmint; you have caused me so much sweat o&#8217; mine brow, I will bury ye alive.&#8221; Accordingly, he took it and buried it in the earth&#8212;in its own element. So when you cover sins, you are putting them in their own element, and they will work your ruin.</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;I do not intend for any man to teach me. I am expecting to paddle my own canoe. So I will bid you good day.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;If we have not agreed on the Scriptures, this will not prevent our being friends, so if at any time I can be of any service to you in any way, I wish you would call on me. Goodbye.</p>

<p>(Mr. Cicure leaves.)</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Now, Mr. Wright, I want you to have patience with me. There is one more man whom I want you to talk with. He has not lived in our neighborhood very long, but I am sure he is a fine man and will make a good neighbor. He says he doesn&#8217;t believe we can live without sinning more or less, and he thinks the Scriptures teach that we shall sin as long as we are in this life.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I shall be pleased to have you bring him over at your convenience. And now, Mr. Truman, I am praying much for you. Why postpone the matter of salvation any longer? Why not get saved today?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I suppose I should, in fact, I know I should; I am growing more restless each day, but it seems that Satan in some way hinders me. I suppose I should not have waited so long as I have, but I tell you I was confused. There were so many saying this way is salvation and that way is salvation that I did not know what to do. The confusion is clearing away from my mind, little by little, so keep on praying for me. Your prayers will not be in vain.</p>
