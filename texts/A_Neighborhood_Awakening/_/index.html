<h1>Conversation 1</h1>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Good morning, Neighbor Wright. How are you and all yours this morning?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;We are all well, thank you; come in. And who is this gentleman with you?</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;This is my good friend and neighbor, Mr. Truman, with whom I wish you to get acquainted, Mr. Wright.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I have heard Mr. Truman spoken of frequently by different ones, but I have never had the pleasure of meeting him before.</p>

<p>I am glad to make your acquaintance.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;For a long time, I have been wanting to meet you and to have a talk with you.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;I have been talking with Mr. Truman upon the subject in which he, and I am sure all of us, are interested; but I cannot get him to understand my position. It is upon the subject of salvation that we have been talking. I have heard that you were a very ardent Christian and that you found great enjoyment in talking of the things of God, so we have come to hear what you have to say about salvation. All Christians believe in the salvation of mankind, but I find they differ greatly as to the time and manner of being saved.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;The Bible is very plain upon this subject; and I am sure there would not be such difference if all studied the Word with unbiased minds. I am heartily glad that you have come to talk upon the subject. It is a theme very dear to me. Is our friend Mr. Truman a Christian?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I have never made a profession of Christianity; however, I have for years had a desire to be right with God, and as time goes on, that desire grows stronger. Sometimes I think, &#8220;O God, I must be saved&#8221;; but I have seen so much disagreement between religious professors that I am sometimes made to wonder what is the right way. To my mind, it is impossible for all to be right when there is so much difference. If there is a right way&#8212;and I <i>must</i>, I <i>will</i>, believe there is&#8212;I want to find it. It is terrible to be lost; it must be glorious to be saved. But I am told by some that we are saved by works, by others that we are saved by baptism, and by others that we cannot be saved in this life. So I do not know how to get saved or whether I can get saved at all before I die. If I cannot get saved until after death, then I pray that that messenger will soon come for me. Oh, tell me, Mr. Wright, can I not get saved now? And if so, tell me how to be saved.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Have no fears, Mr. Truman; God will always be found of them that seek Him with all their hearts. He will never let a hungry soul go unfed. You can be saved; you can be saved now, and you can and will know when you get saved.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Allow me to differ with you here, Brother Wright. I believe we are saved by good works and that we do not know just when we are saved; but as we continue to serve the Lord, He will accept us.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;This is what Mr. Works has been talking to me, and I must admit that he has given me some very pointed texts of Scripture; yet my heart is not satisfied. It has always seemed to me that if heaven is the happy place the Bible says it is, if it will be forever, and if hell is the awful place without end that we are told it is, we should know when we are saved and ready for heaven. Can anything else satisfy my soul?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;There is a way that is right, an only way; we can find that way, thank the Lord, and know when we have found it.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;To think that we are right and that all others who do not see as we see are wrong is, I think, entirely too narrow. If we believe a way to be right, that way to us is right. Now I believe in salvation by good works.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;It is not, Friend Works, that I believe others to be wrong because they do not see as <i>I</i> see, but all are wrong who do not understand or see the Bible in its true meaning. Will you please explain what you mean by salvation by works?</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Since the Bible is so explicit on this subject, I am a little surprised that I should need to explain, however, I will. God will accept and own us as His if we live right. If I pay my debts as I can, give just weight and measure, visit the sick, give to the poor, and take in the stranger, I tell you I will risk being saved in eternity. Why men! Doesn&#8217;t Jesus say that if we do these things, He will say to us: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+25%3A34" title="Matthew 25:34"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 25:34)</span></a></span>?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;But, Mr. Works, let us reason a moment. Some words have more than one meaning. There is a difference (allow the homely illustration) between the tailor&#8217;s goose and the farmer&#8217;s domestic fowl called a goose. Another illustration: Two men who had never before seen an orange were each given one. One of them began to bite into his as one would eat an apple, while the other, before eating his, carefully removed the rind. The first said, &#8220;The orange is a bitter fruit&#8221;; the latter said, &#8220;It is most deliciously sweet.&#8221; They both were right. Now let us get at the true meaning, or meanings, of salvation. I admit that there is a salvation by works, but we must be careful to give to &#8220;salvation by works&#8221; its true meaning. To say that salvation by works <i>makes</i> us a child of God&#8212;that it effects the writing of our name in the book of life, and fits us for heaven&#8212;is using the term out of its true meaning, which is a dangerous thing to do. The salvation that the Bible speaks mostly about is not a salvation by works. Let us take one text for example. Here is my Bible, Mr. Works; read <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+2%3A4-5">Ephesians 2:4-5</a> for us.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Let me see, Ephesians is in the New Testament, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Yes, sir; it comes just after Galatians. There, just a few leaves further over.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;You say second chapter&#8230;&#8203;<span class="scripture">&#8220;But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved).&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;This fifth verse says that we were dead in sins. You will admit that we all were once sinners.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;And as sinners, we were in a state of spiritual death.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Now, what is meant by <span class="scripture">&#8220;quickened&#8221;</span> in verse 5 and also in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+2%3A1">verse 1</a>?</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;It means to make alive.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Then you will admit that before we are Christians we are in a state of death, and when we get saved, or become Christians, we are made alive?</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Well, I cannot deny that.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;How can a good work that we can do bring a dead soul into life?</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;I am not supposed to answer all questions, but I know that salvation is by works.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;You will agree with me that all men naturally are sinners.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Well, now read <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+1%3A15">I&nbsp;Timothy 1:15</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Let me see&#8230;&#8203;1 Timothy 1:15 you say. Since my eyes have been failing, I have not done much reading and I have forgotten where some of these books are. Now I have it; verse 15: <span class="scripture">&#8220;This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Christ came to save sinners. Now read <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+1%3A21">Matthew 1:21</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;It is Jesus that saves; He saved from sin. Now please read <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+7%3A48">Luke 7:48</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;I will let Mr. Truman do the reading; his eyes are better than mine.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;But I want you to look on as Mr. Truman reads. I think it will be the more convincing to you.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;I think it is a waste of time to be trying to convince me, for since I have belonged to church as long as I have and tried to live right, I <i>know</i> I am a Christian.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Pardon me, Friend Works, but did you not tell me the other day that we could not know just when we became Christians?</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Well now, what puzzles me is that if we cannot know when we become Christians, how can we know that we have become Christians at all? But I will read the text Mr. Wright called for&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;You will agree with me again, Brother Works, that when this woman&#8217;s sins were forgiven, she was saved, or in other words, became a Christian.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Well, yes, I am compelled to do that.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;What good works was it that she did that saved her?</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;I do not know; it may have been the wiping of his feet with her hair; at any rate it was not by faith as you claim that it was.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Please read verse 50, Mr. Works.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+7%3A50" title="Luke 7:50"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 7:50)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Here we see it was not the wiping of her Savior&#8217;s feet with her hair, but her faith in Him that saved her and gave her peace. Can you tell me what good work or number of good works that you did that made you a Christian?</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;I decided to live a better life; I left off my worst sins; I went to doing good; I took upon me the duties and profession of a Christian.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Do you believe that that saved you from all sin?</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;As to being saved from all sin, we all have our own private views.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Let us be serious now. You believe heaven to be a pure place?</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Certainly I do.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Do you believe that heaven&#8217;s purity would be marred in the least if the Lord were to take you to heaven just as you now are?</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;I think, Brother Wright, that to spare ourselves any uneasiness, we shall not entertain such serious thoughts.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;It is not, my dear friend, that I want to cause you any uneasiness, but heaven is real, and it is a holy and happy place; hell is also real, and a place of the greatest wretchedness. Since we are hastening on to the one or the other of these places, it is time that we be serious. You say that the salvation you have is just what you have grown into by good works. Now, what has such a salvation done for you? What kind of a person has it made you to be? Are you ready to walk the golden streets of the New Jerusalem with those who have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb? Could you join in with that white-robed throng in singing the song of Moses and the Lamb? Could you sit beneath the tree of life with our Savior in perfect calmness? Could you sit upon the evergreen banks of the river of life and look into the rippling water with the consciousness that your soul is as pure as that crystal stream? If everyone in heaven were as you now are, what kind of a place do you think heaven would be?</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;I say I do not think such pointed questions should be asked. I shall not trouble myself with them. None of us can know just how it is with us, but we know that if we do the best we can, our kind, merciful Savior will not turn us away. But I have stayed as long as I can for this time. When I come again, I shall come with some scriptures that will convince you that my position is right. I will give you this one to think upon&#8212;&#8220;He that continueth in good works the same shall be saved.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I am very glad you gentlemen came over today. I have enjoyed the talk ever so much.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;It has certainly encouraged my heart.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;While it is our duty to point out to our kind friends the true Bible way, we do so in love and with the kindest of feeling. I shall be pleased to have you bring your scriptures, Brother Works, and we shall consider them in the spirit of friendship. While you are collecting your list of texts, please get the chapter and verse of the text you just quoted.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I saw you with a paper in your hand, Mr. Wright, when we came this morning. Was it a religious paper?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Yes, sir; it is the <i>Gospel Trumpet</i>, published at Anderson, Indiana. There are articles in it upon all religious subjects from time to time. Its teachings are clear and plain. It is just such a paper as you should read.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;What is the subscription price?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;One dollar a year.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;You may send it to me.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Thank you. Now, come again soon, both of you. Goodbye.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;I will be over as soon as I can get my scriptures collected. Goodbye.</p>

<h1>Conversation 2</h1>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Well, here we are again, Neighbor Wright. I am full of confidence this morning. I am pretty sure the Scriptural texts I have collected will convince you that salvation is by works.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I am much pleased to have you come. I am sure we shall have a good, friendly time considering the Word of God on this subject. Remember, Brother Works, that I admit that there is a salvation by works.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;I hold that there is no other salvation than that by works. The sinner simply decides that he will live a better life; he goes to leaving off his worst sins and goes to doing good, unites with some church, and takes upon himself the duties and profession of a Christian. I think a man should reform his life to a considerable degree before he takes upon himself the profession of Christianity.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;You have already admitted that it is sinners who need to be saved?</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Yes, sir; but it is by works that they are saved.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;At any rate, it is the sinner that needs to be saved. Jesus said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+5%3A31" title="Luke 5:31"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 5:31)</span></a></span> According to your plan, a very sick man is not worthy of the attention of a physician, but he should improve himself before he calls for medical aid. Christ will save the vilest sinner. He does not ask for a reformation on the part of the sinner, but only repentance. When a sinner comes in all the vileness of his sins, but penitently, to Christ and believes His promise to save, that act of faith will secure the pardon of Christ, who will wash all his sins away, making him fit to be taken right into heaven.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;I tell you I do not believe in those miraculous conversions we sometimes hear about. The Scriptures say we &#8220;grow into grace.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Let us open our Bibles to <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+23">Luke 23</a>. Here we read of the crucifixion of our blessed Savior. Verse 33 tells us that two malefactors&#8212;persons guilty of crime&#8212;were led with Him to be put to death. Reading from verse 39, we learn that one was impenitent, railing on Jesus. The other feared God, became penitent, and said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+23%3A42" title="Luke 23:42"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 23:42)</span></a></span> Jesus said to him, <span class="scripture">&#8220;To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+23%3A43" title="Luke 23:43"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 23:43)</span></a></span> A man whose soul was stained with the sin of crime became penitent and called on the Lord, and Jesus taking all his sins away, made him fit to be taken with Jesus Himself into paradise. To be a Christian is to be saved from all sin by an act of faith, and with such an experience, we are ready for heaven. If we are not this moment pure enough to be taken into heaven without marring the purity of that place, we should not, were we this moment to die, be taken to heaven at all. Salvation by grace through faith will make us that pure; and when we get such an experience, we shall <i>know</i> it.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Thank God, that sounds good to me. My heart hungers for just such an experience.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Allow me to correct you, Neighbor Works, in your quotation a short while ago. Open your Bible to <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+3%3A18">II&nbsp;Peter 3:18</a>. There we read, <span class="scripture">&#8220;But grow in grace.&#8221;</span> The Bible nowhere says, &#8220;grow <i>into</i> grace&#8221;; we are to <span class="scripture">&#8220;grow <i>in</i> grace&#8221;</span>&#8212;<i>after</i> we get into grace. Now, here is the truth: good works will keep us growing in grace, but they will never grow us into grace. The only salvation that is by works is after we have been saved by grace (and thus we get into grace); we keep saved, or keep in grace, by good works, living in obedience to all of God&#8217;s Word. This is the only salvation by works taught in the Scriptures.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I believe with all my heart that that is the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;But the Bible says plainly, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+2%3A12+" title="Philippians 2:12 "><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 2:12 )</span></a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Certainly enough we must, but not before we are saved. We must live carefully, resist all temptation to do evil, fear to disobey God&#8217;s Word. It is in this sense we work out our salvation. We live so that we keep saved. Let me illustrate this to you. A father has a boy who has fallen into the stream and is drowning. There is nothing he can do to save himself; his efforts are all in vain. He calls to his father. The father hears and comes to the rescue. He saves his boy. He now forbids the boy to go near the stream again. The boy keeps saved, works out his salvation by obeying his father. This is the only salvation by works the Bible mentions.</p>

<p>We will take the case of Adam and Eve. God made them and gave them life. They had not one single act in the matter. God told them what they should do and what they should not do. If they had obeyed, they would have kept the life God gave them; but they disobeyed, and died. Now, they could have worked out their eternal life by obedience. They had nothing to do in the giving of life to themselves, but they had something to do to keep it.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;This is very simple and plain. Can&#8217;t you see it, Mr. Works?</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Our church teaches salvation by works, and I know that there are any good faithful Christians among us.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Let us read you <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+2%3A10">Ephesians 2:10</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8220;For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works.&#8221;</span> The Christian is <i>God&#8217;s</i> workmanship; not his own. It is only when he has been created in Christ that he can do the good works that God accepts. An infidel may do good, but his good works give him no place in the kingdom of God. I will read you a text from Paul&#8217;s letter to Titus that is very positive: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+3%3A5" title="Titus 3:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Titus 3:5)</span></a></span> Here it is plainly stated that it is not by doing right, or good works, that we are saved. How can you harmonize this text with your theory of salvation by works?</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Well, there are different texts in the Scriptures that are difficult to make harmonize. I know there are some that teach salvation by works.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I know that there is, and if you would give the application to them that I have given, they would harmonize with this text I have just read you. One of the men who ate an orange said the fruit is bitter; the other said it is sweet. They were both right; but had one said that it is bitter, and always bitter, he would have been wrong. You are right when you say there is a salvation by works, but when you say that salvation by works is the only salvation&#8212;that which makes us Christians, liberates from sin, makes us children of God&#8212;you make a mistake and find yourself in opposition to many plain texts of Scripture. Now, if you can get to see that salvation which keeps from sin&#8212;not the salvation that makes us new creatures in Christ, but only the salvation by which we humbly keep God&#8217;s commandments after we are saved by grace&#8212;then you would see the beautiful harmony of the Bible.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Let me give you a text or two of Scripture; I have not given you the texts I hunted up. Here is one from James that will forever settle the question: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Was not Abraham our father justified by works?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+2%3A21" title="James 2:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 2:21)</span></a></span> Now harmonize your texts with this, will you? Then again, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+2%3A25" title="James 2:25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 2:25)</span></a></span> Here is another: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Ye see then how that by works a man is justified.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+2%3A24" title="James 2:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 2:24)</span></a></span> How these texts settle the question. It is by works that a man is justified. You thought I did not know anything about the Bible, but I tell you I know a thing or two. But I must be going now. I will leave these texts for your consideration until I come again. I hope Mr. Truman will also consider them.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I must confess I do not understand these texts. It looks plain that a man is justified by works, yet the text Mr. Wright read says we are not saved by works of righteousness. The texts given by you, Mr. Works, halfway convince my head but they do not satisfy my heart.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;The Scriptures in no wise conflict when rightly interpreted. I will gladly explain these texts to you now, Mr. Works, if you have time to stay awhile.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;I have stayed over time now, so I shall have to go. When I come again, I shall give you even more positive texts than these. Goodbye.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Be sure to come again; I enjoy these talks very much. I am sure someone will have more light and be more responsible than they were before. By the way, Mr. Truman, did you read the paper I let you have?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I have read every word of it.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;How do you like it?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;It is the best paper I have ever read. I see in it a book advertised; I think it is <i>What Shall I Do to Be Saved?</i> I should like to have that book.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Yes, you ought to have that book. There are some things for a sinner to do to get saved. This book tells you all about it. Maybe I have one in my library. If I have, I will let you read it; and if I have not, we can get it. Goodbye, gentlemen. Come again.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Yes, I want to hear those texts explained. We shall come tomorrow if Mr. Works can come.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;I will see.</p>

<h1>Conversation 3</h1>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;How are you, Neighbor Wright, this pleasant morning?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I am well, thank the Lord, and saved by the grace of God through faith. And how are you both, Mr. Works and Mr. Truman?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I am quite well, thank you; but I cannot say that I am saved. However, if I should base salvation on the same conditions as Neighbor Works here does, I believe I could say as truly as he that I am saved.</p>

<p>On the way over here this morning, he was telling me why he believed he was a Christian. He said that he was careful to keep all his promises to his neighbors, that he paid all his debts as promptly as possible, that he helped the poor as much as he well could, that he visited the sick, that in the selling of a horse or a cow, he was careful not to misrepresent it, and that when selling grain, he always heaped up the half-bushel, etc. He also said that he was a member of the church and gave to the preacher and to missionary work.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;I certainly cannot believe that our kind heavenly Father will permit a man to be lost who lives as I told Mr. Truman that I live.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Just as Friend Works says he lives, so do I live, only I am not a member of any church, and he admits that joining church will not save anyone. I live as he says he does and yet I cannot feel that I am saved. I read in the Bible last night that <span class="scripture">&#8220;though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+13%3A3" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 13:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 13:3)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Well, I believe that I love God.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;It means much to love God as the Bible says we should. If we love God, we shall carefully obey all He says. Jesus, when talking to one of the Jewish rulers, said that <span class="scripture">&#8220;except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+3%3A3" title="John 3:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 3:3)</span></a></span> Then the Scriptures speak of being made <span class="scripture">&#8220;a new creature&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+5%3A17" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 5:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 5:17)</span></a></span> in Christ and of being <span class="scripture">&#8220;delivered us from the power of darkness, and&#8230;&#8203;translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+1%3A13" title="Colossians 1:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 1:13)</span></a></span> and of <span class="scripture">&#8220;[passing] from death unto life.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+5%3A24" title="John 5:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 5:24)</span></a></span> Now it does seem to me that such experiences must be instantly wrought and by some power outside of ourselves. But I must have a care lest I become teacher rather than learner. I am still puzzled, Mr. Wright, about those texts Neighbor Works quoted as we were leaving the other evening.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;It was the second chapter of James, I believe that he quoted: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Was not Abraham our father justified by works?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+2%3A21" title="James 2:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 2:21)</span></a></span> And <span class="scripture">&#8220;ye see then how that by works a man is justified.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+2%3A24" title="James 2:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 2:24)</span></a></span> He did not quote all those texts. The words, <span class="scripture">&#8220;and not by faith only,&#8221;</span> are added.</p>

<p>Remember, my friends, that I admit that there is a salvation by works. We are to <span class="scripture">&#8220;work out [our] salvation with fear and trembling.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+2%3A12" title="Philippians 2:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 2:12)</span></a></span> And, oh, I fear there is not near enough <span class="scripture">&#8220;fear and trembling&#8221;</span> in these days of cold formality. If we do not pay our debts when we can, if we do not give of our means as we can, if we do not visit the sick when we have opportunity, if we do not deal honestly and truthfully in our business-relations with men, we shall not be saved, for God commands us to do those things. To refuse or to neglect to do them is disobedience, and if we disobey, we cannot keep saved. But the doing of those things alone will not save us. There is sin upon the soul of every unregenerated man, and no good works that man can do will ever cleanse it away; yet, unless it is cleansed away, no man can enter the pearly gates of heaven.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;What were the works by which Abraham was justified?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;He simply obeyed God. He offered up Isaac as God told him to do. We must obey God or else we cannot stand justified in His sight. No man can get to heaven without doing good works, and yet the doing of good works does not save us.</p>

<p>The offering up of Isaac did not make Abraham a man of God; he was a man of God long before that act of obedience. There is a sense in which we as individuals are justified by works. If I do a good deed, God justifies me in the act. If we have faith in God, we shall prove it by our works. If a man believes in God, he will obey all he knows of the teachings of the New Testament. It is folly for a man to say he has faith in God when he will not obey God&#8217;s Word. This is all that is meant by the words of James.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Oh, I supposed you would have some way of explaining it.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I have merely given you the true meaning. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Faith,&#8221;</span> he says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;without works is dead.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+2%3A26" title="James 2:26"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 2:26)</span></a></span> Faith and works go together in the Christian life. We see too many people today who are not proving their faith by their works. They say they trust in God, that they love their neighbors, etc., but their life does not say so.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;That is certainly true.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;It is positively true that no amount of good works will ever bring us into spiritual life. Life can come only from some preexisting life. The life of Christ is brought into the soul of man by an act of faith, and in no other way. Let me quote you a text that fully explains the whole matter: <span class="scripture">&#8220;For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+2%3A8-10" title="Ephesians 2:8-10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 2:8-10)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Surely, Mr. Works, this text is plain and positive enough to convince you that salvation is not by good works.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Well, I believe I am a Christian. I have belonged to the church for years and have dealt uprightly with all men.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;We do not go to heaven because we have joined some church or because we give good weight and measure, but because we have believed on Jesus Christ. The text I just read to you says that we are saved by grace through faith. We can get our sins forgiven and get Christ into our hearts in no other way. It is, as you can plainly see by the text, by faith that we are saved from sin and by faith that we are created in Christ. A Christian is a new creature, as you can read in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+5%3A17">II&nbsp;Corinthians 5:17</a>. He is God&#8217;s workmanship and not a product of his own good deeds. There is no such thing as a self-made Christian. He is created in Christ by the Spirit of God, but remember, he is created unto good works. No good works can make a man a Christian, but after he is in Christ, he must do good works; he must obey all the Word of God or Christ will not abide in his heart.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Do you mean to say that there is not anything a man can do whereby he can help to save himself?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;There is positively nothing for a man to do that will save him or help to save him, but there is something for him to do in order for Christ to save him.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Now you are coming to the point. Please make that clear and plain to me.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I can make it plainest to you both by giving you an illustration. We will suppose a ship has sunk at sea. Its mast is projecting above the water. A man in the water is holding to the mast, but he is perishing. If he lets go of the mast when no one is at hand to save him, he will be lost. If he holds on to the mast, he is holding himself in the very element that is destroying him. Now a man comes to save him, but that man cannot save him so long as he is struggling and trying to save himself. He must cease his struggling&#8212;<i>he must give up</i>. Then, not only must he give up, but he must let go of the mast.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I believe I see the point. Don&#8217;t you see it, Mr. Works? It is beautiful.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;No, I do not see it; let&#8217;s hear Mr. Wright make the application.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;A sinner is in a lost state; he is perishing. He is holding on as best he can to himself, or to life. It is impossible for him to save himself. There is only One that can save him, and even He, Christ, cannot save him unless he will give up all. He must cease all efforts to save himself, and he must let go&#8212;let go of self, sin, and the world. So sure as he will come to the end of self, forsake all, throw himself helplessly into the arms of a loving, merciful Savior and believe, then the gloom of death, the wretchedness of darkness, will be driven out of his soul, and innocence, light, and life from heaven will come streaming in.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;And he will know he is saved?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Know it? Surely; when a sin-ladened soul finds rest in Christ, he will know it.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;It is just such an experience that my soul is longing for. I want rest. I want to know in my heart that I am the Lord&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;I am willing to take my chances. If I deal uprightly with all men, I do not believe God will suffer me to be lost. But I cannot stay longer today.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;We need not take chances. Let us do as Peter exhorted us&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;make [our] calling and election sure.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+1%3A10" title="II&nbsp;Peter 1:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 1:10)</span></a></span> We must be like Christ, in nature, when He calls for us or He cannot take us into heaven. There is nothing we can do that will make us like Christ, but when we believe the promises, we are made <span class="scripture">&#8220;partakers of the divine nature.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+1%3A4" title="II&nbsp;Peter 1:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 1:4)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;I am satisfied to go on in my way.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I could have taken my way long ago, but I want to find the Bible way.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Jesus says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;I am the way.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+14%3A6" title="John 14:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 14:6)</span></a></span> Taking Christ is the only way to heaven.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I heard Mr. Waters say that he was coming over to have a talk with you, Mr. Wright; I shall try to come with him. It is clear to me that salvation is not by works. Mr. Waters believes that baptism is a saving ordinance, and he certainly does give some very plain Scriptural proof.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I shall be pleased to have him and you come.</p>

<p>And you come again, Mr. Works. Goodbye.</p>

<h1>Conversation 4</h1>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;A pleasant spring morning, Mr. Wright.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Yes, sir, a beautiful morning; I am a lover of a fine morning like this.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;I think we all enjoy this spring morning after the very disagreeable weather we have been having. You are getting ready for gardening?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I am clearing away a little so as to be ready when the ground becomes in condition.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Well, Friend Truman and I came over to talk with you a while this morning if you have a few moments to spare.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I seldom get too busy to talk with my good neighbors. Let us go into the house.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I have been telling Friend Waters of your conversation with Mr. Works on the subject of salvation.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Mr. Works was telling me something about it. He said you were well versed in the Bible and that you rather got the better of him in the argument.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;It was not my being so well versed, but my having the truth that gave me the advantage.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;I do not altogether agree with Mr. Works myself. I believe in salvation by baptism, and I am fully able by the Scriptures to verify my position.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I myself belonged to a denomination at one time that believed that water washes away sins, but I found that after I was baptized, I went on sinning just as I did before.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Do you mean to say that you do not believe in salvation by baptism?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;No, sir, I have not said so; there is a salvation by water, but it is not that salvation that saves us from sin and makes us children of God. There are several salvations spoken of in the Bible. There is a salvation by works, a salvation by baptism, and a salvation by grace through faith.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Well, this is something new to me; I have never met anyone who believed in salvation by grace who would admit any salvation by baptism.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;The subject of salvation is very interesting and easy to understand when we rightly divide the Word of God. Salvation in one text may not mean what it does in another text. It is like the two men who went from the East to Texas. One upon his return said that Texas was a low, level, fertile, and warm country. The other said that Texas was rough and rocky, a desert waste. Now both of these men were right, or would have been, if each had limited his description to a certain portion of Texas; but when one attempted to apply his description to the whole state, he became wrong.</p>

<p>The same is true of salvation. It has more than one meaning, and whoever attempts to give it but one meaning becomes wrong and will find his position in opposition to many plain texts of Scripture.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;These are new thoughts to me, and I can see now where they will put you in advantage in an argument, but I am by no means yet ready to surrender my position.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Those who have the truth will always have the advantage in any Scriptural discussion.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;But there is a text which says that <span class="scripture">&#8220;baptism doth&#8230;&#8203;now save us.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A21" title="I&nbsp;Peter 3:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 3:21)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I know that there is, and that is why I say there is a salvation by baptism. But what is the nature of that salvation? Is it a salvation from sin? A salvation that makes us Christians? A salvation that adopts us into the family of God?</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;I think so, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Then, let me ask you to explain one text. Open your Bible to <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+16%3A30">Acts 16:30</a>. There a jailor addressed Paul and Silas saying, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Sirs, what must I do to be saved?&#8221;</span> Now, if salvation were by baptism and by baptism only, why did they not tell him to be baptized?</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;What did they tell him?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I will read it right from the Book. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+16%3A31" title="Acts 16:31"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 16:31)</span></a></span> You will have to admit that there is a salvation by faith in Christ, else this text stands directly opposed to you.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Let me read you the text where it says that baptism saves us. Let me see, where is it?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;You will find it in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A21">I&nbsp;Peter 3:21</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Yes, it says: <span class="scripture">&#8220;The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us.&#8221;</span> So you shall have to admit that there is a salvation by baptism.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I have already done so. Now in the light of God&#8217;s Word, let us consider the nature of the salvation by believing and the salvation by baptism. We shall consider first the salvation by faith. Will you please read <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+3%3A16">John 3:16</a>?</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Yes, sir: <span class="scripture">&#8220;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Believing on Jesus Christ will save us from perishing and will give us eternal life. Where is the text that says that much for water baptism? Please read the first part of verse 36.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+3%3A36" title="John 3:36"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 3:36)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Now read <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+5%3A1">I&nbsp;John 5:1</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Next, read <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+2%3A8">Ephesians 2:8</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;For by grace are ye saved through faith.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;One more text, please&#8212;<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+3%3A26">Galatians 3:26</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;We could go on reading texts similar to these for a long time, but these are sufficient to give us an understanding of the true nature of the salvation that is by faith. It saves us from perishing, gives us eternal life, effects the new birth, making us children of God.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Praise the Lord! Oh, may He help my unbelief!</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Now, let us consider the salvation that is by baptism. Turn to the text again, <span class="scripture">&#8220;The like figure whereunto even baptism doth now save us.&#8221;</span> Read the next words.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;Not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A21" title="I&nbsp;Peter 3:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 3:21)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;There we have the meaning of baptism. It is a figurative salvation. The salvation of Noah was typical, or in other words, a figure of our salvation by Christ Jesus. So baptism is a figure like unto it. In verse 20, we read that <span class="scripture">&#8220;eight souls were saved by water.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A20" title="I&nbsp;Peter 3:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 3:20)</span></a></span> Now it was not by the water, but by the ark they were saved; but in the salvation of Noah and his family there was water, and so it says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;saved by water,&#8221;</span> although the ark was the real means of salvation. Jesus is our salvation, and baptism is a figure of our salvation in Him. You see, in our hearts, we die to sin, to self, to the world. A death takes place in our inner being. Paul says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;I am crucified&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+2%3A20" title="Galatians 2:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 2:20)</span></a></span>; <span class="scripture">&#8220;For ye are dead&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+3%3A3" title="Colossians 3:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 3:3)</span></a></span>; <span class="scripture">&#8220;Being dead to sins&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+2%3A24" title="I&nbsp;Peter 2:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 2:24)</span></a></span>; <span class="scripture">&#8220;How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+6%3A2" title="Romans 6:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 6:2)</span></a></span> A resurrection then takes place in our souls; we are <span class="scripture">&#8220;born again&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+1%3A23" title="I&nbsp;Peter 1:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 1:23)</span></a></span>; we <span class="scripture">&#8220;[pass] from death unto life&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+5%3A24" title="John 5:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 5:24)</span></a></span>; we are <span class="scripture">&#8220;risen with Christ&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+3%3A1" title="Colossians 3:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 3:1)</span></a></span>; we are saved from sin and made new creatures in Christ. Now this is a work wrought in the soul all unseen by the human eye. Jesus has placed an ordinance in His church to represent to all men the real work wrought in the heart. Being buried in water signifies a death; being raised up signifies a resurrection. This work has been done in the soul, and baptism is a figurative salvation. A man repents of his sins, believes on the Lord Jesus Christ, is saved from his sins, by grace, and then is baptized. He is saved both in the real act of grace in his soul and by the figurative act of baptism.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;How beautifully the Word harmonize when we divide it rightly!</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;If this were the only text that speaks of salvation by baptism, I might think of surrendering my position, but there are others, and then just think what a strong church we have and what a body of learned ministers who teach that baptism is a saving ordinance; why, I would not think of believing anything else!</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Baptism is not a saving ordinance, but an ordinance figuratively representing salvation. Look at the large body of learned ministers in other denominations who do <i>not</i> believe as your body of learned ministers! So you see we cannot take what a body of learned ministers say, simply because they say it. Now, Mr. Waters, if God, in His plan of salvation had made baptism the means of salvation, then no one could be saved unless he were baptized. The thief on the cross went to heaven without being baptized; Jesus said to the woman who washed His feet with her tears, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Thy faith hath saved thee, go in peace.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+7%3A50" title="Luke 7:50"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 7:50)</span></a></span> He said nothing to her about baptism, and you, I do not think, are ready to say that a man cannot repent in his dying hour, believe on the Lord Jesus, and go to heaven without being baptized.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;There are exceptions to all rules.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;There is no exception to God&#8217;s plan of salvation by faith. No man who has been enlightened by the gospel can go to heaven without believing on Christ, but he can go without being baptized in water.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Of course, we all believe that we should believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;But to believe on Christ to the saving of the soul is more than an intellectual belief or assent. It is believing with the heart that the blood of Christ now cleanses the soul from all sin.</p>

<p>By the way, Mr. Truman, I have one of those books, <i>What Shall I Do to Be Saved?</i> You may take it. I am sure its instructions are according to the Bible.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Thank you, I shall surely read it.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;I am very glad I came over today. I am willing to admit that I have learned something. I do not mean by that, that I am being converted to your views, Brother Wright; I have been in this way too long for that.</p>

<p>Now, before I go, I want to give you just one text for you to think upon until I come again. It may be you have never read it; it is <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+22%3A16">Acts 22:16</a>. Ananias speaking to Paul said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Yes, I have read that text and have been expecting you to quote it before now. Let me give you for your consideration <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+1%3A5">Revelation 1:5</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;This is interesting to me. It appears to me as if you are in a tangle now.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I hope to have you both come again soon. In the meantime, let us ask God to teach us His way.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I shall come just as soon as I can get Mr. Waters to come.</p>

<h1>Conversation 5</h1>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Well, here we are, Neighbor Wright, ready to hear your comment on <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+22%3A16">Acts 22:16</a>. Mr. Works told me last evening that you would be sure to have some kind of explanation.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;The Bible is its own interpreter. When explanations are given that harmonize with all other texts of Scripture, we may rest assured that we have the Biblical interpretation. For example, there is a text which says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;There is none righteous, no not one.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+3%3A10" title="Romans 3:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 3:10)</span></a></span> Then, the Scriptures speaking of Zacharias and Elizabeth say, <span class="scripture">&#8220;And they were both righteous before God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+1%3A6" title="Luke 1:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 1:6)</span></a></span> If we let the Bible explain itself, there will be no confliction between these texts; but whenever a man applies <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+3%3A10">Romans 3:10</a> to all men, he puts his doctrine out of harmony with <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+1%3A6">Luke 1:6</a> and many other texts. For that reason, Romans 3:10 cannot be Scripturally applied to all men.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;This is pretty good; Mr. Waters made that very application of that text this morning while we were on our way over here.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Well, the Bible is a difficult book to understand anyway.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;No, my dear friend, not when it is rightly divided. You know that Paul said to Timothy: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+3%3A15" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 3:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 3:15)</span></a></span> If a school teacher were to acknowledge before his class that the arithmetic was a difficult book to understand and that he was unable to make its statements harmonize, he would feel much ashamed, don&#8217;t you think?</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Yes, sir; I. should think he would be in an embarrassing position.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Pardon me, but if a teacher of the Scriptures confesses that his textbook is difficult to understand and that he is unable to harmonize it, he has some need to be ashamed. Let me ask you a question: Do you not believe that a sinner must have his sins forgiven, or washed away, before he can become a Christian or get to the world of eternal rest?</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Certainly I believe that, and the text I gave you says that water washes away sins.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I admit that water washes away sins just as baptism saves and as the water saved Noah and his family. You have been baptized, have you not?</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Did the water wash away your sins?</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;It certainly did.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Have you sinned since you were baptized?</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Why of course I&#8212;but say, you are not explaining the text I gave you. Paul had his sins washed away. If baptism does not wash away sins, please explain that text.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I will explain it&#8212;but answer my question. Have you sinned since you were baptized?</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Let me give you another text that proves baptism to be a saving ordinance.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I want you to answer my question first. Have you sinned since you were baptized?</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;I see where you are trying to get me. Of course we all sin more or less perhaps every day, but God knows we are weak and merely human; and He does not regard the wrongs we do after we have been baptized, become members of His church, and have taken upon us the duties and profession of a Christian.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Pardon me again, but I must say that this must be some of the vain philosophy Paul wrote to Timothy about. Sin is always sin. Being baptized, my brother, or making a profession of Christianity does not change the nature of sin nor make it in the least degree less offensive to God.</p>

<p>But we have come to the explanation of the text. It requires but few words. It is the blood of Christ that washes sin from the soul as the text I quoted you in our last talk stated. Then, we read in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+7%3A14">Revelation 7:14</a>, <span class="scripture">&#8220;These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.&#8221;</span> The washing of the soul from sin is by the blood of Christ.</p>

<p>Before telling you what is meant by the words of your text, I should like to give you a Bible picture of the wonderful efficacy of the blood of Christ with the hope that you shall see it and appreciate it as you have not heretofore.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I wish you would. If you will allow me, Mr. Waters, I will tell what I heard one of your preachers say.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Be free to tell it. I feel that you brethren are speaking in the spirit of love, and I want to assure you that I will take no offense.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Thank you. What I am going to tell is almost too shocking to repeat. Speaking with reference to a present experience of soul-cleansing from sin, he said that there is no more power in the blood of Christ to cleanse sin from the soul than there is in the blood of cock robin.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;He was one of our preachers, and he believes that baptism is a representative act, which God accepts in the place of what the blood of Christ can do for the soul when it is separated from the body, or at death. He believes that the blood of Christ has no efficacy, really, until the judgment; that baptism is a kind of representative act, and that all who are baptized here in water are taken into God&#8217;s church because the blood will cleanse them at the judgment. Then, some of our preachers believe that Christ forgives sins only in the act of baptism.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;What do you believe?</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;To confess the truth to you, I hardly know.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Let me give you some of the Word of God. I will give a text that has already been quoted&#8212; <span class="scripture">&#8220;Unto him who loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+1%3A5" title="Revelation 1:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 1:5)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1%3A9" title="I&nbsp;John 1:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 1:9)</span></a></span> This cleansing is by the blood of Christ, as is explained in verse 7: <span class="scripture">&#8220;And the blood of Jesus Christ his Son, cleanseth us from all sin&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1%3A7" title="I&nbsp;John 1:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 1:7)</span></a></span>&#8212;not that it <i>will</i> cleanse us at the judgment, but it cleanses <i>now</i>. I will read you <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+2%3A22">Jeremiah 2:22</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8220;For though thou wash thee with niter, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord G<span class="KJVsc">OD</span>.&#8221;</span> Niter and <i>much</i> soap could not wash away the marks or stains of sin. Now, let us read <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+1%3A18">Isaiah 1:18</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Come now, let us reason together, saith the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>; though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="verse">The stains of sin had blackened my soul
<br />As black as the darkest night;
<br />But the blood of Christ pervaded the whole,
<br />Making it white as the light.</p>

<p>The blood of Christ can take away the scarlet and crimson stains of sin, while niter, much soap, and water baptism cannot do it.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;It is now twenty-seven years since I was baptized and joined the church. I am satisfied to go on the remainder of my days just as I have been going. It is of no use to tell me that all these good preachers and men and women we have among us are not going to heaven.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;It is not my business to say who is going to heaven and who is not. It is my business to teach the Word of God and then leave every man to settle his account with Him.</p>

<p>Christ says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+11%3A28" title="Matthew 11:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 11:28)</span></a></span> It is sin that brings guilt, condemnation, and unrest to the soul. Salvation by grace through faith removes sin from the soul and brings the rest that Christ has promised. The soul that is saved by grace has entered into rest&#8212;sweet, calm, blessed rest. Being baptized in water does not bring rest to the soul.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;I said that some of our preachers believed that Christ forgives us our sins in the act of baptism. If that be true, then we should find rest to our souls through Christ in the act of baptism.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Can you give me one text that even implies that Christ pardons a guilty soul, giving peace in the act of baptism? No; we do not receive forgiveness of sins through an act of baptism but through an act of faith, which does bring peace. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+5%3A1" title="Romans 5:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 5:1)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;I see that you are too well read in the Scriptures for me to contend with; but if I had some of our preachers here, they would soon put you in a corner.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;It is difficult to put truth into a corner. But I see you are preparing to go; I want you to come again. There are other texts I want to explain to you.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;There are a number of texts that I have heard our preachers use when preaching on salvation by baptism, but I cannot quote them, neither do I know where to find them. I will go over to our preacher&#8217;s and get him to find them for me, and then I will come again.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Mr. Truman, how are you getting along? Do you not want the soul rest that Christ promised to give?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I certainly do; I believe I am getting nearer the kingdom; I want to hear this talk a little further.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;God bless you.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Waters, I have not yet explained your text. It means that sins are washed away, but the water washes them away only in a figure. Paul&#8217;s sins had already been washed from his soul by the blood of Christ, and then he was to arise and have them washed away figuratively, as a testimony to the world of what the blood of the Lamb had wrought in his once sin-stained soul.</p>

<p>Come again, both of you. Good evening.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/A_Neighborhood_Awakening/Conversation_6/index.html">Conversation 6</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Conversation 6</h1>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I am getting very eager to get saved, Mr. Wright, so I prevailed on Mr. Waters to come over this morning that I might hear the remainder of this discussion and know the way of salvation more perfectly.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I am pleased to have you both come, and may the Lord give us a friendly and profitable talk.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;I am not feeling well this morning, therefore do not care to stay long, so we shall come to the point at once. I have a few Scriptures that I think will convince you, if truth can convince you, that salvation is by baptism. What do you think about the Ethiopian that Philip baptized?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I think that is one of the best texts to prove the truthfulness of what I have been saying. Let us consider the text.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;It is in the eighth chapter of Galatians, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;No, sir; it is in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+8">Acts 8</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Oh, yes, so it is; I knew it was the eighth chapter of something.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;You know, Mr. Waters, on our way over here this morning, you said that you were not going to let Mr. Wright nor anyone else change your views, that you had gone this way too long already to think of changing now, and that you were willing to take the responsibility on yourself. You remember you said the Scripture said that every tub would have to stand on its own bottom, but you could not tell me just where in the Bible to find it. I think you will find it in the eighth chapter of Galatians. Look it up when you get home.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I do not know what all Paul said to the Galatian church in his eighth chapter, but let us now read of the Ethiopian&#8217;s baptism: Philip preached Christ to the man who was going down from Jerusalem reading the Scriptures. Let me say, by the way, that we may never know what good we do when we give someone a tract, a book or a Bible. Perhaps someone had given that man a copy of the Scriptures. Philip began at the place where the Ethiopian was reading and preached Christ unto him. As they journeyed on, they came to a certain water, whereupon the Ethiopian said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;See here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+8%3A36" title="Acts 8:36"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 8:36)</span></a></span> Now listen to what Philip said: <span class="scripture">&#8220;And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he [the Ethiopian] answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+8%3A37" title="Acts 8:37"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 8:37)</span></a></span></p>

<p>You see he did not believe intellectually only, but also with <i>all his heart</i>. The Scriptures say: <span class="scripture">&#8220;with the heart man believeth unto righteousness&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+10%3A10" title="Romans 10:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 10:10)</span></a></span> and
<span class="scripture">&#8220;believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+5%3A1" title="I&nbsp;John 5:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 5:1)</span></a></span> This Ethiopian believed with all his heart that Jesus was the Son of God, and through that belief, he was born of God&#8212;made God&#8217;s child&#8212;was made righteous; he then had his sins washed away by the blood of the Lamb, and wanted to perform the outward figurative, or representative, act so that he could testify, &#8220;I am saved both in the real and in the figurative sense of salvation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Well.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Do you not think that is reasonable and that the Scriptures harmonize beautifully?</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Oh, that appears good enough, but I heard our preacher say that that verse which speaks of believing with all the heart is not in the original Bible.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Well, it is true that the thirty-seventh verse in omitted from some of the ancient manuscripts of the Bible, but some of them also contain it. It is quoted by the early church fathers, for instances, Irenaeus, who lived in the second century, and Cyprian, third century, which shows that it was a part of the Bible in their day. However, the same truth&#8212;that we must believe in Jesus in order to be saved&#8212;is set forth in many other texts.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;The Bible says somewhere that &#8220;he that is baptized shall be saved and he that is baptized not shall be damned.&#8221; I hardly think you will be able to harmonize that text with your teaching.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I was trying to mix some chemicals the other day, but I found after persistent effort, that they would not mix. By this, I learned that there are some things that will not harmonize.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I am obliged to confess, Friend Waters, that I am unable to harmonize your quotation with the Bible. Let me see, just where do you find that text?</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;I do not just know; but if you will let me take your Bible, I believe I can find it in a moment.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman (aside to Mr. Wright)&#8212;He will likely find it in the eighth chapter of Galatians.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;I do not find it at once, but I know it is in the Bible, or something very nearly like it is there.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;The text nearest like it that I call to mind, and evidently the one you are trying to quote, is <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+16%3A16">Mark 16:16</a>. Let me read it: <span class="scripture">&#8220;He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;I knew that I had it nearly right.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;But there is a vast difference between your text and this Bible text.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I do not think they would harmonize any more readily than my chemicals.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;You see this text says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;He that <i>believeth</i> and is baptized shall be saved.&#8221;</span> You were leaving the &#8220;believing&#8221; out. The believing effects the saving of the soul from sin, while the baptizing is the figurative salvation. The Ethiopian did just what this text commands, and he could then say that he was saved, really by believing, and figuratively by baptism. You quoted, &#8220;He that is baptized not,&#8221; but the Bible says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;He that <i>believeth</i> not shall be damned.&#8221;</span> You must believe or you will be damned, but you can be saved and get to heaven without being baptized, consequently the word <i>baptize</i> is omitted in the last clause.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Do you mean to say that a man can be saved and get to heaven without being baptized?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Such a thing is possible. The penitent thief on the cross went to paradise with Jesus without being baptized. In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+4%3A1-2">John 4:1-2</a>, we learn that the disciples baptized many people while Jesus was with them. The woman to whom Jesus said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+7%3A50" title="Luke 7:50"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 7:50)</span></a></span> no doubt was baptized by the disciples; but had she died after Jesus said these words to her and before she had an opportunity to be baptized, she would have gone to heaven.</p>

<p>I would not advise anyone to put off repentance until their deathbed. It is indeed most dangerous. Many souls find it impossible to repent and believe in their dying hour. Yet in some cases it is possible. After we are saved from sin by grace, through faith, we are commanded to be baptized, and we should be baptized at our first opportunity. To positively refuse to be baptized would mean the loss of salvation the same as refusing to do anything else Christ has commanded us to do.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;I have now stayed longer than I intended to stay. There are, however, some other texts I was going to give in proof of my position, one of which is in the second chapter of Acts, but I suppose it is not worth the while to consider it, as you no doubt have a nice little plausible interpretation for it already. So I will say good day to you.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Well, I have two chances to your one. I am saved by grace and have been baptized also, while you have just been baptized. If your theory should be right, I am safe anyhow. If I should be right, my dear sir, you are lost. But come again.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Thank you, Mr. Wright.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Good day.</p>

<p>(Mr. Waters leaves.)</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I have another neighbor, a dear good man, who says he wants to come and have a talk with you. He says he does not believe in a present salvation. We can be saved in eternity, he says. I desire to know the real truth respecting this matter. If there is salvation for me now, I want it. I am convinced, however, that it is not by water.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Bring your friend over. I shall be pleased to talk with him. Have I ever met him? What is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;His name is Mr. Sumday.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I have heard of a Mr. Sumday who lives over in your neighborhood, but I never met him. Come again, both of you at any time.</p>

<h1>Conversation 7</h1>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Good morning, Mr. Wright. I have brought my good friend Mr. Sumday over to get acquainted with you and you with him.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I am pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Sumday. I trust our acquaintance will mean truest and lasting friendship.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;I have been hearing considerable about you from my friend Mr. Truman, also from neighbors Works and Waters, who say that they have had some interesting talks with you. You have been reading the newspaper accounts of the great European War I suppose?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I have been reading some about it, enough to know that it is very cruel.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;Do you not think that it is a fulfillment of some of the Bible prophecies?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;No doubt it is.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;Many a soul has gone into the world beyond from those dreadful battlefields.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Yes, and the saddest of all is that many were not saved.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;No doubt some will be forever lost, but many of them will be saved in eternity.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;If they were not saved here, they will not be saved in eternity.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;Over there, my brother, over there on that other shore, the pearly gates will open to many a soul who has had his weaknesses, his &#8220;ups and downs,&#8221; who has made many crooked paths, and who has been often overcome by sin while here on this side of the dark chilly Jordan. Over there, he will find the gate ajar to the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Where in the Bible do we read of the gates being ajar over there? I understand that there is no open door into heaven on the other side of the grave, that it is down here where the door is open. Christ brought the kingdom of heaven down to this world. He says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;I am the door: by me if any man enter in he shall be saved&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+10%3A9" title="John 10:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 10:9)</span></a></span>; <span class="scripture">&#8220;Behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+3%3A8" title="Revelation 3:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 3:8)</span></a></span> The door into the kingdom of God is now open. It is before all men. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Whosoever will&#8221;</span> may come and <span class="scripture">&#8220;take the water of life freely.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+22%3A17" title="Revelation 22:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 22:17)</span></a></span> Those who fail to get in at the open door here in this life will fall to find any open door into heaven on the other side of death. The door is now open, my dear friend, and no man can shut it.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;But how can the door now be open, if as our preacher says, the kingdom will not be established until Christ comes?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Some will say, &#8220;There is no kingdom of God on earth; we cannot be saved in this life, etc.&#8221; That is an attempt to shut the door. But by Revelation 3:7, we learn that Christ has opened the door, and He alone can shut it. He is going to shut it someday. Someday He is coming back to earth for His bride&#8212;that fair and spotless bride, robed in fine linen clean and white&#8212;and then He is going to shut the door. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: <i>and the door was shut</i>.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+25%3A10" title="Matthew 25:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 25:10)</span></a></span> Alas! How foolish not to go in at the door while it is open! <span class="scripture">&#8220;Open unto us,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+13%3A25" title="Luke 13:25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 13:25)</span></a></span> will be the sad cry of those who hoped to find an open door beyond the grave and failed to enter here. Have you, Brother Sumday, entered the open door into the kingdom of God?</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;I do not believe the theory that the kingdom of God is set up here on earth.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Why not believe it? How can you not believe it? Nothing is more plainly taught in God&#8217;s Book. Listen, Christ says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+3%3A20" title="Revelation 3:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 3:20)</span></a></span> In this world, the door into the kingdom of God stands open to all who will come, but the door to the heart is sometimes closed against Christ. In the world to come, it will be reversed. Jesus will have closed the door of salvation.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;If the door into the kingdom of God stood open all the time, as you say, I should think that the kingdom would soon get filled up with thieves, murderers, gamblers, adulterers, and all sorts of people.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;It is not open in that sense. I might invite you to come to see me, saying, &#8220;My door is open unto you at any time.&#8221; But that would not mean that my door stands open all the time to all kinds of people that might come. I would expect you, and all others, to knock at the door. This is the day of salvation, and we could truthfully say this is the &#8220;knocking time.&#8221; Christ says to all, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+7%3A7" title="Matthew 7:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 7:7)</span></a></span> What a blessed promise! If the sinner comes penitently knocking (calling on the name of the Lord), the door will be opened to him. But alas! When Christ comes and time shall be no more, then the door will be shut, and all knocking will be in vain. Also Christ now stands at the door of the sinner&#8217;s heart and knocks; but after this life is over, Christ will never knock at the door of the sinner&#8217;s heart. Christ will then say to him, <span class="scripture">&#8220;I never knew you: depart from me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+7%3A23" title="Matthew 7:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 7:23)</span></a></span> Oh, may God help poor souls to knock before it is too late!</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;This idea that Christ will come into our hearts and we get into His kingdom, the idea of being so wondrously blessed and happy while here in the body, is all nonsense. One of your young sisters testified in our meeting the other evening that she was saved from all sin and was happy every moment of her life. I tell you, we never get such an experience until we get to heaven. We shall have our &#8220;ups and downs,&#8221; our dark days, our times of sorrow, our discouragements, our grief and despair, while in this life. Won&#8217;t we have cares while here in the flesh?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Yes, we shall have cares, but the Bible says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+5%3A7" title="I&nbsp;Peter 5:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 5:7)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;But we, like the good apostle Paul, will have our tribulations.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Yes, but we, like the good apostle Paul, can glory in them.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;The apostle said he had sorrow.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;Sorrowful,&#8221;</span> he said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;yet alway rejoicing.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+6%3A10" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 6:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 6:10)</span></a></span> The apostle James said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+1%3A2" title="James 1:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 1:2)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;Paul said that he was troubled on every hand and perplexed.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Yet he said that he was not distressed nor in despair.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;Again he said that he was persecuted and cast down.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;But he was not forsaken, nor destroyed.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;He said he was in famine, in nakedness, in hunger, in cold, in perils in the sea and among false brethren, etc., and we are likely to have such things in life as well as he.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;We, by God&#8217;s grace, can also say as he said, that we are content in whatsoever state we are.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;One of the young sisters, in her testimony, said that God had saved her so thoroughly that temptations never come to her anymore. Now I know that temptations will come to us in this life.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Yes, they will. I do not know why the young sister should testify in that way. It might have been that she did not notice just exactly what she said.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Pardon me, Mr. Sumday, I think you misunderstood the young lady. I was at the meeting and listened carefully to every word. She said that God had so thoroughly saved her that she was enabled to overcome all temptations. We have to listen carefully or we shall not understand. You heard old Mr. Hopewell&#8217;s testimony, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;You remember what he said about belonging to the Christian Church?</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;He did not say Christian Church. He said he belonged to the Campbellite Church for forty years, and if he had died within that time he would not have gone to heaven because he had not been saved from his sins. I thought at the time, &#8220;Foolish old man, we cannot be saved in this world.&#8221; I believe in a future salvation only.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Do you know what Mr. Newsome told a company of men that Brother Hopewell testified to?</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;No, I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;He was sitting right by the side of me and should have heard as well as I. He told them that the old man said that there had not been a Campbellite gone to heaven in forty years. I am telling you this to show you how easily we can misunderstand.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;It may be that I misunderstood the young sister; I will not be contentious over the matter. I came over, Brother Wright, to talk to you on the subject of future salvation, but we have not stuck very close to the subject. I will come again because I have much to say on this subject. Goodbye.</p>

<h1>Conversation 8</h1>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;It is a very stormy morning to be out, but I was desirous to see you, Mr. Wright, and to tell you how much I wished you were out to hear the sermon our preacher preached yesterday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Thank you. I heard a sermon yesterday morning that did me much good. As I was listening to it, I thought of you and wished ever so much that you could have heard it.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;Our preacher preached on the subject, &#8220;Future Salvation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;The sermon I heard was on the subject, &#8220;Present Salvation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;Our preacher&#8217;s text was <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+11%3A28-29">Matthew 11:28-29</a>. I have taken it down so I could tell you where it was.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;The text that the preacher I heard preached from was <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+2%3A5">Ephesians 2:5</a>, which reads <span class="scripture">&#8220;Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ (by grace ye are saved).&#8221;</span> The preacher said that &#8220;quickened&#8221; means to make alive. It is not that the sinner shall be made alive at some future time, but <span class="scripture">&#8220;you <i>hath</i> he quickened&#8221;</span>; &#8220;hath&#8221; signifies that the quickening has already been done. <span class="scripture">&#8220;By grace ye are saved&#8221;</span>&#8212;not <i>will</i> be saved, but <i>are</i> saved. If there is no present salvation, please explain that text to me.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;Oh, I do not profess to be able to explain all the texts in the Bible. I do not know just what the writer meant. I read a text in worship yesterday morning (we have worship every Sunday morning)&#8212;<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+2%3A37">Luke 2:37</a>, I believe, where the writer, speaking of Anna&#8212;the aged prophetess, said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years.&#8221;</span> Now I could not tell whether he meant that she was eighty-four years old or had been a widow for eighty-four years.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;But, Mr. Sumday, can you not see the difference between those words and the words I read you? Now, if he had said in plain words that she was eighty-four years old, you would know that he did not mean she had been a widow for eighty-four years. And then when the apostle says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Ye are saved,&#8221;</span> we know he does not mean that you shall be saved after you get into heaven. But I am puzzled to know how your preacher managed to preach a future salvation from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+11%3A28-30">Matthew 11:28-30</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;He emphasized the &#8220;will&#8221; and &#8220;shall.&#8221; <span class="scripture">&#8220;I <i>will</i> give you rest.&#8221;</span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;Ye <i>shall</i> find rest unto your soul.&#8221;</span> We shall get that rest when we get to heaven. Now, Mr. Wright, you know as well as I do that we do not find rest in this life. Moses, in the trials, troubles, and weariness of life, looked away to the sweet, verdant fields of eternal glory saying, <span class="scripture">&#8220;There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;q=There the wicked cease from troubling and there the weary be at rest " title=""><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> ()</span></a></span> That is such a comforting thought to me. I shall find rest over there.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I do not think it was Moses that used those words; it was Job at the time he was afflicted with boils from the sole of his feet to the crown of his head, when he was reviled by his wife and three neighbors. While he was in such circumstances as that, he looked away to that land where pain never comes and uttered those words. He was looking for deliverance from his bodily afflictions and not for rest to his soul.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;You can beat any man I ever met in explaining the Scriptures; you are sure to explain them in some way.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Is that not consistent? Is it not the truth? The apostle says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;For he that <i>is</i> entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A10" title="Hebrews 4:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 4:10)</span></a></span> It does not say that he will in some future day enter into his rest, but <i>is now</i> entered into rest and <i>hath</i> ceased&#8212;not <i>will</i> cease&#8212;from his own works.</p>

<p>Christ said in the text your preacher used, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Come unto me&#8230;&#8203;and I will give you rest.&#8221;</span> We certainly are to understand from these words that He will give the rest at the very time that we come to Him.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I certainly would take those words to mean about the same as Mr. Wright has explained. If I should call to that boy yonder, and say, &#8220;Come to me, and I will give you my watch,&#8221; he would expect to get the watch when he came to me, not at some time after he died. When I shall come to Christ in the Bible way, I shall certainly expect to find rest to this sin-troubled soul of mine, and the Lord helping me, I shall come someday soon.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Amen. As surely as you do, you will find the rest that Christ promised.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;My heart was deeply touched last night when my wife sang that sweet song:</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;I am coming, Lord, to Thee with my broken heart;
<br />I am coming, Lord, to Thee for rest;
<br />Wilt Thou hear my humble plea, bid my sins depart?
<br />Oh, release me, Savior, I&#8217;m oppressed.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/I_Am_Coming_Lord_to_Thee/index.html" title="I Am Coming, Lord, to Thee">*</a></p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Perhaps you gentlemen have not noticed this picture here on the wall. Oftentimes I sit looking at it for many minutes at a time and praise God for the blessed, calm soul-rest I have found in Christ. You see this part of the picture represents a stormy sea, with the wild, foaming waves dashing, the dark clouds overhanging, and the fierce lightnings flashing. There are some vessels being tossed about by the angry waves. It was so with my soul at one time. I was tossed madly about on a sin-troubled sea. <span class="scripture">&#8220;The wicked are like the troubled sea.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;q=The wicked are like the troubled sea " title=""><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> ()</span></a></span> And over there, you see a huge rock, towering high above the crest of the waves, against which they dash in vain. See, there is a cleft in the rock in which, you notice, are some tufts of grass, green shrubbery, and sweet blooming flowers. Amid the shrubbery and the flowers there sits a dove on her nest, quiet and undisturbed by the madly dashing waves below her.</p>

<p>Christ is the Rock that was cleft for me, and in that cleft my soul has found rest that the wild winds and waves of sin and the world cannot disturb. I love to sit looking at that picture and sing No. 422 in our songbook.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;What song is that?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I&#8217;ll read you a stanza or two:</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;In the clefted Rock I hide,
<br />Savior, let me here abide;
<br />Sheltered from each stormy gale,
<br />All secure within the vale.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;When the surging billows roll,
<br />There&#8217;s a calm within my soul;
<br />While my trust in Thee is stayed,
<br />I shall never be afraid.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Rock of safety&#8212;blest abode,
<br />Hid away with Christ in God;
<br />Nothing can I want beside,
<br />For my soul is satisfied.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/The_Clefted_Rock/index.html" title="The Clefted Rock">*</a></p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;All very nice indeed, enough to make one think that heaven had come to us already; but you can&#8217;t get me excited on such fine sentiments. I do not believe in this sentimental, excitable, emotional religion. I am going through in my quiet way.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;With all your &#8220;ups and downs,&#8221; troubles, weariness, and no soul rest, I should not think your way would be very quiet.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I admit that there is a wild excitable religion extant that is not commendable, but there is peace, joy, and soul rest in the pure, undefiled religion of Christ. I believe in a heartfelt religion. I do not want to quote you too many songs, lest you think me excitable, but I can scarcely refrain from quoting you a few lines of another old song:</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;I believe in a heartfelt religion
<br />That brings joy to the soul every day;
<br />The assurance of sins all forgiven,
<br />Through the blood they are all washed away.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;I believe in a holy religion,
<br />For the saints of all ages have told
<br />How it saved them from sin and its bondage,
<br />When they heard the sweet story of old.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/The_Old_Time_Religion/index.html" title="The Old-Time Religion">*</a></p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;If that were all true and lasting, it would be something worth while; but I know many who professed to have that excitable religion, and soon they were back in the world again. I am satisfied to go on with my people in our unexcitable way. There are many good people in our church, and I am sure if they keep on, they will get to heaven.</p>

<p>The rain has about ceased, I believe, and I shall go now, for I think we shall have more rain soon. But I shall come again soon, because there is one more text I want to give you to see if that will not convince you that I am right.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Do be sure to come again. Here is a book I should like for you to take along and read. Will you read it?</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;What subject is it on?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;The title is, <i>Salvation; Present, Perfect, Now or Never.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;I do not think it will do me any good to read it, besides I would have no time left for reading it after reading the newspaper and our church paper.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Let me have it, if he will not take it. Is it published by the Gospel Trumpet Company?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Yes, sir; and is an excellent little work&#8212;very soul-stirring. I should like very much for Friend Sumday to read it. Maybe he will have more time by the time you have read it, Mr. Truman; then he can read it. I hope to see you both soon.</p>

<h1>Conversation 9</h1>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;Have you heard, Friend Wright, that old Grandma Good is dead?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Why, no; I did not even know she had been sick. I think I saw her out in her yard a few days ago.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;Oh, yes; she was sick only a few hours. She died last evening. Her dying testimony was that she would be saved in heaven. She has been a member of our church for sixty years and never in all that time did she profess to have a present experience of salvation; but she expected, she hoped, to be saved in heaven. Now, would you tell me that she has not gone to heaven?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;No, I am not going to tell you any such thing. I leave all such cases in the hands of a just God. He will deal with her according to His Word. The Bible says plainly, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+3%3A3" title="John 3:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 3:3)</span></a></span> She may have been born again for ought I know; but this I do know, that without that experience she or I or you or anyone else cannot go to heaven.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;She believed in being born again or converted in just this way: conversion is simply a turning-around. Mr. Truman here says he is a sinner; now, all there is in conversion for him is to decide that he will be a better man, that he will take upon himself the profession and duties of a Christian.</p>

<p>This idea of a miraculous work in the heart, of great joy and peace flooding the soul, of being made new, etc.&#8212;Grandma Good never believed in it, and neither do I. Whatever influence your talks may have had over me at first was all removed last evening when I saw that good old woman die.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;The gospel of Jesus Christ comes to the souls of men as the balmy days of spring comes to nature&#8212;it brings life and joy. The gospel is good news. The heart that receives the gospel feels its love as truly as man ever felt the love of woman; that heart tastes its sweetness as truly as man ever tasted the flavor of the most delicious fruits; it hears the melody of the gospel&#8217;s song as truly as you ever heard the song of birds in June; it is delighted by the aroma of grace as truly as man was ever delighted by the fragrance of orange blossoms.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;The text on which I have founded my belief is found in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+24%3A13">Matthew 24:13</a>&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.&#8221;</span> In this life, there is something to endure; beyond this life, or after the end, there is salvation. I believe in a future salvation and a future salvation only.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I believe in a future salvation, but to say there is no salvation other than a future salvation is to say so in the face of many plain texts of Scripture that positively teach to the contrary. Such a course is dangerous.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;I did not know that you believed in a future salvation at all.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Why, I believe all the Bible and the text you just read speaks of a salvation beyond the end of life.</p>

<p>Let me tell you, as I have told Mr. Works and Mr. Waters, there are different phases of the term salvation as used in the Bible. Mr. Works says that salvation is by works and works only. There is a salvation by works, but that is only one phase of salvation.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters says that salvation is by baptism. There is a salvation by baptism, but that is only another phase of the term as we have it used in the Bible.</p>

<p>You say that salvation is future, and future only. There is a salvation future, but that is only another phase of the term.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;Well, I am glad I have met you and had these talks with you. We cannot all be of the same opinion. So you go your way, and I will go mine, and I trust we shall both get to heaven. I must be going now.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;It is not your way nor my way that will lead us to heaven, but the Bible way; unless we take that way we shall never reach heaven. It is early, so do not go yet. I want to say that the Bible teaches a salvation by works, a salvation by baptism, a salvation future, but it also teaches a salvation by grace through faith. This salvation is present. It is a salvation from sin, the salvation that prepares us for the future salvation. Let me explain this future salvation to you.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;I think I understand it.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;You see, as long as we are here in the flesh we are creatures subject to temptation, but if we overcome the temptations and keep from committing sin unto the end, then we shall be forever saved, or forever safe. Here, there is a possibility of losing our present experience of salvation and of being lost eternally; but if we watch and pray and endure unto the end, we shall then gain that blessed place where temptations never come and where we shall be saved forever. Don&#8217;t you, can&#8217;t you see?</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;I can see what you mean, and I must, as an honest man, confess that it looks good and reasonable, but I have never had any present experience of salvation from sin, no flooding of the soul with joy. Your reasoning and the scriptures you have read have exerted a convincing power upon me; but think of it, I have professed this way for many years, and for me to change now, bringing the censure and criticism of my good brethren upon me, I tell you, it is too humiliating. I cannot do it! I would rather die and be l&#8212;</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Don&#8217;t say that, please don&#8217;t. If you would only get the experience God has for you, you would be so filled with peace and love that you would be disturbed but little by the scorns of your church people.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;If I were to get the experience you have been talking about, they would turn me out of the church, and I could never stand that.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;When they turn you out, Christ will take you in. Would you rather be turned out by the church and taken in by Christ, or turned out by Christ and taken in by the church?</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;I would rather be taken in by Christ. Oh, may He have mercy upon me! But I am not going to give in, I have taken this way too long to turn from it now. I will take my chances. If I am lost, I shall not be the only one lost; so I just won&#8217;t do it, that is all there is about it; <i>I won&#8217;t do it.</i> I am going now, so goodbye.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I am sorry to see you go now. Won&#8217;t you stay a little longer? I have some more good things to say to you and some more very encouraging and convincing scriptures to read to you.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;You have read too many to me now. I wish I had never come to have a talk with you. Your talks were troubling me some, but when I saw Grandma Good die last evening and heard her say that she expected to go to heaven, it consoled me greatly for she believed just as I had been believing. Your talk today, however, and epecially the explanation you give of the text on which I had built my fondest hopes, has unsettled me. I was contented before I had these talks; now I do not know that I ever shall be contented again.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Let me say this much more to you. A man has a roll of money in his pocket. It is his; he has it in his possession; he feels it; he knows he has it; he knows also that there is danger of losing it; but someday when he can go to the city, he will deposit it in the bank, and then, it will be safe.</p>

<p>Your soul can be saved now. You can have salvation. You can feel it; you can know you have it. I admit the possibility of your losing it while here in the flesh; but if you watch and pray, you can keep it, and someday you shall go to that <span class="scripture">&#8220;city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+11%3A10" title="Hebrews 11:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 11:10)</span></a></span> There you can deposit it in the bank of eternal life where it will be safe forever. But, oh, my dear friend, you must get it here, or you shall have nothing to deposit when you get there.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;I respect you, Friend Wright; but allow me to say I do not care to hear any more. I am going now.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Come over again in a few days. Won&#8217;t you come? I would be very glad to have you come.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;No, I do not think I shall come anymore. I shall try to get reconciled in my old way. Goodbye.</p>

<p>(Mr. Sumday leaves.)</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I wish, Mr. Truman, that you would try to get him to come back again; the Holy Spirit is striving with him. He is not far from the kingdom of God. May God pluck him as a brand from the burning!</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I shall try my very best to get him to come. It is hard for those who have long been taught that cold, formal religion to ever see the true way.</p>

<p>I see you believe that although we do have a present experience of salvation, there is a possibility of losing it. I have a neighbor who says that when we are once in grace, we can never fall. I would like to bring him over to have a talk with you, if you do not object.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I have no objection. I shall be very glad to have him come. I did not discern that the truth was getting hold of Mr. Sumday as it was.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I knew it from what he would say to me, but he tried to keep it hid from you, Mr. Wright. He is calling me, so I shall go.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Bring Mr. Sumday over again soon if you can, and that other man also.</p>

<h1>Conversation 10</h1>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Wife, our good friend Mr. Truman has sent me word that he is going to bring his neighbor Mr. Cicure over this morning to have a talk with me on the subject, &#8220;Once in grace always in grace.&#8221; Now, I want you to pray. He has no Scriptural support for that belief, but nearly always those who have the least support for their belief are the most immovable in their belief; those with the least light are the blindest to light.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wright&#8212;Yes, Mrs. Truman told me that he is the most selfish man she ever knew. He has no friends, and he thinks all others are to blame.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Is that so? They are coming now. You pray earnestly that God give me words of wisdom.</p>

<p>Good morning, gentlemen. Come in.</p>

<p>(Enter Mr. Truman and Mr. Cicure.)</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;It is a fine morning, Mr. Wright. I have brought my neighbor Mr. Cicure over to have a talk with you. I take pleasure in introducing him to you.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I am pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Cicure, and give you a hearty welcome into my home. I hope our conversing together will establish a lifelong friendship.</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;I hope so; however, I am slow and cautious in the choosing of friends, for I have been imposed upon many times.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;In such a good community as this, we are quite safe in making friends with all.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Say, gentlemen, I found something here in a religious paper that I would like to read to you.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;What can it be? Read it.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I will read only a few paragraphs:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">It is the law of the universe to give in return for what is received. Nature, God, and society echo back to man what is received from man. The Husbandman gives the seed to the earth, and the earth gives back the golden harvest. The vine-dresser gives his care to the vines, and they give back the luscious fruitage. Give culture to the garden, and it will give back blooming flowers; give water to the desert, and it will return fields of grain. Give food to the birds when winter has locked up her stores, and they will give back their sweet spring songs.</p>

<p>Give God thyself, and thou shalt receive Himself. Give Him thy ways, and He will give thee His hand to lead thee in His ways. Give Him humble, loving submission, and He will give thee mercy like the wideness of the sea. Give the cup of water, in His name, to thy fellow man, the loaf to the hungry, and from the open windows of heaven, thou shalt receive thy reward.</p>

<p>As with nature and with God, so also is it with society. The world has nothing to give to those from whom it has received nothing, but she extends her hand to all who extend their hand to her. Share thy crust and thy cloak with thy fellow, and man will heap treasures into thy bosom. Show thyself friendly, and thou shalt have friends. Give thy service to man, and the world will rise up to call thee blessed.</p>

<p>A boy visiting in the mountains chanced one day to call aloud, whereupon he was mocked by a hidden stranger boy. The insult made him very angry, so he shouted back insult and epithets. These bad words returned from the mountainside. With bitter tears, the boy went to his mother, who sent him back to give the hidden stranger kind words and affectionate greetings. The stranger now echoed back the same kindness. Man receives what he gives, whether it be to nature, to God, or to society.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;I thank you. I am not so dull as to fail to understand its import. I know you meant it for me. But I know a thing or two, and one is to look out for myself. I am a man of business, and when I have a job on hand, I generally get at it.</p>

<p>I have come over to have a talk with you, Mr. Wright, on the subject of salvation. I have heard that you believe in the possibility of falling from grace, but I sincerely hope I have been misinformed, for I should regret that a man of your seeming intelligence would believe such an absurd thing.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;You have been correctly informed. You believe in the impossibility of falling from grace?</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;I certainly do, and am proud of my faith.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;No doubt our research of the Scripture and reasonings together will reveal in which of these beliefs lies the greater absurdity.</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;I want to ask you first, however, if the <i>Gospel Trumpet</i> is not your paper.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I read it. Have you been reading it?</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;I read a copy occasionally, but why I ask you is I have a letter here from a friend of mine living in Georgia. He sent a copy of this letter, I think to the Gospel Trumpet Office for publication, but they refused to publish it. I should like to read you a portion of it. He says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noindent first">To the church of God which is at Anderson, Indiana, and to those throughout the whole world:</p>

<p>I now desire to show and set forth the true light pertaining to some of the mysteries of the gospel of God and our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, which the Holy Ghost hath made known unto me in these last days.</p>

<p>Now dear friends, there is a point which I desire to take up and to make plain to your minds, which is very puzzling and confusing to the human heart. It is this, that a person who has been born again can fall from grace. Now, I say before God the Father, and before our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at His appearing, that this doctrine is not according to the Word of God, as I shall show.</p>

<p>Now, I earnestly contend, as the Holy Ghost has showed me, that a person that has been born again cannot fall from grace&#8230;. When a man gets to the place where he knows how to save himself and to save others and how to meet the devil on every point, he has then reached a state of development of maturity and has been born again, as is seen in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+5%3A14">Hebrews 5:14</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8220;But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.&#8221;</span> Now, it is this class that Paul speaks of in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+6%3A4-6">Hebrews 6:4-6</a> where he says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;It is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.&#8221;</span></p>

</blockquote>


<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Why that text deals a deathblow to the man&#8217;s own doctrine. Paul says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;If they shall fall away,&#8221;</span> which is a clear admission of the possibility of their falling away. But that man says it is impossible for such to fall away.</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;It would be better that you wait until I am through reading, then you would know more what you are talking about.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I beg your pardon; I thought you were through reading.</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;But I am not, if you please. He goes on to explain: &#8220;Now, Paul does not assert positively here, however, that this class of people cannot fall.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Truman (aside to Mr. Wright): Indeed, he does not; but he does say it is possible for them to fall.</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;&#8220;But he adds further that if they do fall, there is no chance of repentance for them, while we are told most positively again in the <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=first+chapter+of+Second+Peter">first chapter of Second Peter</a> that this class of people cannot fall, so we see from the reading of these texts here that when a person has attained to this height, he never falls.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;What are you &#8220;ha-haing&#8221; about?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I just thought how we could get Paul and Peter into a &#8220;mix-up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;What do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Why don&#8217;t you see that this man has Paul teaching one thing and Peter the contrary?</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;How do you make that out anyway?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Now, see here. Would Paul give such a warning if he did not well know there is a possibility of falling away? Surely not! Seems to me I can hear him saying, &#8220;I have not forgotten Demas, who forsook me, having loved this present world, nor have I forgotten those foolish Galatians who did run well, but were hindered and fell from grace because they turned back to the law; also I see the church at Laodicea are falling away, and God will soon spue them out of His mouth.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then Peter&#8217;s teaching: your article would have him say that it is impossible for those who have been born again to fall away from grace. But Peter nowhere says that. This man has misrepresented Peter.</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;Do you know what you are talking about? You are making a strong statement about my friend.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Just let me finish my proof. I hope your friend has not misrepresented Peter willfully. In the first chapter of Second Peter are the most solemn warnings to those who had obtained like precious faith with him, lest they should become blind and forget that they were purged from their old sins. You see he gives a warning very similar to Paul&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;Well then, why does he say they can never fall?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Peter says that those who are diligent and keep the graces of the Spirit growing within them&#8212;they cannot fall while they are in that state of spiritual growth; but that is quite different from saying that those who have once entered grace can never backslide and fall.</p>

<p>Just a minute more for a simple illustration: A ball that is thrown upward can never come down as long as it is going up; but the moment it ceases to go up, it will start down and not cease until it strikes the earth with a thud. So long as a Christian is going forward, he cannot go backward, but when he ceases to go forward, he will go backward.</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;I am sorry to be interrupted. There is more of this letter I wish to read. It goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Now, to make it a little plainer, a thing that is born is of the same substance as its mother. We know that God is a Spirit and that every element of Him is pure and divine, hence before we can be born into His kingdom, we have to be pure even as He is pure. We can readily see that a person before he is born into the kingdom of God is perfect in knowledge and understanding, and when one has reached such a state, he cannot be reborn the second time. Nicodemus said to Jesus, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mothers womb, and be born? Jesus answered&#8230;. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+3%3A4-6" title="John 3:4-6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 3:4-6)</span></a></span> It would not be common sense, nor would it be according to any of the laws of God, either natural or divine, to say that a thing that had once been born could be reborn a second time.</p>

<p>This is all I care to read. I heartily agree with what this writer has said. It is most reasonable. I am sorry some are so unreasonable. I&#8217;m going now.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;You will come again, won&#8217;t you?</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;I do not think I shall; it would be of no use.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I want you to come again. You know you said that they would not publish this manuscript at the Trumpet Office&#8212;and I am not surprised at that&#8212;but one of the brethren there wrote the man a good, kind, plain letter, which I hope has shown the man his error. Have you read it?</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;No, I have not. I did not know that such a letter was written.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;That&#8217;s the way it usually goes. Only one side of the story is told. You come over tomorrow, and I&#8217;ll have that letter here for you. It has some points that will make you think.</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;Well, I should like to hear it, so I may come again.</p>

<h1>Conversation 11</h1>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;Well, I have come over this morning, Mr. Wright, to hear the reading of that letter you spoke about.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Very well, I will get it and read it to you with pleasure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noindent first">Dear Brother in Christ:</p>

<p>May the Lord bless you. Your manuscript of forty pages received denying that a person who has been born of God may fall. I will not have time to discuss all the points you mention, but will call your attention to a few scriptures which you have surely misinterpreted. I will also present a number of texts which you have passed over in silence and which place the entire subject in a different light.</p>

<p>You make mention of the visit of Nicodemus to Christ. Nicodemus did not understand how a person could enter into his mother&#8217;s womb and be born again. The fact of the case is, he had not yet accepted Christ and had not received a change of heart&#8212;conversion. The new birth was just as mysterious to him as it is to you.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;I do not like such insinuations. His words imply that the &#8220;new birth&#8221; is mysterious to that brother for the same reason that it was mysterious to Nicodemus, because he had not been converted. I am not going to stay to hear such ridicule.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;It may sound much worse to you than this writer intended. I think his writing is mild and kind. Let us keep cool and hear the end.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">You do not seem to understand what is meant when Jesus said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+3%3A6" title="John 3:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 3:6)</span></a></span> He meant to say, &#8220;Nicodemus, when you were born into this world, it was a birth of the flesh; but what I am trying to get you to understand now is that you must be born again, that is, you must have a spiritual birth by faith in Jesus Christ.&#8221;</p>

<p>You do not believe that a man can lose his soul after he has been once enlightened, and yet I notice you became very much confused on the subject when you undertook to explain <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+6%3A4-6">Hebrews 6:4-6</a>. I will give a clear explanation of this text before concluding this letter.</p>

<p>According to your own letter, God&#8217;s purpose in the redemptive plan was to restore to man what he lost through Adam&#8217;s fall. What was lost through Adam? And why was it lost? Adam was created pure and holy&#8212;in the image and likeness of God. Coming directly from the hand of the holy Creator, there could be no spot of sin in him. But he afterwards fell, as you admit. This fact proves positively that Adam&#8217;s state was a probational one: that the maintenance of holiness was, on his part, wholly conditional.</p>

<p>Redemption through Christ simply restores man to this original state of <span class="scripture">&#8220;righteousness and true holiness&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+4%3A24" title="Ephesians 4:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 4:24)</span></a></span>; but being still on probation, there is the same liability of his failing away. And this agrees with the teaching of the New Testament. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+10%3A12" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 10:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 10:12)</span></a></span> Judas failed to retain his integrity, therefore we read that <span class="scripture">&#8220;Judas by transgression fell.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+1%3A25" title="Acts 1:25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 1:25)</span></a></span> Peter teaches that it is possible for Christians to fall away, with the result that <span class="scripture">&#8220;the latter end is worse with them than the beginning&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+2%3A20" title="II&nbsp;Peter 2:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 2:20)</span></a></span>; while Jesus Himself admonishes the backsliders in the church, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+2%3A5" title="Revelation 2:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 2:5)</span></a></span></p>

</blockquote>


<p>Now, I need not read the remainder of the letter, except the conclusion, as in meaning, it is the same as Friend Truman and I explained in our talk the other day, both on the interpretation of <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+6%3A4-6">Hebrews 6:4-6</a> and <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+1">II&nbsp;Peter 1</a>. I do not understand how anyone can fail to see at once that Peter does not at all teach that one cannot fall, but does teach to the contrary. I will read you a few words this brother says on this point:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">He [Peter] tells them that if they do those things and abound they shall never fall; as much as to say that if they do not do those things, they will fall.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Then the conclusion of the letter reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Now, I would advise you to consider this matter carefully and be sure that you are willing to accept the plain teaching of the Scripture.</p>

<p>Trusting you will receive this in the spirit in which it is given, I remain,</p>

<p class="signature">Yours in Him,<br />&#8212;&#8212;</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Let me say kindly, but candidly, that there is not a single text in the Bible to support your doctrine; neither does reason stand on your side. To say that a man who has been converted, or born again, can sin the same as a sinner who has not been born again and that he can go to heaven but the sinner cannot, is contrary to the Scriptures, to justice, and to reason. Will you please give me one text that teaches the impossibility of falling from grace?</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;I admit that I cannot refer you to a text that says as much in plain words, but surely such is implied in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+3%3A9">I&nbsp;John 3:9</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Read the text please.</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>When a person is born again, there is a seed of the kingdom of heaven planted in the heart; and as this text says, that seed <span class="scripture">&#8220;remaineth in him&#8221;</span>; notwithstanding how deep he may go in sin in after years, that seed is always in his heart! And in God&#8217;s own way and time, he will be accepted into the everlasting kingdom above.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Perhaps you did not notice how your words contradicted the words of the text you read. The text you read says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;For his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.&#8221;</span> Now, according to the text, if this seed remains in him he cannot sin, but you said, &#8220;notwithstanding how deep he may go in sin in after years, that seed is always in his heart.&#8221; You say something directly contrary to what the text says.</p>

<p>I never saw a person who believed in the doctrine of &#8220;once in grace always in grace&#8221; but who also testified that he committed sin more or less. Do you live without committing sin?</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;I do not know that anyone has a right to be inquiring into my manner of life. As a rule, I keep myself to myself. Suppose I should ask you such question?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I am sure I should give you a kind, respectful answer. I believe that the God who saves us from sin is able to keep us from sin if we trust in Him; but to say that we could not sin if we desired to; or if we did sin, we were still saved is, I say, contrary to the Bible.</p>

<p>The apostle Peter tells us that the seed planted in the heart of those who are born again is the word of God. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible [seed] by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+1%3A23" title="I&nbsp;Peter 1:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 1:23)</span></a></span> The word of God is the seed. If we keep the word in our hearts, we shall not sin; in the very nature of things, we cannot sin. Out of the heart are the issues of life. Man will live out what is in his heart. If he has the word of God in his heart, he will live out the word of God. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin against thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+119%3A11" title="Psalm 119:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 119:11)</span></a></span> To say that the word of God cannot be lost out of the heart after once being sown in it, is contrary to the parable of the Sower (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+4%3A15">Mark 4:15</a>). Ah, my friend, the text you read does not teach the impossibility of falling from grace, but the secret of holy living.</p>

<p>Just another word, while I am speaking: The apostle says to Christians, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+5%3A8" title="I&nbsp;Peter 5:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 5:8)</span></a></span> If we who have been born again are not vigilant&#8212;watchful&#8212;the devil will devour us. That is why Christ says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+14%3A38" title="Mark 14:38"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 14:38)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;Well, I know I am all right. I may do a good many things now that are not what they should be, but I will get to heaven just the same.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;The Bible says that all liars <span class="scripture">&#8220;shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+21%3A8" title="Revelation 21:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 21:8)</span></a></span> The man who tells falsehoods after he has been born again will have to take his place with the man that tells falsehoods who never has been born again.</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;It is my business only if I tell lies, if I am clever enough to keep them covered so they will not be discovered.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;You seem to forget those solemn words of truth: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Be sure your sin will find you out.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Numbers+32%3A23" title="Numbers 32:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Numbers 32:23)</span></a></span> All sins prosper under cover until they become so multiplied and thrifty they can no longer be hid. <span class="scripture">&#8220;He that covereth his sins shall not prosper,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+28%3A13" title="Proverbs 28:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 28:13)</span></a></span> but the sins will prosper because they, under cover, are in their element.</p>

<p>Let me tell you the story of the Irishman. It is a little humorous, yet I tell it not for the humor&#8217;s sake but for the solemn truth it contains.</p>

<p>A lady who had an Irishman working for her asked him one day to catch a mole in her garden. After three days&#8217; digging, he succeeded in catching it, whereupon, addressing the little creature, he said, &#8220;Ye nasty varmint; you have caused me so much sweat o&#8217; mine brow, I will bury ye alive.&#8221; Accordingly, he took it and buried it in the earth&#8212;in its own element. So when you cover sins, you are putting them in their own element, and they will work your ruin.</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;I do not intend for any man to teach me. I am expecting to paddle my own canoe. So I will bid you good day.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;If we have not agreed on the Scriptures, this will not prevent our being friends, so if at any time I can be of any service to you in any way, I wish you would call on me. Goodbye.</p>

<p>(Mr. Cicure leaves.)</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Now, Mr. Wright, I want you to have patience with me. There is one more man whom I want you to talk with. He has not lived in our neighborhood very long, but I am sure he is a fine man and will make a good neighbor. He says he doesn&#8217;t believe we can live without sinning more or less, and he thinks the Scriptures teach that we shall sin as long as we are in this life.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I shall be pleased to have you bring him over at your convenience. And now, Mr. Truman, I am praying much for you. Why postpone the matter of salvation any longer? Why not get saved today?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I suppose I should, in fact, I know I should; I am growing more restless each day, but it seems that Satan in some way hinders me. I suppose I should not have waited so long as I have, but I tell you I was confused. There were so many saying this way is salvation and that way is salvation that I did not know what to do. The confusion is clearing away from my mind, little by little, so keep on praying for me. Your prayers will not be in vain.</p>

<h1>Conversation 12</h1>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Come in, gentlemen. I was just hoping and praying you would come over this morning, for I am desiring to have a good talk with someone about the wonderful salvation of the Lord.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;That is what we have come for. This is my neighbor Mr. Synsum. He has recently moved into our neighborhood, but he lives nearly half way between my place and yours, so you can claim him as neighbor, too.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I claim you both as neighbors. I have seen, you, Friend Synsum, pass on the road a few times, but I never had the pleasure of shaking your hand before. How do you like this country?</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;So far, I like it fine, and I know of no reason why I should not continue to like it.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Is that the morning paper? What is the special news?</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;No, this is yesterday&#8217;s paper. Are you interested in the history of our times? What do you think about preparedness?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I am a firm believer in preparedness. I wish all the preachers in the land would preach it from their pulpits. I wish every Christian would talk it everywhere he goes. I wish the press would send it out to the ends of the earth. You know <span class="scripture">&#8220;the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+5%3A8" title="I&nbsp;Peter 5:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 5:8)</span></a></span> I believe in being prepared&#8212;prepared to successfully resist him.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;Oh, you mean spiritual preparedness?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Yes, that is most important. Someday, the Son of God is coming again, and we know that death is on the track of every man. I believe in being prepared. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+24%3A44" title="Matthew 24:44"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 24:44)</span></a></span> Someday, we must stand before God in judgment. I believe in being prepared&#8212;prepared to meet the Lord.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;I understand your doctrine of preparedness; but people do not seem to be so enthusiastic about the preparedness you advocate as they are about the preparedness the President advocates. But what, in your estimation, must a man do to be prepared?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;To be prepared to meet God, we must be saved&#8212;saved from sin. Jesus came to save people from their sins. He came to prepare us for a place He has gone to prepare for us. The place He has gone to prepare for us is a holy place. To be prepared for that place, we must be holy.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;Well, now, to tell you my view, I do not believe in holiness. For a long time, I have been trying to serve God; I have been doing my very best, for I wanted to be just right, but I have never gotten to that place where I could accept the idea that poor, weak, finite man can be holy and live holy. It seems to me, do the very best we can, we shall sin some. I know I do. I think it would be grand to get to a place where we could live without sinning, but it does seem to me that such a place is not this side of heaven.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Merely because I cannot comprehend all that the scientists say about the nature of light, of sound, of the distance of the stars, etc., would be, do you not thank, an unwise reason for me to say that what they say is not true and discredit it? I believe some things that I cannot comprehend because in the light of reason I know they must be true. But holiness is plainly taught in the Bible.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;I know that it is, but I cannot believe it to be a holiness that is not in the least alloyed with sin. It seems to me that what Jesus would call a holy life for us is one that has sin in it, but in which we strive against sin as much as we can. I am living a holy life as I understand holiness. I am not able to believe that man can attain to such holiness as is free from all sin in this life.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;You must be aware that sin and holiness are directly opposite in their nature. They are as directly opposite as heat and cold, light and darkness. Holiness is an element, or characteristic, found in the nature of God. Sin is an element, or characteristic, found in the nature of the devil. There is not the least atom of sin in the nature of God. Do you think there is?</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;No; I do not. I believe that God is absolutely and perfectly holy.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Neither is holiness found in the nature of the devil. How can a combination of such unlike, antagonistic natures rule in a man&#8217;s heart, and we call him &#8220;Christian&#8221;?</p>

<p>Surely we can be made holy; we can be made free from all sin; we can be in the image of God. I will read you a text from the Book: <span class="scripture">&#8220;And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+4%3A24" title="Ephesians 4:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 4:24)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;True holiness&#8221;</span> is pure holiness&#8212;holiness without the least alloy of sin. The words, <span class="scripture">&#8220;after God,&#8221;</span> in the above texts means in the likeness of God. The new man that we put on when we become Christians, with respect to righteousness and holiness is in the likeness of God.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;There is a text that I do not see how you can harmonize with your teaching. It is this: &#8220;He that saith he liveth and sinneth not is a liar and the truth is not in him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Well, how astonishing! That quotation or rather misquotation, seems to be worldwide. I have never met a man who believed that we must sin more or less through life but who would quote those words, believing them to be Scripture.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;Do you mean to say that they are not Scripture?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Yes, that is what I mean to say. For a long time, I thought those words were in the Bible, but I have found they are not.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;That surprises me. Well, what will you do with these words? &#8220;We are all sinners by nature and much more so by practise&#8221;&#8212;that is Bible.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;You will take no offense, I trust, if I call that in question?</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;Call what in question?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;That those words are to be found in the Bible. I am sure, my dear friend, they are not to be found in God&#8217;s Holy Book. However, they are true of all, sometime in life. I was once a sinner by nature, and I was much more so practise, but I quit the practise, and God saved me both from sin and the nature of sin; and now I am not a sinner by nature nor by practise.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;If those words I have been quoting are not to be found in the Bible, I have for a long time been misinformed. I have heard them quoted all my life, and I am not yet ready to believe they are not Scripture. I shall look for myself.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;A very wise thing to do.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;We all know well enough that Paul said, &#8220;I am a sinner saved by grace.&#8221; Now, tell me what he meant if he did not mean that he was saved&#8212;was a Christian&#8212;yet sinned more or less.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Again I am very sorry to doubt you, but I am very certain that those words are not the words of Paul.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;Who, then, was it that used them?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I do not know. It must have been a writer of later date than the Bible, because I never read such words in the writings of any of the apostles.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;Do you mean to say that such words are not in the Bible?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I am quite sure that such an expression is not in the Bible.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;I will determine that for myself by a thorough search.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Let us look for a moment at the unreasonableness of such a testimony. Suppose here is a man who is a slave to tobacco. He tries to free himself, but tries in vain. He hears of the silver-nitrate cure. He resolves to try it. He does so and testifies that he is cured&#8212;that he is saved from the tobacco habit. But we see him afterward using tobacco more or less. You say to him, &#8220;I thought you said you were saved from the tobacco habit?&#8221;</p>

<p>He replies, &#8220;So I am. I am a tobacco user saved by the silver-nitrate cure.&#8221; What would you think of such a salvation, Mr. Synsum?</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;I would think there was no salvation to it.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;So here is a man who is under the bondage of sin. He tries to free himself, but tries in vain. He hears of the grace cure. He resolves to try it. He does so and testifies that he is cured&#8212;that he is saved from sin. But we see him afterward sinning more or less. You say to him, &#8220;I thought you said you were saved from sin?&#8221; He replies, &#8220;So I am; I am a sinner saved by grace.&#8221; What would you think of such a salvation? You are compelled to answer in the same words you used in reference to the tobacco user that was saved by the silver-nitrate cure: &#8220;There is no salvation to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;I have been looking through your Bible here, and I have found a text that reads something like the first one I quoted, though not exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Read it, please.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.&#8221;</span> That is in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1%3A8">I&nbsp;John 1:8</a>. I would like to hear what you would have to say about that text to prevent it contradicting your holy-living theory; but I have stayed now longer than I intended so must wait your explanation until I come again.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I have a little booklet here entitled, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/A_Religious_Controversy/index.html" title="A Religious Controversy">A Religious Controversy</a>,&#8221; that will explain that text and a number of others which, standing apart from the context, seem to contradict the doctrine of holy living. I think when you have read that little book, you will be convinced that there are no texts in the Holy Book that condemn holiness of life.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;I shall read the little book. Thank you. Goodbye.</p>

<h1>Conversation 13</h1>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Well, I am glad to see you, Neighbor Synsum. I have been wanting to tell you that we are going to have Brother Goodman preach for us the first Sunday of next month.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;In the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Yes, at 10:30. Will you bring your family?</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;Oh, I suppose we might as well come. We might learn something more about this problem of holy living.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;There are many people, Neighbor Synsum, that do not understand the meaning of holy living. They seem to think that sin so prevails and permeates everything that one can scarcely breathe or open his mouth to speak a word without committing sin. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Sin is a transgression of the law.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+3%3A4" title="I&nbsp;John 3:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 3:4)</span></a></span> To live a holy life is to live in humble, loving obedience to all God&#8217;s Word.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;I do not think we can live to all God&#8217;s Word.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Why, Mr. Synsum! You will agree with me that God is love and that He is just?</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;Certainly I agree to that.</p>

<p>(Mr. Truman arrives.)</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Good morning, gentlemen; here you are talking again.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;Yes, I got here ahead of you. We have just gotten started.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;To continue our thought: you believe that God is just. Would a just and loving parent demand things of his children that he knew they could not do? Now, God does demand things of us that we cannot do of ourselves, but He will help us to do all He has commanded us to do. A man might say to his son, &#8220;Johnny, I want you to lift that stone, and then I will give you an orange.&#8221; The boy is convinced that he cannot lift it, but the father commands him to obey. He takes hold of the stone and begins to lift; the father then, unseen by the boy, places his hand under the stone and helps him do what he could not do alone. And then the father gives him an orange. It appears to you that God has commanded you to do things you cannot do; but whenever He demands anything of us, if we set out in loving obedience to obey, He will always help us.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;He tells us in His Word to put away anger. Now, I get angry; I cannot help it. Then, when I get angry, I say some things I ought not to say, and I do not think there is a man living who does not.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Because I might get a tumble in every attempt to fly an aircraft, would it be just to conclude that no man could fly one?</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;Of course not, but I tell you, I have never seen that man yet who could keep mild-tempered and sweet amid the provocations that are certain to arise in home life. Just the other day while I was reading the war news, wife, who was doing some work in front of me, stepped back a step and stepped square on a corn on my toe. I know that is not the most handsome thing to tell; but such things happen, and it happened to me&#8212;and don&#8217;t tell me I could keep from getting angry; why, before I had time to think, I told her something.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;And the poor woman had to take abuse for a thing unintentionally done. Your wife is a good woman.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;I know she is, God bless her; but I do get provoked with her sometimes and say some things I ought not say. I do not believe that any man is able to avoid getting a little angry or impatient in his home and saying some things he ought not say. Do you?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Oh, yes; I am very well acquainted with a man and his wife who have not spoken the least unkind word to each other for years. My dear man, do you not think that Christ can help us to live in our homes as we ought to live? Love should reign supreme in the home. No harsh word should ever be uttered, no unkind feeling should ever be entertained. A home filled with love and kindness is a little emblem of heaven. Shall heaven have no emblem on earth? Alas! They are too few; but thank God, there are a few.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;If I could be persuaded that such a thing is possible, I would make it so in my case regardless of the cost.</p>

<p>But I want to speak to you now about some testimonies I heard last night. Some of your young people were down to our meeting last night. They are nice young people, as nice as I ever saw, but one of the young ladies said that God had saved her so completely that she could not sin. Now, that is going too far. One of our neighbors claims that he cannot sin or cannot fall from grace, and I am sorry to say he is the only disagreeable man in all the community. None of us care to have any dealings with him.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I suppose you have reference to Mr. Cicure. I have had a few talks with him, and I do not care to have any more, for, as you say, he is not a pleasant man to talk with. But is it not possible that you misunderstood the young sister? I have not heard any of the young people make such claims.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I was at the meeting and heard all the testimonies and I did not hear anyone use those words. I know sometimes we misunderstand others. Let me tell you a story I heard last week. Three ladies on their way to a Thursday afternoon meeting passed a man and his wife on the street. When those ladies met with the other ladies at their place of meeting, a general talk began upon the various events of the day. One of the three ladies said, &#8220;Mr. and Mrs. Brown have been to the zoo because as we passed them on our way here, I heard them say something about the &#8216;trained deer.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221; A second one of the three ladies smiled saying, &#8220;You are much mistaken; they are going away somewhere; for the wife said to her husband (I heard it distinctly), &#8216;Find out about the train, dear.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221; At this, the third woman laughed heartily and exclaimed, &#8220;How dull of hearing you both were! I was next to them as we passed, and I remember I thought at the time they were going to study music, because she said something about getting a man with a &#8216;trained ear.&#8221; Then those ladies began their dispute about which was right. But Mrs. Brown herself came in. They took the matter to her at once. She said, &#8220;How stupid you all were! I had just been out in the country over night, and I was asking my husband if it &#8216;rained here&#8217; last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>So you see, Mr. Synsum, that it is easy to get a wrong understanding. I remember that one young lady said that God kept her each day free from sin, but I did not hear anyone say she could not sin.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;Well, I might have misunderstood her, so before I become positive, I shall ask some others who were there.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Did you read the little booklet I gave you?</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;I read every word of it to my wife, and we thought it was the most interesting book we have read in a long time. I must confess that it puts some texts of Scripture in a different light than I ever saw before. I saw my own picture in the little book. I am just like that husband was. When the pigs get in the garden and are very contrary about going out, I get mad. I do not see how in the world anyone can help it. I am going to ask you, Mr. Wright, don&#8217;t you ever get angry?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I am very happy to tell you that the blood of Christ has cleansed my heart from all carnal anger, malice, hatred, and every other sin, so that I live day after day as the Bible says man should live. There is not one wrong thing I am obliged to do&#8212;not one commandment I am obliged to transgress. No; by the grace of God, I am enabled to live each day free from sin.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;My neighbors, Mr. Works, Mr. Waters, and Mr. Sumday, have been talking about you. We think probably that it is excitement with you, so we have concluded to watch you for awhile. The life, you know, speaks louder than the testimony of words.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I am perfectly willing for you to watch my life. Should I, however, make a misstep (as some I know have done) and fall into sin, the Word of God and the power of His grace stand just the same. I am expecting, however, for God to enable me to live a holy Bible life.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;I hope you may. I will now bid you goodbye. I am thankful for the talks I have had with you, and I say that I have been made no worse, at least. If there is anything better for me, I should like to have it. Goodbye.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Goodbye, Neighbor; God bless you and be with you in His mercy till we meet again.</p>

<p>(Mr. Synsum leaves.)</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;He is a good man in his way. Poor fellow, he has been taught, as many of us have, that we must of necessity sin more or less each day.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;Well, how are you getting along?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I am glad to tell you, Brother Wright, that I am saved. God forgave me last night. I am happy in His love today. I could scarcely keep from telling you and Mr. Synsum as soon as I came, but I want to get all those men together and tell them my experience. I hope it will do them some good.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I am glad you are saved, and I pray that your testimony will do those men much good. I think one or two of them are almost convinced that there is such a thing as having a present experience of salvation from sin by grace. Much depends upon our living. May God help us to live pure lives.</p>

<p>When you see those men, I wish you would tell them that Brother Goodman is going to preach in our schoolhouse on the first Sunday in next month, at 10:30 a.m., and that I send them a special invitation to come.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I shall be glad to tell them and insist on their coming. I shall go in my automobile after them and fetch them if they will come. Goodbye. I will be over often to see you. You and Sister Wright come over to visit us.</p>

<h1>Conversation 14</h1>

<p>(Mr. Truman meets with Messrs. Sumday, Works, Cicure, Synsum, and Waters.)</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Well, my dear friends and kind neighbors, I am glad to see you all together this morning. How are you?</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;As for me, I am feeling very well. How are you? You look as if you had some good news to tell.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I have been anxiously waiting to tell you what the Lord has done for me. For years, I have been seeking for what I have now found. I am saved. My sins are all under the blood. I am God&#8217;s child. I have found the peace and rest that Christ promised to give to those who come to Him.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;I am glad you have found what you have been wanting.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Yes, I long have wanted to be a Christian but did not know how. Some would say that salvation was by works, others that it was by water, and others that we could not have it at all, so I did not know what to do to obtain salvation. I regret, too, men, that I have not had a better example set before me by many of those who professed to be Christians. I am sure I would have been saved long ago if all professing Christians had lived as the Bible says they should live.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Well, now, since you have become a Christian, we shall look for a righteous example in you.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;By the help of God you shall find it.</p>

<p>O my brethren, why not love God with all intensity of soul and give proof of that love by the most careful obedience to His Word? I know that I am saved and that by grace through faith. I am expecting to be saved in the figurative sense by baptism when Brother Goodman comes next month, and then I expect to work out my salvation, and that, too, with fear and trembling, Mr. Cicure, lest I fall from grace.</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;I have no use for that Mr. Wright nor for his religion, and if you are going to follow him, you will soon be as big a fool as he is.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;I tell you, friends, while we may not all agree with him on the Bible, we must admit he is a most kind and obliging man. He is a neighbor in every sense of the word, and as for me, I will say that I wish I now lived as good a life as he does. The other day Widow Marshall&#8217;s cow broke the pasture fence down and got out upon the highway, and he left his own work to put the cow back and worked for nearly two hours fixing up her fence. And he would not take a cent for it.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;The other evening when I was over there, one of the boys coming from milking fell and spilled a whole pail of milk. Mr. Wright said in the kindest way, &#8220;You should be more careful, son, and you would save yourself the fall and the calves their supper.&#8221; He told me that God had saved him from anger so that he does not get angry anymore, and since that, I have been watching him. If a man on a farm can live without getting angry sometimes, he is, beyond doubt, something more than an ordinary man. He must have some supernatural help.</p>

<p>The other day, I was given a lesson that I shall not soon forget. I, with my little boy, was in the woods splitting wood. As I was about to strike, my axe caught on a small bush behind me pulling the bush over my head so that it struck me a smart blow in the face. It made me so mad that before I had time to think I said a bad word. My little boy looked at me seriously and said, &#8220;Papa, my Sunday school teacher said that if I used bad words, I would not go to heaven when I died. Can you use bad words and go to heaven just because you are big?&#8221; Gentlemen, I tell you I want to live better than I have been living. I want to set a better example before my boy. What if after all our years of profession we should miss heaven at last!</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;Well, you have a very weak religion, to be scared by the words of a boy and a man like Wright. I am saved, and when we once are in grace, we shall always be in grace. We shall never fall.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;I am not sure that I was ever in grace, but I would like to have the grace that Mrs. Wright has. As I was passing her home yesterday morning, she was hanging out her clothes and singing, &#8220;<a href="../../../music/Jesus_Lover_of_My_Soul/index.html" title="Jesus Lover of My Soul">Jesus, Lover of My Soul</a>.&#8221; All at once the clothesline broke and down came the clothes in the dirt, and to my greatest surprise, she never stopped singing. She had just gotten to the words:</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Other refuge have I none,
<br />Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;
<br />Leave, ah! leave me not alone,
<br />Still support and comfort me.
<br />All my trust on Thee is stayed,
<br />All my help from Thee I bring;
<br />Cover my defenseless head
<br />With the shadow of Thy wing.&#8221;</p>

<p>If ever words came from the soul of anyone, these came from her soul. I never saw anything else so much like heaven.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;But think how long we have belonged to church, and now to say that we have had no religion, or salvation, as Mr. Wright is pleased to call it, all these years, is more than I am willing to do.</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;I have no fears of falling from grace.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;No, I do not think you need have any fears. A man who is lying flat on the ground cannot fall.</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;I guess I am as good as any of you.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I have heard you men in your talks with Mr. Wright. It was plain to me that he was speaking according to the Bible. Now, since I am saved, I know he is right. I have found the rest that Christ promised to those who would come to Him. I exhort you all to give up your ways and turn to God.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;It seems to me that your advice is good. I think we all are confused and do not know just where we are.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Brother Wright asked me to invite you all over to his schoolhouse the first Sunday in next month at 10:30 a.m. Mr. Goodman is to preach, and Mr. Wright wants you all to come at least that one time.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;I shall certainly try to be there.</p>

<p>Mr. Synsum&#8212;I will come if I can.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;I guess it will not hurt me to go, so you may look for me.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;I shall be glad to hear him.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;What about you, Mr. Cicure, can you come?</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;Well, I could, I suppose, but I have better employment for my time.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I will come over in my automobile and take you, if you will go.</p>

<p>Mr. Cicure&#8212;Thank you, sir, but I would not go if you were to come in an airplane.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Well, I will look for you gentlemen over. Goodbye to you all.</p>

<h1>Conversation 15</h1>

<p>(Sermon preached by Mr. Goodman to a congregation including Mr. Wright and his neighbors.)</p>

<p>Brethren and kind friends:</p>

<p>The subject upon which I wish to speak to you this morning will doubtless appeal to you as wonderful. It is &#8220;God With Us.&#8221; My text is <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+1%3A23">Matthew 1:23</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Many of you here this morning are readers of history. You are well acquainted with the most wonderful happenings in all the ages of the world. History records the great things that have been wrought by the ingenuity of man. By his contrivances, we can talk with our friends in distant parts of the world; wireless messages can be sent for thousands of miles; voices of men can be heard long after they have been dead; the courses of stars and the distances they are from the earth are known, and the time when one shall cross the path of another can be reckoned centuries beforetime. Films have been invented that are more sensitive than the retina of the eye, so that distant stars that are invisible to the eye through the most powerful telescope have been pictured by the art of photography. The camera is made to analyze the movements of the swallow&#8217;s wing; by the spark of a Leyden jar, which is brighter than sunlight, a bullet discharged from a gun has been photographed, and the fast traveling bullet appears in the negative as if it were at rest. These, and hundreds of other things even more wonderful, you have read about.</p>

<p>In the little sketch of history I have read you this morning is recorded the most wonderful event that has ever happened in all the history of the world. It never occurred but once, it will never occur again. It lay wholly outside of the possibilities of man&#8212;a virgin with child. God came down to earth to be with mankind.</p>

<h3>Who Is God?</h3>
<p>See the small insect crawling in the dust at your feet. See the blade of grass, the leaf, the flower, the fields of grain, the forest, the flowing stream, the lofty mountain and the wide open plain. If you were to stand on the shore of the Pacific, you would see the waves leaping and dashing, and for thousands of miles, the water extends toward the setting sun. If you were to stand beneath the stars on a cloudless night, you would see the millions of the shining worlds and wonder at the vast distance between them. Then, think for a moment that God&#8212;the God that came down to be with men&#8212;is the maker and upholder of all&#8212;all things, from the tiniest insect to blazing suns&#8212;all is upheld by the hand of God.</p>

<h3>His Promises to Man</h3>
<p>Many years ago, God gave to man this promise: <span class="scripture">&#8220;And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again unto this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+28%3A15" title="Genesis 28:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 28:15)</span></a></span> The promise was not to Jacob only, because the Apostle encourages our hearts by telling us to <span class="scripture">&#8220;be content with such things as ye have; for he hath said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+13%3A5" title="Hebrews 13:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 13:5)</span></a></span> Jesus said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+28%3A20" title="Matthew 28:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 28:20)</span></a></span> Not only was He with the apostles to the end of their life, but He is with all His children and will continue to be with them so long as the world shalt stand.</p>

<p>But that Christ&#8212;God born of the virgin and manifest in the flesh&#8212;was for a long time not with us, yet after He came and before His ascension, He said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;I will not leave you comfortless; I will come to you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+14%3A18" title="John 14:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 14:18)</span></a></span> God, until the time of Christ, was with man as a Creator, caring for His creatures; in Christ, He was with man not only as a Creator caring for His creatures but also as a Savior; since Christ, He is with man in the person of the Holy Spirit, as the Creator caring for His creature as a Savior, and as an indwelling abiding comforter. He says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+6%3A16" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 6:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 6:16)</span></a></span> Then again, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+3%3A16-17" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 3:16-17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 3:16-17)</span></a></span> Wonderful! My brethren, if God dwells in you, you are holy, and if you are not holy, God does not dwell in you. Christ shed His blood that the soul of man might be cleansed from all sin and that it might be a fit dwelling place for God. This work is wrought not by water nor by works, but by grace through faith. Christ dwells in the heart by faith (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+3%3A17">Ephesians 3:17</a>).</p>

<h3>The Excellency of God&#8217;s Presence</h3>
<p>What can be of greater value to man in the journey of life than the presence of God with him? Life spent in the presence of God is a life of victory, a life of safety, a life of joy and peace. <span class="scripture">&#8220;In thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+16%3A11" title="Psalm 16:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 16:11)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;My presence shall go with thee,&#8221;</span> said the Lord to Moses, <span class="scripture">&#8220;and I will give thee rest.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Exodus+33%3A14" title="Exodus 33:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Exodus 33:14)</span></a></span> The expressions in the ninety-first psalm, <span class="scripture">&#8220;He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+91%3A1" title="Psalm 91:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 91:1)</span></a></span> and <span class="scripture">&#8220;He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+91%3A4" title="Psalm 91:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 91:4)</span></a></span> describe our privilege of living daily in His blessed presence. As the mother bird is ever present with her brood, her feathers sheltering them from the chilly wind and her wing protecting them, so God is ever present with His children, keeping them in safety.</p>

<h3>Consciousness of His Presence</h3>
<p>I will tell you the secret of a happy, joyful life. A friend might be present with us, but if we were not conscious of his presence we should not be greatly benefitted. He might give us protection unseen and unknown by us, but we could not be rejoiced. It is only when we are conscious of the presence of a friend that his presence gives us joy. And further, we are made conscious of the cheering presence of a friend by the same medium that we become conscious of the fragrant flower in the vases or the pleasing strains of music that we hear&#8212;by our physical senses; but we are made conscious of God&#8217;s presence with us by our spiritual senses. A feeling of loneliness may be creeping over the spirit of a husband as he sits alone in his room. His wife may enter all unobserved by him, but that does not dispel his loneliness. The moment, however, that she lays her gentle hand upon his shoulder, he is made conscious of her presence, and the lonely feeling leaves him. It is when we feel God touching our souls by His gentle Spirit that we are made conscious of His presence; joy flows like a river over our spirit. It is then that the soul is satisfied; it is then that it has peace and rest. O my friends, do you live each day in touch with God?</p>

<p>When we feel the touch of a friend&#8217;s hand, we are assured of his presence. When we feel the touch of God&#8217;s Spirit, we are assured of His presence, and, oh, what care we then for the pleasures of earth! When a soul is born again, it comes in touch with God. When we taste the delicious flavor of fruits; when we scent the rich fragrance of the flowers; when we hear melodious strains of music, we experience delight. When we are born of the Spirit, we get a sweet taste of the good things of God; we hear the voice of His Spirit whispering in our soul that we are God&#8217;s child; we scent fragrance from the fields of grace; we experience delight&#8212;such delight as nothing of this world can give.</p>

<p>My friends, we can and will if we walk in the light of God&#8217;s Word, have a blessed consciousness of God&#8217;s reality&#8212;of His presence with us. We may not at all times receive new evidences of God&#8217;s presence, but we shall often be made aware of His presence. We, as Christians, are to live a life of faith, and faith will always produce feelings of some sort; if we believe evil tidings, we have bad feelings; if we believe good tidings, we have good feelings. God may sometimes withdraw away from our sight; He may cease to speak to our souls; He may remove the touch of His hand from our spirit so that we cannot see, hear, or feel Him; but as we remember the promise, <span class="scripture">&#8220;I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+13%3A15" title="Hebrews 13:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 13:15)</span></a></span> we know that God is nevertheless present with us and we have rest, peace, and calm composure by faith in Him.</p>

<p>A husband may be sitting in his room conversing with his wife; he sees her; he hears her voice; he feels the touch of her hand. She says to him that she is going into another room to do some work but that she will not leave the house. Although he cannot see her, hear her, nor feel her, yet he believes her word to the effect that she will not leave the house. His faith makes him conscious of her presence, and he is contented. Should he begin to doubt her presence in the house, which he may do if, after a reasonable length of time, he does not receive some evidence of her presence, he will begin to feel restless. A Christian may not for a time see, hear, or feel God, yet by faith he knows that God is with him, and that faith gives him a consciousness of God&#8217;s presence. But who can blame anyone for beginning to doubt that God is present with him, if, after a reasonable length of time, he fails to see, hear, or feel any spiritual evidence of His presence? It may not be that we doubt God&#8217;s promises, but may be we have failed to obey some commandment. Beloved, in the very nature of things, we must often have some evidence of God&#8217;s presence&#8212;see, hear, or feel, spiritually&#8212;or we shall lose that precious consciousness of God&#8217;s reality, and the soul will begin to get restless.</p>

<p>Friend, does God dwell in your heart today? Do you feel Him there? Does His presence fill your soul with joy and satisfaction? If you do not have evidence of His presence, you have just reason to doubt that you are right with God. I exhort you to seek God until you know that He is in you.</p>

<p>Before I close, is there any announcement?</p>

<p>Mr. Wright&#8212;I wish to say that there will be a cottage prayer meeting at my house next Wednesday night and that everybody is cordially invited to be present.</p>

<p>Mr. Goodman&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+3%3A20-21" title="Ephesians 3:20-21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 3:20-21)</span></a></span></p>

<h1>Conversation 16</h1>

<p>(Wednesday morning.)</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Wife, I think I shall go to town this morning and may not be home for dinner.</p>

<p>Mrs. Truman&#8212;Very well, then; I will telephone to some of the neighbors who were not at meeting Sunday night and invite them to the prayer meeting tonight. Goodbye.</p>

<p>(Later, on his way home, Mr. Truman meets Mr. Works.)</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Praise the Lord! Brother Truman, I have been anxious to see you. Where have you been?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I have been to town. Have you something special to tell me or that you wished to see me about?</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Yes, sir! I could scarcely wait to tell you that the Lord has saved me from my sins, and I am very happy.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;You are saved! Well, I am certainly glad to hear it! I rejoice with you.</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Yes, that sermon Sunday night, though it was only an ordinary one, as some of my neighbors are saying, was to me the most heart-searching sermon I ever heard. The preacher&#8217;s words sank deep into my heart.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;When did you get saved&#8212;right after the service?</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;No; after I went home. When we arrived home that night, my wife was crying, and I had a very heavy burden on my soul. I knew that she was longing for the heartfelt religion that Brother Goodman told us of, and all the way home, I had been pondering over the matter, wondering if I should not have to give up my &#8220;works&#8221; theory and accept salvation by faith. My wife said, &#8220;Husband let us pray,&#8221; and we knelt down. Never before did I feel the weight of my sins as at that time. I was indeed miserable. If ever a man earnestly called upon God for mercy, I did; and then I came to the point where I just believed the Word as Brother Goodman said, and the light of heaven shone into my soul. Praise the Lord!</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;And you now believe in salvation by faith, after all, do you?</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Indeed I do; about the time my wife and children got the victory, we had a hallelujah time. That cured me of the &#8220;works&#8221; doctrine, as I used to believe it.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I suppose you can better understand now some of the explanations Mr. Wright gave us when we used to talk with him on that subject?</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Yes; at first my wife and I used to talk those things over after we would come back from Mr. Wright&#8217;s just to strengthen our belief in opposition to his, but our study on the subject led us to see that we were wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I hope a lot more of the people around here will study their Bibles until they see the error of some of their false doctrines. I am surely glad that so many have been touched by that sermon Sunday night. There was nothing very stirring about it apparently, but somehow the people are stirred for miles around.</p>

<p>Well, I shall see you at prayer meeting tonight?</p>

<p>Mr. Works&#8212;Yes, indeed; I can&#8217;t afford to miss it.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I must be going. Keep up good courage.</p>

<p>(Later, Mr. Truman meets Mr. Waters.)</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;A fine day, Mr. Truman. How are you?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I am well and saved. A few minutes ago, I met Brother Works, and he was telling me about how he and his household got saved Sunday night.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Yes, I heard about it. There is quite a talk in the neighborhood about the matter, and it seems that our conversations with Mr. Wright are known all over the neighborhood, and a good many heard Brother Goodman preach the other night.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;While in town today, I learned that there is no little stir on the subject of religion. I believe there will be a good attendance at the prayer service tonight. By the way, I did not see Mr. Cicure at the meeting Sunday night.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;No; he was not in the audience; but I learned that he was sitting on the fence near the house and so close to the window that he could hear every word that was spoken. I understand, too, that he told one of the neighbors who was with him that the preacher and all who go to hear him preach ought to be horsewhipped and that he himself would not be seen with such a crowd.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Well, well! I believe that man is interested after all. I hope the Lord will save his soul. I think there must be something good about the man regardless of his obstinacy, although I am told that he is very mean to his family and to some of his neighbors at times. You know Saul of Tarsus at one time was a great opposer of just such teaching and of just such people, and he afterwards became a good man.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Say, I want to tell you that I am no longer an opposer. After I heard that sermon, I felt my need, as never before, of having a real experience. I became awakened to the fact that I was lost in sin and that I had only an empty profession that could not take me to heaven, and so I am now saved by grace.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Well, you do not know how glad I am to hear that you are saved! Did you have a hallelujah time as Mr. Works had?</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Not exactly. I had a hard struggle praying through to victory. Do you know, I had to give up my &#8220;water salvation&#8221; theory before I could get help from the Lord? When I yielded that point and gave up my sins, the Lord spoke peace to my soul, and I am now ready to be baptized according to the Word.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Does Mr. Wright know about that?</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Not that I know of; but I want you to tell him if you go around that way home.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Indeed I shall go around that road, even though it is a mile farther; for I know he will rejoice to hear about you and Mr. Works. You know he has been praying almost night and day for you.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Well, God bless that man! He is a good man&#8212;and we all knew it all these years, but some of us were too proud to admit it.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I wonder what Mr. Sumday is working at over there. There is another man we have been praying for.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Yes, and I have some good news from him for you.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Tell me quick!</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;About nine o&#8217;clock this morning, he was here and told me that he intended to make a public statement in the prayer meeting tonight and request prayer for his salvation.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;You don&#8217;t say! How Mr. Wright will rejoice when he hears that!</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;He knows it already. Mr. Sumday was over to see him before breakfast this morning&#8212;he stopped here on his way back.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;What is he going to say?</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Well, he has become so convicted of his need of salvation that he has been glad to drop all opposition, and he feels that it will help him to pray through if he gets up and confesses that he has been in error. He believes he will get saved at the meeting tonight.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Say, won&#8217;t we have a good meeting then! I hope the whole neighborhood will be there.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;There will be a crowd all right; the talk is going everywhere; but Mr. Synsum received a telegram from his son, and went away yesterday.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Well, I hope he will be able to return before very long; Mr. Wright has been telling me that the time is ripe for a general revival in this community, and I believe, as usual, he is right about it. I hope that evangelist that is coming next Sunday with Brother Goodman will stay for a few weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Yes, I think he will. I noticed a news item in the morning paper announcing that a revival would begin next Sunday afternoon. Mr. Synsum will most likely return before it is over.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;When will that baptismal service be?</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;At four o&#8217;clock on Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;And you are going to be there?</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Yes, I am going to be baptized.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;You? Weren&#8217;t you baptized years ago?</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;I went through a form of baptism, but my heart was not right, therefore I was not a true Scriptural candidate. No one has told me that I should be baptized now; but after I studied that text, <span class="scripture">&#8220;He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+16%3A16" title="Mark 16:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 16:16)</span></a></span> I became so forcibly impressed with the idea that believing must precede baptism that I decided to obey the text to the letter.</p>

<p>(Mr. Sumday comes to talk.)</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;How are you, gentlemen?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;We were just wondering what you were doing over there?</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;I saw you talking so long that I decided to come and tell you how I feel. Somehow, the nearer I get to God the closer I feel to you good people. I tell you if I don&#8217;t soon get help, I don&#8217;t know what will become of me. I just can&#8217;t work anymore&#8212;everywhere I go, this burden presses me.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;That&#8217;s just the way I felt; but keep on praying.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;Somehow I have been thinking I would get through at the prayer meeting tonight when all those good people will help me pray. I&#8217;ll have to get help soon. This thing of waiting to get salvation beyond the vale of death doesn&#8217;t satisfy me anymore, especially since I was over to see Mr. Cicure.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;What happened over there&#8212;did he horsewhip you?</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;What do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;I heard that he said anyone who went to hear Brother Goodman preach ought to be horsewhipped.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;Well, he is under such conviction that he can scarcely rest. He is feeling almost as bad as I am; that&#8217;s why I left him. I knew that we could not comfort each other.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters&#8212;Will he come to the meeting tonight too?</p>

<p>Mr. Sumday&#8212;No; he knows he ought to come, but he is not willing to yield. That is one reason why he is feeling so burdened.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Oh, but I do hope he will not resist the Spirit and harden his heart. Since reading in family worship, I have been very deeply impressed with these words of Jesus: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Walk in the light while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+12%3A35" title="John 12:35"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 12:35)</span></a></span></p>

<h1>Conversation 17</h1>

<p>(After prayer meeting Wednesday night)</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;My dear wife, I wish you could have been at prayer meeting tonight. That was the most glorious meeting I have ever attended in all my life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Truman&#8212;Yes; all evening I wished that I had gone. I almost felt miserable because I let that little work keep me away.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Well, you surely missed a good meeting.</p>

<p>Mrs. Truman&#8212;Next time, I&#8217;ll know better. I promised the Lord on my knees that I would not let such a thing happen again&#8212;and I felt better after I had made that decision. Was Mrs. Wright there?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Yes; and how happy she was! Such a prayer as she prayed! It seemed to melt the whole audience.</p>

<p>Mrs. Truman&#8212;Who preached?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Well, no one really preached; Mr. Wright read the <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+107">107th Psalm</a> and commented on some of the verses. You just ought to have heard him!</p>

<p>Mrs. Truman&#8212;What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Some of the verses he especially commented on read something like this: <span class="scripture">&#8220;They wandered in the wilderness&#8230;. Hungry and thirsty&#8230;. They cried unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> in their trouble&#8230;. And he led them forth by the right way.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+107%3A4-7" title="Psalm 107:4-7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 107:4-7)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Truman&#8212;And how did he apply that text?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Apply it? He did not need to apply it. Whatever the Psalmist may have had in mind when he wrote, we all knew how it fitted us exactly. There was Mr. Waters and Mr. Works and the rest of us&#8212;we knew what we had suffered in our spiritual wilderness; and then to think that we had at last found deliverance <span class="scripture">&#8220;by the right way&#8221;</span>! Mrs. Wright&#8217;s face shone like an angel&#8217;s. You could not help feeling that she was filled with the Spirit of God. Then, when Brother Wright read that verse where it says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;He <i>satisfieth</i> the longing soul,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;q= the longing soul " title=""><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> ()</span></a></span> putting the emphasis on the word <i>satisfieth</i>, Mr. Sumday broke down and wept.</p>

<p>Mrs. Truman&#8212;Did he get the victory?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Yes; after the reading of the Psalm, we had prayer (two prayed); then they sung that hymn, &#8220;Light is Breaking in upon My Soul.&#8221; After that hymn, Mr. Sumday asked permission to speak, which Mr. Wright eagerly granted. He told the people how he had always opposed the idea of having a present experience of salvation, believing that someday he would find &#8220;sweet peace on the sunny banks of the river in the world to come.&#8221; But during the last few days, he said he had changed his mind completely. He has been so deeply convicted of his lost condition that he was glad to yield. He said, too, that that meeting Sunday was enough to convince anyone of a present salvation. He asked us all to pray for him. Before we could get on our knees, several others were on their feet also asking prayer&#8212;two of them were young people whom I do not know.</p>

<p>You didn&#8217;t have to coax Mr. Sumday to pray. He prayed so earnestly that it made people feel the need of salvation, and he soon got the victory.</p>

<p>Mrs. Truman&#8212;Who was the other person that prayed before Mr. Sumday spoke?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Why&#8230;&#8203;your husband.</p>

<p>Mrs. Truman&#8212;You? You?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Yes, I used to think I never could do it; but I found that when I became real deeply interested in souls, it was not so hard to pray in public after all. All I had to do was to start, and then my soul unburdened itself. I don&#8217;t expect it will always be so easy to pray; but I made up my mind that I will always do my duty, no matter how hard it may seem.</p>

<p>Mrs. Truman&#8212;God help you in your decision. That is one reason why you feel so happy, and why Brother Wright&#8217;s talk seemed so good to you.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Well, I hadn&#8217;t thought of it in just that way; but since I come to think of it, it must be true. So that is the secret of always being able to enjoy a meeting&#8212;I&#8217;ve learned that much since coming home.</p>

<p>Mrs. Truman&#8212;Is the evangelist coming next Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Yes; so Mr. Wright announced. And that series of meetings is surely going to be a success. The way this neighborhood is stirred up, even to Mr. Cicure, and the way the Lord is working through His people, as in the prayer meeting tonight, convinces me that there is no question about its success. Mr. Wright urged us all to pray earnestly for the revival and to invite all our neighbors.</p>

<p>Mrs. Truman&#8212;It will not be difficult to get our neighbors to go. Brother and Sister Wright have always made everyone feel welcome; you simply enjoy being near them.</p>

<p>Mr. Truman&#8212;Yes, I believe there is a drawing-power about all devoted Christians. Somehow one feels a satisfaction in associating with them that he can&#8217;t feel among worldly people, especially if his soul is yearning for salvation. And the closer we live to God, the more we feel at home when we meet with the people of God.</p>
