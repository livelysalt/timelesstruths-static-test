<h1>Northern Indiana Eldership</h1>

<p>The pagan system of Freemasonry began to make inroads in the body of Christians known as the Indiana Eldership of the Church of God. A storm of opposition arose from some who were of the more spiritual element of the Church when a number of the members became affiliated with the Masonic Lodge. It appears that the main body of the Eldership did not object to secret societies, and the result of the agitation was that a number of ministers who stood for the opposition and refused to fellowship Freemasons were expelled from the Eldership and were denied a renewal of their licenses. Others left the body of their own accord. In consequence a new Eldership was formed called the Northern Indiana Eldership.</p>

<p>Among those who constituted the original members of the new Eldership were Elders J. Martin, J. S. Shock, C. Clem, E. B. Bell, B. F. Bear, I. W. Lowman, and J. W. Ray. The new body came into possession of most of the church property and the best churches. They appointed a Board of Publication, which took steps to begin publishing a paper devoted to the interests of the cause for which they stood. Accordingly there appeared in January 1878, the first number of the <i>Herald of Gospel Freedom</i>, a monthly periodical published from Wolcottville, Indiana, at fifty cents a year. It stood for the promotion of gospel truth and freedom, opposition to all oath-bound secret societies, Freemasonry in particular, and loyalty to God and conformity to his Word. I. W. Lowman was editor.</p>

<p>At the Eldership meeting which convened at Beaver Dam on October 5, 1878, and which was the third annual session, Brother Warner was voted a member. In his diary for October 5 appears this account of the proceedings:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first"><b>5.</b> A good deal of time was given to prayer during the day. Much unnecessary business usually gone through with in the various Elderships was dispensed with. All went off smoothly and with love. Not a grating word or discordant note in all that was said and done. No one was called to order; no one was materially out of order. The manner in which business was done and the good degree of devotional spirit with which it was pervaded was a great stride from the carnal and formal wranglings of Elderships of the present to the simplicity and spirituality of an apostolic Eldership. Praise God, he is leading his children out into the glorious freedom of the gospel.</p>

<p>The most of the time was devoted to the publishing interests. A very important measure was enacted&#8212;that of enlarging the <i>Herald</i>, issuing it semi-monthly and devoting a part of it to the promotion of Bible holiness. Praise God for this glorious movement. It is wonderful how he is controlling things for his glory. Probably a large majority of the Eldership are not in the experience of full salvation, and of course some are disbelievers in it, among whom are some of the preachers. Brother Shock, one of the number, the present speaker, is probably our most talented man. But all glory to the name of God, he controlled all these elements so that Satan could not move one to open his mouth against this work of God, and this Eldership voted to support holiness as a second experience. Trusting in God, I can see glorious results from this project. It is bringing about what the Lord showed me last winter; that is, a people straight before God in holiness and truth. By this blessed little organ God is going to bring the true church foundation and Bible truth into the hands of holiness people, and holiness doctrine into the hands of Church of God members, which must result in a divine union of truth and holiness. And this is just what is wanted to save the world. Holiness, the great lever of power, has since the Reformation been weakened and encumbered by party names and creeds and human traditions; whereas the Church of God, though established upon eternal truth, has nevertheless been without strength to accomplish her mission for the want of perfect holiness, the divinely appointed power to bring the world to God.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>At this session of the Eldership, as Brother Warner says, special attention was given to the Eldership&#8217;s paper, the <i>Herald of Gospel Freedom</i>. During its first year it had been a 10 by 15 four-column folio. It was now increased in size to a five-column 13 by 20. It was made a semi-monthly and its subscription price advanced to seventy-five cents. Lowman was reelected editor and publisher, and Brother Warner was elected associate editor to conduct a new holiness department. A number of special contributors were chosen. A music department, already established and conducted by Professor J. F. Kinsey, of Cincinnati, was to be continued. The best exchanges were secured, and with this prospect the paper started on its second year, 1879. A portion of the prospectus for that year is here given.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>Prospectus of <i>The Herald</i> for 1879</h3>
<p>This paper was started one year ago as the organ of the Northern Indiana Eldership of the Church of God, a body of Christian workers who were raised up through the following circumstances:</p>

<p>Several ministers of the Church of God in Indiana through a scrupulous regard for truth and righteousness refused to fellowship men who were yoked together in the dark leagues of secrecy. For thus reproving the works of darkness their licenses were withheld. Accordingly through the providence of God and the force of circumstances they formed themselves together as an independent body, recognizing God as the founder of his own Church and all true Christians as her real membership.</p>

<p>The Bible is their only creed, and Christian character their only test of fellowship.</p>

<p>The labors of this little band have been signally blessed of God, and their members increased.</p>

<p>The <i>Herald</i>, all things considered, has been a decided success. At the recent session of the Eldership Elder I. W. Lowman was reelected Editor and Elder Warner was elected Associate Editor.</p>

<p>As heretofore, it shall be the aim of the <i>Herald</i> to <span class="scripture">&#8220;earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jude+1%3A3" title="Jude 1:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jude 1:3)</span></a></span> not a part, but the whole faith of the gospel, ignoring the traditions of men, reproving the works of darkness and enforcing all the will of God.</p>

<p>It believes in raising men to the Bible standard of holy living by leading them into the Bible measure of grace.</p>

<p>It advocates a salvation that lifts men above the regions of mere duty and places them in such sweet and perfect harmony with God that they delight to do his will; a salvation that constrains to every good work by the infinite power of perfect love, and not by the lash of the law.</p>

<p>Viewed from a human standpoint the <i>Herald</i> may appear to possess two separate features; namely, that of an organ of the Church of God, and an advocate of holiness. But viewed from a pure Bible standpoint these distinct features naturally blend into one effort to restore and propagate the pure religion of the Bible.</p>

<p><i>Church</i> signifies &#8220;called out.&#8221; The divinely given title, Church of God, therefore denotes the called out of God, or separated unto God. <i>Holiness</i> means the same thing; that is, to be separated from all sin and wholly given up to God.</p>

<p>The editors of the <i>Herald</i> firmly believe that apostolic truths and Bible holiness cannot be separated.</p>

<p>The work of holiness has been too long encumbered by human creeds and disintegrated parties among its friends.</p>

<p>Though holiness as a distinct experience is the most precious and important truth of the gospel, its wonderful triumphs have been much limited and rendered comparatively unstable for the want of being identified with all other Bible truths and divested of human systems.</p>

<p>Upon the other hand, the Church, ever accepting the only infallible and divinely authorized standard of discipline, and wearing the only church title that was &#8220;given by the mouth of the Lord,&#8221; is utterly disqualified to perform her appointed mission in bringing the world to God unless she be girded with the invincible power of perfect holiness and the full and distinct baptism of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Truth is mighty; but holiness, being the fullness of God in man, is almighty. The union of these divine forces, we believe, will make a complete conquest of this world for God.</p>

<p>To restore the divine plan in the harmonious action and the spread of these elements of salvation is the primary object of the <i>Herald</i>.</p>

<p>A part of the paper will therefore be devoted especially to that doctrine and experience of entire sanctification, to be conducted by the Associate Editor, the Editor-in-Chief being also fully in line with holiness definitely through the blood.</p>

<p>With an unshaken trust in God, and confiding in the integrity of our cause and the support of all lovers of truth and Christian purity, we begin Volume II of the <i>Herald</i> in the name of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class="signature">I. W. Lowman,<br />Editor and Publisher.</p>

<p class="signature">D. S. Warner,<br />Associate Editor.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>An entry from the dairy, dated October 7, contains an interesting item and will close this chapter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">As I arose this morning and approached the Lord, I was led to ask my heavenly Father for some means, as I was entirely destitute, having been just able to pay my ticket fare here by the addition of a postage stamp, which through the kind providence of God I happened to have and the agent was kind enough to take. I came down, washed, and took my little morning walk for exercise and meditation, returned, and as soon as seated Father M. said, &#8220;I feel impressed that I should give this brother some money and I believe we all ought.&#8221; He handed me a half dollar and the several brethren all followed with half dollars and quarters. Glory, honor, thanks, and praises be unto God our Savior forever and ever Oh, bless the Lord, my soul, who supplieth all my needs according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus!</p>
