<h1>A Spiritual Shaking</h1>

<p>In his book <i>Bible Proofs of the Second Work of Grace</i>, Brother Warner devotes three chapters to the prophetic description of the great work of restoration in the latter times, when, through the preaching of holiness and the upholding of the full Scriptural standard of truth, God should bring His people into unity again. This chapter is intended as an abridgement of the three chapters referred to.</p>

<p>I wish to say by way of introduction that many of the events in the history of ancient Israel are figures of and have their counterpart in things occurring in the Christian dispensation. And many of the utterances of the prophets, associated primarily with the events of those times, have their fulfillment as well in connection with the things foreshadowed. To regard these prophetic writings as referring only and finally to the literal affairs of the people of the Old Testament is to stop far short of their intention and use. The old dispensation was preparatory of the new. It was full of types and figures of things to be realized in the latter. Everything pointed forward in anticipation of the fullness of times when God should establish His new and better covenant with His people. Shall we say then that the prophecies did not share this anticipation&#8212;that they had to do only with the literal figures? Nay, it was the spirit of prophesy more than anything else that foretold of the times of the gospel dispensation, not only by direct reference, but also in many of those passages which touched first those immediate affairs in Israel&#8217;s career and through them those greater things farther on. We note how the New Testament writers picked up the Old Testament prophecies and applied them, with such reference as &#8220;that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet,&#8221; or, &#8220;as it is written,&#8221; etc.</p>

<p>But let us not suppose that the applications of prophecy were to he confined to the days of Christ and the apostles. Many things were said of David and other Old Testament objects that had their extended and more important fulfillment in Christ or in the establishment of the church, but there were other utterances that had their final import in the later affairs of the New Testament kingdom. Those that cluster about the captivity of Israel in Babylon and their reestablishment in their own land and the rebuilding of Jerusalem are especially rich in secondary application to the corresponding crises in the history of the church.</p>

<p>It is thus that many of the prophecies have a twofold application, not that they mean two different things, but that they apply to both the literal and spiritual phases of the same thing. A sufficient proof of this lies in the fact that in the Revelation, where their spiritual meaning is assumed, we find the same Old Testament figures. There is unity of purpose in God&#8217;s system of types and figures and in His plan throughout, and hence many of the prophecies that pertained in the first place to events in the history of Israel are used by the Spirit today in connection with the antitypes of those events.</p>

<p>Great epochal events or changes in which God by some particular institution unfolds His plan, or in which there is involved the divine approach to man, whether for approval or for judgment, are attended more or less by violent manifestations in the earth or the elements. Thus on the occasion of the giving of the law at Mount Sinai the mountain shook and smoked and there were thunders and lightnings, and the people trembled. At the crucifixion of Christ, the central event in all history, the sun hid his face and the earth shook, the rocks were rent and graves were opened. The Pentecostal outpouring of the Holy Spirit was with the sound of <span class="scripture">&#8220;a rushing mighty wind.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+2%3A2" title="Acts 2:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 2:2)</span></a></span> When the apostolic church prayed for the special endowment of divine power, <span class="scripture">&#8220;the place was shaken where they were assembled together, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+4%3A31" title="Acts 4:31"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 4:31)</span></a></span> When the imprisoned Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises to God, the divine response came with a great earthquake which shook the foundations of the prison, opened all doors, and loosed everyone&#8217;s bands. On the day of final judgment the very earth will be moved out of her place and the elements will manifest the awful day of God.</p>

<p>The shaking of things, as accompanying the divine visitation, is also taken in the spiritual, or figurative, phase, and it is this application of the idea of shaking as used in the Scripture that Brother Warner employs in reference to the great spiritual movement of these latter times. As a key to the prophecies on this subject he uses <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A25-29">Hebrews 12:25-29</a>, which reads as follows:</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven: Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven. And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain. Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear: For our God is a consuming fire.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A25-29" title="Hebrews 12:25-29"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 12:25-29)</span></a></span></p>

<p>We have here two distinct shakings. The first one, according to the apostle&#8217;s words beginning with <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A18">verse 18</a>, plainly refers to the manifestation at Sinai when the first covenant was given to Israel (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Exodus+19">Exodus 19</a>). The second shaking attends the voice which in this dispensation speaks from heaven. The former was a literal shaking, while the latter is of course spiritual, and attends the establishment of the new covenant. <span class="scripture">&#8220;See that ye refuse not him that speaketh&#8221;</span> is in the present tense to this dispensation and is an injunction for us.</p>

<p>Now, the new covenant involves the very highest standard of relation between God and His people, a standard much superior to that of the old Sinaitic covenant. It is distinguished by the laws of God being written in our hearts and comprehends our perfect obedience to them. In this relation we become His people and He our God in the very closest sense (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+8%3A10%3B+10%3A16">Hebrews 8:10; 10:16</a>). This relation is none other than entire sanctification, which to attain requires the complete crucifixion of the self-life, the destruction of every idol, and entire abandonment to God. It is a close-girding covenant and admits of no sin either in practice or in the heart. The words <span class="scripture">&#8220;yet once more&#8221;</span> refer to the shaking as final and to the standard of truth as being perfect, <i>ne plus ultra</i>, and as therefore consisting only of things unshakable.</p>

<p>It is the voice calling to this holiness standard of the new covenant that produces the mighty shaking, causing both earth and heaven to tremble. Whenever this voice is heard, whether in the beginning of Christianity or in a movement that effects the reestablishment of the new covenant in the hearts of God&#8217;s people today, the shaking occurs. Both sinners and professors are made to tremble at God&#8217;s mighty truth and he who would obey the divine appeal must suffer the shaking loose and consequent loss of all things contrary to the divine will, however dear they may be in the selfish affections. God has through grace made it possible for one and all to measure to this standard, so that for him who refuses the voice that speaks thus from high heaven there is positively no escape.</p>

<p>Our quotation from Hebrews leads us back to the prophet Haggai, whose words in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Haggai+2%3A6">chapter 2, verse 6</a>, are what the apostle doubtless refers to. This introduces us to that field of prophecies relating to the captivity and the return, so typical of the apostasy and of the final restoration of the true church in these last days. It should not be a thing incredible that the great spiritual events of these epoch-making times should be in accordance with prophetic utterance, nor that the Holy Spirit should lead Brother Warner, as he testifies to having been led, into these things as prophetic truth. Indeed the reader, if he be a seeker after truth, should not be surprised to find the Holy Spirit confirming to his own mind that these things have a prophetic illumination. Brother Warner&#8217;s reference to these prophesies, and his comments, are here given. Of <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A25-29">Hebrews 12:25-29</a> he thus speaks:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">On the 30th of August 1879, the Holy Spirit in a special manner gave me the foregoing scripture. I had never clearly comprehended its meaning and I felt impressed that the Lord was about to lead me into a new vein of truth. I shut myself up with God and the Bible, when <span class="scripture">&#8220;the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+14%3A26" title="John 14:26"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 14:26)</span></a></span> took most of the things that are contained in what follows and showed them to me. Being fully assured that my mind had been led into the pure light of truth, we published it from the pulpit, much to the edification of the holy brethren. We feel confident that the following chain of Scriptures, correlative with our text, will conduct every meek and candid reader into the same light it has your humble servant. We shall find the foregoing words of the inspired apostle a key to the prophetic description of the great work of holiness&#8230;.</p>

<p>Let us examine the same declaration elsewhere in the Holy Book. <span class="scripture">&#8220;According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not. For thus saith the Lord of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; and I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Haggai+2%3A5-7" title="Haggai 2:5-7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Haggai 2:5-7)</span></a></span> The rebuilding of the temple is the subject under consideration. This ancient abode of the great Shekinah was such a marked figure of the church of God that it is seldom spoken of by the holy seers but what the spirit of prophecy flashes forth in interspersed references to the &#8220;spiritual house.&#8221; Says the prophet, <span class="scripture">&#8220;The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the Lord of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord of hosts.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Haggai+2%3A9" title="Haggai 2:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Haggai 2:9)</span></a></span> Is it not in the midst of His church where God speaks peace to thousands who seek His face? Let us also thank God for the gracious intimation that the glory of the restored, latter-day church shall exceed that which preceded the dark-age captivity.</p>

<p>It is quite evident that the words in verses 5-7 were in the mind of the apostle when he wrote the words of our text. And we find here additional evidence that the <span class="scripture">&#8220;once more shaking&#8221;</span> relates to the triumphs of the gospel, because it is associated with the coming of Christ, not as Judge, but the <span class="scripture">&#8220;desire [or Savior] of all nations.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>God never designed that we should</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Roam through weary years
<br />Of inbred sin and doubts and fears,
<br />A bleak and toilsome wilderness.&#8221;</p>

<p>If you have not passed through the Jordan, the death convulsions of the &#8220;old man&#8221; of sin, to the Canaan rest, it is because you have either ignorantly or willfully <span class="scripture">&#8220;refused him that speaketh,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A25" title="Hebrews 12:25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 12:25)</span></a></span> and <span class="scripture">&#8220;entered not in because of unbelief.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A6" title="Hebrews 4:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 4:6)</span></a></span>&#8230;&#8203;</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;I will fill this house with glory.&#8221;</span> Here is the glory that Christ gives: <span class="scripture">&#8220;The Spirit of glory and of God,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+4%3A14" title="I&nbsp;Peter 4:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 4:14)</span></a></span> that fills and rests upon the church when inbred sin and all weights are shaken out. What is here associated with the <span class="scripture">&#8220;once more&#8221;</span> shaking corresponds with entire sanctification.</p>

<p>The prophet Ezekiel gives us a very interesting chain of concurring prophecy. Who with his spiritual eyes open can fail to see the application of the <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=34th+chapter+of+Ezekiel">34th chapter of Ezekiel</a> to the ministry, in general, of this age? They <span class="scripture">&#8220;[eat] up the good pasture&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+34%3A18" title="Ezekiel 34:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ezekiel 34:18)</span></a></span>&#8212;fare sumptuously on fat salaries. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Ye&#8230;&#8203;tread down&#8230;&#8203;the residue of your pastures&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+34%3A18" title="Ezekiel 34:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ezekiel 34:18)</span></a></span> and <span class="scripture">&#8220;foul the [waters] with your feet.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+34%3A18" title="Ezekiel 34:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ezekiel 34:18)</span></a></span> They are the real cause of spiritual famine instead of the means of refreshing the flock. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+34%3A3" title="Ezekiel 34:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ezekiel 34:3)</span></a></span> Make a lucrative merchandise of your Christless sermons, instead of administering the free gospel of salvation. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+34%3A3" title="Ezekiel 34:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ezekiel 34:3)</span></a></span> When any find their way to the true Shepherd and receive food, life, and holy fire in their souls, they annoy the dead and sleeping, who proceed at once to kill them. This is no idle fancy. It is an undeniable fact that in most of our present-day churches a real convert can scarcely maintain spiritual life.

<p>In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+35">Ezekiel 35</a> we have the judgment of mount Seir. Seir&#8212;<i>rough, shaggy</i>&#8212;we presume is used [in the typical sense] to denote the Catholic power.</p>

<p>It was inhabited by the Edomites, the descendants of Esau, who were therefore brothers with Israel, the descendants of Jacob; but the Edomites had a deep-rooted and perpetual enmity against Israel, they harassed and distressed them by all possible means. (See Adam Clark.) <span class="scripture">&#8220;Behold, O mount Seir, I am against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate&#8230;.

<p>As the spirit of prophecy uses mount Seir to represent Catholicism in chapter 35, and the Caucasian mountains [Gog and Magog, see Bible dictionary] to represent sectism in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+38-39">chapters 38 and 39</a>, so in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+36%3A1">chapter 36:1</a> the <span class="scripture">&#8220;mountains of Israel&#8221;</span> are used to represent the true conscientious Christians.

They have so long submitted to the world in the church, so long fawned and pampered sin under the cloak of religion, that a terrible conflict ensues whenever it is attacked by the sword of the Spirit. This crisis is described in the two following chapters, namely, <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+38+and+39">Ezekiel 38 and 39</a>.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him, and say, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+38%3A2-3" title="Ezekiel 38:2-3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ezekiel 38:2-3)</span></a></span> The Bible dictionary applies Gog and Magog to the Caucasian mountains, a chain that extends from the Black Sea to the Caspian. The Scythians of those regions were a fierce and warlike people. For many years they had made their name a terror to the whole Eastern world. They were finally conquered and driven out, B.C. 596, a few years before the time of Ezekiel&#8217;s prophesy. These events being fresh in the mind of the ancient seer, the prophetic spirit employs Gog and Magog to represent the acrid and intolerable spirit of sectarianism and its final overthrow.</p>

<p>Meshech and Tubal, allies of Gog, are noticed in history as &#8220;the remotest and rudest nations of the world.&#8221; David, it is probable, spoke prophetically of the same contentious, unsanctified zeal: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech&#8230;. My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace. I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+120%3A5-7" title="Psalm 120:5-7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 120:5-7)</span></a></span></p>

<p>In applying the army of Gog and Magog to the false, deceived, and sectarian forces, the enemies of the Lord&#8217;s true and holy church, I am clearly sustained in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+20%3A8-10">Revelation 20:8-10</a>, where they are declared to have been deceived by the devil, therefore have a spurious religion-are professors. &#8220;They compass the saints on the breadth of the earth&#8221;&#8212;hence are diffused throughout all nations and everywhere arrayed against the holy&#8212;but shall be finally destroyed by fire from heaven.

<p>God sets the testimony of his anointed against the worldly churches. Gog in return makes war upon them.

Let the battle rage, though the heavens and the earth be moved. Send down the fire, O Lord, send fire from heaven, and burn every Gog-schism out of the church!

<p>The burning of the weapons and burying of Gog is described as the cleansing of the land&#8212;the church.

And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?&#8221;</span> Here is a trying ordeal, a judgmental shaking of the church parallel with that described in Hebrews. It is the execution of Christ&#8217;s verdict of death to sin in the flesh. <span class="scripture">&#8220;The time is come.&#8221;</span> Scriptures thus introduced almost invariably refer to some previous prediction. In the prophecies of Isaiah we find what is doubtless the antecedent of Peter&#8217;s words: <span class="scripture">&#8220;I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin&#8230;&#8203;afterwards thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city. Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+1%3A25-27" title="Isaiah 1:25-27"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 1:25-27)</span></a></span></p>

<p>The judgment of Zion, the house of God, is her full redemption. It is the hand of the Almighty &#8220;purely purging away the dross and all the tin&#8221; from His church, that it might be called <span class="scripture">&#8220;The city of righteousness.&#8221;</span> This experience is not for the sinner, nor is it confined to the aged and dying; but the <span class="scripture">&#8220;converts&#8221;</span> in Zion, saith the Lord, shall be redeemed from sin, by the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning. This purging is parallel with the removing of those things that are shaken.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;In that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious [i.e., <span class="scripture">&#8216;sanctified and cleansed, a glorious church&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A26-27" title="Ephesians 5:26-27"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 5:26-27)</span></a></span>], and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel [have <span class="scripture">&#8216;escaped the corruption that is in the world&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+1%3A4" title="II&nbsp;Peter 1:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 1:4)</span></a></span>]. And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem: when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+4%3A2-4" title="Isaiah 4:2-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 4:2-4)</span></a></span> This explains the words of Peter very clearly; the judgment of the house of God is a divine washing and purging. The church, having passed through the spirit of judgment and of burning, all that are left therein <span class="scripture">&#8220;shall be called holy.&#8221;</span> Therefore, we understand the words of Peter as having reference to the sin-consuming flames of the Sanctifier, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, which corresponds with the shaking of the church, of which Paul speaks in Hebrews; for he concludes by saying, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Our God is a consuming fire.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A29" title="Hebrews 12:29"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 12:29)</span></a></span></p>

The hand of the Almighty is upon His church, and He will smite and humble it with His judgments; shake it with His voice from heaven, and consume it with the flames of His Spirit until every foul spirit is driven out and all the <span class="scripture">&#8220;works of the devil&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+3%3A8" title="I&nbsp;John 3:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 3:8)</span></a></span> destroyed; that nothing may remain but the pure, unalloyed elements of the divine kingdom, <span class="scripture">&#8220;which cannot be shaken.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A27" title="Hebrews 12:27"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 12:27)</span></a></span> No wonder the churches so often fear and dread the coming of God&#8217;s holy bands; yea, <span class="scripture">&#8220;a fire devoureth before them,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Joel+2%3A3" title="Joel 2:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Joel 2:3)</span></a></span> which quite frequently closes all meeting houses and every other place where the sects can defeat their access. It is because they know that they are but a collection of ecclesiastical stubble, which cannot abide the fire which accompanies the Lord&#8217;s army of definite witnesses.

<p>Let us now trace the heaven- and earth-shaking hosts of the Almighty in the prophet Isaiah. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+12%3A6" title="Isaiah 12:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 12:6)</span></a></span> Here is the power that does the shaking. A church that has the great and Holy One in her midst always produces a commotion in the world.</p>

<p>But who are required to do these things? Thus saith the Lord, <span class="scripture">&#8220;I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+13%3A3" title="Isaiah 13:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 13:3)</span></a></span> The sanctified soul rejoices only in the exaltation and glory of God; there is no principle left in the heart that seeks self-aggrandizement. They even glory in being abased, if God is thereby honored. Glory to His name!</p>

<p>Now observe the effect of lifting high the banner of holiness: <span class="scripture">&#8220;The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the Lord of Hosts mustereth the host of the battle.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+13%3A4" title="Isaiah 13:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 13:4)</span></a></span> A commotion soon follows the definite testimony and &#8220;lifting up of holy hands in the sanctuary&#8221; (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+134%3A2">Psalm 134:2</a>) of the Lord: an army springs into existence; God Himself mustereth the host. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Howl ye; for the day of the Lord is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty. Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man&#8217;s heart shall melt&#8230;.

This fact also proves that it is the very crisis we are here tracing in the Bible. It does not destroy true Christians nor spiritual churches; but, saith the Lord, <span class="scripture">&#8220;I will cause the arrogancy of the pr1oud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+13%3A11" title="Isaiah 13:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 13:11)</span></a></span></p>

<h3>Separation of the Wheat and Chaff</h3>
<p>The great war for the extermination of sin out of the heart, or sinners out of the church is destined to sweep over all the nations of the earth. <span class="scripture">&#8220;The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, drew near, and came.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+41%3A5" title="Isaiah 41:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 41:5)</span></a></span> Thus saith the Lord: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith the Lord, and thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+41%3A14" title="Isaiah 41:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 41:14)</span></a></span> When sin and self are all destroyed there is barely enough left of Jacob to constitute a small worm. But by thus reducing her to &#8220;naught,&#8221; God has prepared the church to exhibit His power in shaking the heavens and the earth and bringing <span class="scripture">&#8220;to nought the things that are&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+1%3A28" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 1:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 1:28)</span></a></span>&#8212;the great things of the world.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing-instrument having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaff. Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the Lord, and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+41%3A15-16" title="Isaiah 41:15-16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 41:15-16)</span></a></span> The characteristic of God&#8217;s church here portrayed is nearly lost sight of at present. People think it is the business of the church to stand like a beggar at the door of the devil&#8217;s kingdom and politely coax his subjects over; saying much about the duty and advantage of belonging to church and little about their sin and the duty of repentance, as though God were dependent, and the devil proprietor of the universe. Satan, having thus stolen the spikes out of the church&#8212;her power of execution&#8212;has distinguished himself in helping to run the empty machinery. But he that sitteth in the heavens will arise and bring to naught Satan&#8217;s devices.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;The time is seen coming, by the prophets foretold,
<br />When Zion in purity the world shall behold;
<br />When Jesus&#8217; pure testimony will gain the day&#8212;
<br />Denomination selfishness vanish away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Already the Lord has begun to make Jacob new again; a sharp instrument, reset with the spikes of its primitive power, the <span class="scripture">&#8220;weapons of his indignation.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+13%3A5%3B+Jeremiah+50%3A25" title="Isaiah 13:5; Jeremiah 50:25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 13:5; Jeremiah 50:25)</span></a></span></p>

<p>A church or ministry that is destitute of these teeth will hurt no flesh, awake no persecution, thresh out no wheat, please the devil, and give no glory to God. But spikes are not the only essential to a first-class thresher. Anciently grain was threshed with flails or trodden out by cattle and horses. Then a great improvement was secured by the invention of what is called the &#8220;old open machine.&#8221; But, oh, the heaps of chaff that piled up, and filled the entire floor! Then came the dreadful task of cleaning up&#8212;of separating and removing the worthless heap.</p>

<p>Such have been the crafty open machines that have for years imposed heaps of trash upon the Lord&#8217;s threshing floor. They have not taken <span class="scripture">&#8220;forth the precious from the vile.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+15%3A19" title="Jeremiah 15:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jeremiah 15:19)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;Her priests nave violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they showed difference between the unclean and the clean.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+22%3A26" title="Ezekiel 22:26"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ezekiel 22:26)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;Ye have wearied the Lord with your words&#8230;&#8203;when ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and he delighteth in them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Malachi+2%3A17" title="Malachi 2:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Malachi 2:17)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Is not this perfectly fulfilled at present by preachers who invite sinners into their folds without requiring a particle of saving grace, and who even flatter them that they are already pretty good and need but to come and join the church? And how many of their poor, deluded victims remain in the church for years and never hear the gospel preached straight enough to convict them of their unregenerated hearts! The policy of these teachers has been to &#8220;gather of all kinds,&#8221; but the next thing in order&#8212;to separate and <span class="scripture">&#8220;cast the bad away&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+13%3A48" title="Matthew 13:48"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 13:48)</span></a></span>&#8212;has been wholly omitted. But as the Lord liveth, He is going to clear away this ecclesiastical rubbish.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+3%3A12" title="Matthew 3:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 3:12)</span></a></span> Who would accept as a gift a few bushels of wheat scattered through a great heap of chaff and dirt? And think you that God will accept the church in her present condition? No, indeed; the gold must first be separated from the dross.  The bride must dissolve her unholy friendship with the world, in which she is guilty ofspiritual adultery in the sight of God (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+4%3A4">James 4:4</a>). She must put away all her rival gods, and adorn herself in robes of spotless white, before prepared as a bride for her husband. The Bible most assuredly teaches that God will separate the chaff from the wheat before He comes to garner home His church. To accomplish this He is converting Jacob from an open machine to a separator&#8230;.</p>

<p>Threshing and separating, purging and consuming is the order of God, in the day of the Refiner.

The second class&#8212;all <span class="scripture">&#8220;things that are made&#8221;</span>&#8212;denotes every thing that is not original: every phase of our moral being that is not implanted by the hand of God. Or, in other words, everything adhering to us that was produced by Satan, sin, or the perversion of our moral being. As the Lord says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+15%3A13" title="Matthew 15:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 15:13)</span></a></span> This includes inbred sin. We have all along assumed the existence of this besetting foe. Yet we are aware that a very few deny the fact. But we think David settles this matter in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+51">Psalm 51</a>, where he declares that, as fallen creatures, our very being is <span class="scripture">&#8220;conceived&#8221;</span> and <span class="scripture">&#8220;shapen&#8221;</span> in the mold of sin and iniquity. Paul also avers that we are <span class="scripture">&#8220;by nature the children of wrath&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+2%3A3" title="Ephesians 2:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 2:3)</span></a></span>; and that we are <span class="scripture">&#8220;cut out of the olive tree [Adamic root] which is wild by nature.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+11%3A24" title="Romans 11:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 11:24)</span></a></span></p>

<p>But why multiply texts? Observation must necessarily teach everybody that children are possessed with a perverse nature long before the knowledge of right and wrong is developed. Justified Christians almost uniformly confess this same inward trouble. The remaining question is, can we get rid of it in this life? To decide this, we have but to ascertain whether it is original, or the result of the fall. That it formed no part of the likeness of God in the soul is very certain. It is therefore the <span class="scripture">&#8220;works of the devil,&#8221;</span> and just what Christ <span class="scripture">&#8220;came to destroy.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+3%3A8" title="I&nbsp;John 3:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 3:8)</span></a></span> It shakes, flashes out and roils up when pierced by the sword of the Lord, and must, therefore, be removed from the soul.</p>

<p>But the words of Paul apply to the church, as well as to the individual. It is designed to assay and remove the dross of the whole body of Christ. Before the great holiness reform had shed its benign influence upon the Christian world, and to some extent raised the church out of the narrow rut of churchism into a deeper and broader loyalty to God and unselfish love for humanity, the idea of getting saved from &#8220;your church&#8221; would have been regarded as blasphemy. But, thanks to the Lord! a purer light and higher standard of truth now compel the trumpeters of God all along the line of holiness to insist on salvation from all &#8220;our churches.&#8221; But it may be asked, &#8220;What is it that we must be saved from in &#8216;our churches&#8217;?&#8221; Surely there must be some way to discriminate between that which is pernicious and that which is of God. Now, I know of no corner from which to run off this line but the one that Paul points out: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+3%3A11" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 3:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 3:11)</span></a></span> and, <span class="scripture">&#8220;This word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A27" title="Hebrews 12:27"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 12:27)</span></a></span> God has founded one body&#8212;one church, fold, or kingdom. In it he has placed every element that is essential to its work, its prosperity, and its perpetuity. His wisdom has adapted it to all ages of time and conditions of men. Its faith was delivered to the saints once for all. Its principles and precepts are the last testament, the final and immutable will of the eternal God. This divine organization is invested with such absolute symmetry and perfection that to attempt the slightest modification of its divine unity or polity is wicked presumption in the sight of its divine Founder, and incurs the curses and forfeits all the blessings of God&#8217;s Holy Book. Now, since the work of entire sanctification is designed to elevate the church to her normal and perfect condition in the sight of God, it must shake out and purge away every existing element that was not originally implanted by the hand of the Lord. This test, I think, is one in which all true Christians agree. Indeed, if we were to untie from this moorage we should soon he driven to sea without compass or chart we should virtually open the door for every tradition of Rome and invention of error.</p>

<p>Starting, then, from this corner-stone of divine truth, established at Jerusalem nearly nineteen hundred years ago, and with the Bible as our compass and field notes, let us run off a line.</p>

<p>1. Between the true and false spirits in the church&#8212;let us <span class="scripture">&#8220;try the spirits whether they are of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+4%3A1" title="I&nbsp;John 4:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 4:1)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A9" title="Romans 8:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 8:9)</span></a></span> But the party spirit, so prevalent in the churches, is not of Christ, hence must be removed, purged out of the heart. A zeal that springs from anything but pure, unmixed love for God and humanity, a spirit that would even promote holiness, or the conversion of sinners, partly to build up &#8220;our church,&#8221; is badly mixed, is soon shaken and cannot survive the Refiner&#8217;s fire. It is only when the <span class="scripture">&#8220;eye is single&#8221;</span> that the <span class="scripture">&#8220;whole body is full of light&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+11%3A34" title="Luke 11:34"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 11:34)</span></a></span>&#8212;wholly sanctified.</p>

<p>A spirit which, out of deference to its own creed, willfully disobeys the divine word, is not of God, and can not coexist with a pure heart. All these secondary motives, these mixed and unclean spirits, <span class="scripture">&#8220;shake&#8221;</span> at the voice of the <span class="scripture">&#8220;mighty God,&#8221;</span> and are <span class="scripture">&#8220;removed&#8221;</span> in the thorough work of entire sanctification.</p>

<p>2. The next thing I am compelled in the fear of God to speak of, as included in the catalog of the devil&#8217;s shaky works, the foul grime and chaff of error, is the evil of sectarianism. This is the most destructive bane that God has ever suffered the devil to sow in His kingdom. It is the very mildew of hell, that spreads its blasting curse over nearly all the precious fruit of the Lord&#8217;s vineyard. Here the words of Paul are an all-sweeping besom (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+14%3A23">Isaiah 14:23</a>).</p>

<p>Oft the enlightened Christian&#8217;s conscience inquires whether it is right for the church to be divided thus into a plurality of sects or denominations, with their respective human creeds and party names. In the light of truth we are compelled to answer, No. And for the simple reason that these parties are not of divine origin. Christ is the source of all true union among His disciples, and all divisions between them and the world; while the devil is the instigation of divisions in the church, and of all union between it and the world.</p>

<p>I quote the following from an editorial in the <i>Christian Harvester</i>.</p>

<ol>
<li>&#8220;God has a church on earth. It is one and indivisible. It is made up of all and singular who are born of the Spirit.</li>

<li>&#8220;Individual (local) churches, or congregations, are as Scriptural as they are necessary.</li>

<li>&#8220;There is not one word in the Bible favorable to denominations or sects. The only sect among Christians that is spoken of in terms&#8212;the Nicolaitan&#8212;is severely condemned. There are indications of sectish belief, against which John is supposed to labor in the first chapter of his Gospel, and Paul withstood in the Judaizing tendencies, even in a brother apostle. Denominations are directly or indirectly the result of sin remaining in the great body of professors. Thorough and widespread holiness would soon destroy denominations.</li>

<li>&#8220;But the evangelical denominations of today contain the mass of true Christians, with a multitude of mere professors. Because of differences sects cannot yet be abolished; and an effort at abolition would result in a new one. Therefore sects are a present necessity, until holiness more generally prevails.</li>

<li>&#8220;The possessor of perfect love of necessity overleaps denominations in spirit, and so regards all the sanctified as perfectly his brethren.&#8221;</li>

</ol>
<p>We are personally acquainted with the editor of the <i>Harvester</i>, and believe him a holy man of God. We admire the frankness with which he acknowledges that &#8220;there is not one word in the Bible favorable to denominations or sects,&#8221; and that &#8220;denominations are directly or indirectly the result of sin remaining in the great body of professors.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such must be the honest verdict of every intelligent, God-fearing man. It is no pleasant thing, we know, to look upon and admit this monster evil, this fell destroyer of the purity, love, and power of the Lord&#8217;s Zion. Says William Starr, &#8220;My heart has groaned as, pen in hand, I have looked at this subject, arranged my thoughts to present them to you.&#8221; But for the love of truth I am constrained to differ with the position that sects are a present necessity. They originated from sin in the church; and shall we admit that the fruit of sin is a necessity under any circumstances? &#8220;Shall we do evil that good may come? God forbid.&#8221; Where the cause&#8212;sin in the church&#8212;is removed by full salvation, should not its effects also disappear? But it is thought that &#8220;because of differences sects cannot yet be abolished.&#8221; We might say, with equal propriety, because of sects differences cannot be removed. They coexist and mutually support each other. These divergent views, and party shibboleths, may have had their root in carnality, but they are stereotyped and perpetuated by sectarian parties and their man-made creeds. Therefore we have no more right to palliate the sin of sects because of differences, than to excuse the latter because of the former. One of the great evils of sectarian divisions is, they prevent the return of the church to the <span class="scripture">&#8220;faith once delivered to the saints&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jude+1%3A3" title="Jude 1:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jude 1:3)</span></a></span> and shall we let the baneful tree stand until it ceases to bear its legitimate fruit?</p>

<p>Again, it is thought that &#8220;sects are a necessity until holiness more generally prevails.&#8221; &#8220;Thorough and widespread holiness would soon destroy denominations.&#8221; Sects and holiness are antagonistic to each other. This truth is clearly implied in the above remarks. The fire of true holiness burns up all the fences that Satan has placed between the saints. And shall we defeat this its real mission, by not lifting up the sword of the Lord against sects, and attempt to abolish the evil, until holiness prevails more extensively? That is the same as saying that we should make no attack on unholiness until holiness gains a certain degree of ascendancy. Yea, it provides that we should give place to the devil in the church to destroy holiness, until the church becomes more holy. These are no trifling words. It is a solemn fact that adherence in different denominations is the devil&#8217;s wedge, whereby the unity of the Spirit, so perfectly procured in the grace of prefect love, is again destroyed. Party names, party creeds, and party spirits almost of necessity go together; and the natural return of this spirit, because of membership in a fragmentary church, takes more souls off of God&#8217;s altar than do everything else together.</p>

<p>Let sects alone until holiness prevails! What a device of the enemy! How can we expect to bring forth permanent fruits into holiness, if we allow the plowshare of God&#8217;s truth to slip over this fallow ground of sin? Sects are the devil&#8217;s &#8220;high places&#8221; in the land, the groves of his own planting, and gods that he has set up to corrupt Israel, and &#8220;provoke God.&#8221; How many of the kings Jehovah complains of because they did not, like Josiah, <span class="scripture">&#8220;purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Chronicles+34%3A3" title="II&nbsp;Chronicles 34:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Chronicles 34:3)</span></a></span>! Beware that we partake not of their sins. Of Azariah it is said that <span class="scripture">&#8220;he did that which was right in the sight of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>&#8230;&#8203;save that the high places were not removed&#8230;. And the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> smote the king [Azariah] so that he was a leper unto the day of his death.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Kings+15%3A3-5" title="II&nbsp;Kings 15:3-5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Kings 15:3-5)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Says W. H. Starr (a conscientious Presbyterian minister) after quoting <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+1%3A10-13">I&nbsp;Corinthians 1:10-13</a> in his <i>Discourses on Sectarianism</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">It would seem as if no man could read these words of the great apostle without vividly seeing that party divisions among the people of Christ were, in his view, a most astounding evil. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Is Christ divided,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+1%3A13" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 1:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 1:13)</span></a></span> he says, that ye who are all His, and who have been baptized <span class="scripture">&#8220;by one Spirit&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+12%3A13" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 12:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 12:13)</span></a></span> should be sundered one from the other by party names?</p>

<p>And he adjures them in the most solemn manner, he beseeches them by an appeal the most sacred that words could utter, even by the name of Christ, as it were for His sake, and for His bleeding cause, to forsake these pernicious ways, and to be perfectly joined together in the same mind.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Hear what this author thinks of promoting holiness over these &#8220;high places,&#8221; or sect walls.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">The divisions of the Christian church, as they now exist, are a prominent cause of the low state of piety among believers; the greatest single obstacle which now exists to the spread and triumph of our religion in the world.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>The moment you separate the church of Christ into distinct divisions, you set up the idol of party. Success or adversity will no longer affect the mind simply as they touch the cause of Christ, but they will be felt, also, as affecting &#8220;our side,&#8221; or &#8220;our church.&#8221; It is not Christ and His cause to which their whole thoughts and desires are now turned; the idol of party has now been set up, and it claims, and receives, part of their regard. The man, I think, is almost more than human that can wholly avoid this influence, at least after he has been long identified with any branch of the church. It is an influence which is all the time at work. The idol has been set up to divide the heart from the blessed Savior and His holy service; and its influence is as ceaseless as the existence of the cause. And this party feeling is, as we have seen, the essence of all sin, so that sinful desire is blended continually in the heart with its love to Christ, and pollutes the worship which it offers Him.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>This is an honest and faithful description of this monster evil. The party feeling is very sin. Yea, says this God-fearing man,</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">It casts a millstone round the neck of those who are struggling upwards to the image of their Redeemer. It mingles poison with the streams of salvation that flow to the soul through the church, and casts a blight upon its budding fruit.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Again:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Sectarianism is the greatest foe to the exhibition of love which God has ever suffered Satan to beget. It hinders brotherly love among Christians, and regard for the souls of men. It is vain for brethren in Christ to talk about the duty of loving one another, and to try to feel love for one another, while they refuse to act as love dictates [by separating into parties]. Their actions will control their hearts, as men&#8217;s acts always do in the end. The fences which they set up between them in fact will become fences in <i>feeling</i>. And that is now even so, every Christian knows&#8230;. The divisions of Christ&#8217;s people beget and stimulate continually that opposite spirit of rivalry and contention, which is the spirit of the world&#8230;. Yes, I charge all this mischief, the existence of which you all know, upon the sectarian divisions of the people of Christ; and let him deny it who can. It is in fact their legitimate fruit.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The division of the church into parties not only destroys the power and holiness thereof, but is the greatest impediment to the conversion of the world to God. Again we will hear Brother Starr, and the blessed Redeemer Himself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Would that the church of Christ might pause long enough from its sectarian strife to hear the voice of its Redeemer and Lord pleading with God in prayer on that sorrowful night ere the traitor came&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, <i>that they may be one</i>, as we are&#8230;. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+17%3A11-21" title="John 17:11-21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 17:11-21)</span></a></span> The prayers of Christ were not offered for a light matter, least of all that memorable petition which the pen of inspiration has recorded for the church in all ages to wonder and weep over, the prayer of its dying Lord. The desirableness of that visible union of His people for which Christ prayed as the means of impressing His truth on the world, and the evils of those divisions against which the apostle so earnestly exhorts, need to be better understood by the church&#8230;. May God grant you a disposition to look the evil fairly in the face.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Oh, the thousands of souls that are being lost to all eternity through the selfish, wicked, and carnal spirit of our churchism! God is dishonored, yea, robbed of the purchase of His Son&#8217;s death, and infidelity stalks abroad&#8212;the result of a divided house.</p>

<p>It is said that &#8220;the possessor of perfect love of necessity overleaps denominations in spirit.&#8221; Does not this love prove that they are in the way of the Spirit of Christ? And shall we compel the Lord to drag His children together over these cursed walls, only to have walls rise up again, and grieve away the Holy Spirit?</p>

<p>If it be true that &#8220;thorough holiness destroys denominations,&#8221; then it follows that where they yet exist this genuine degree of holiness has not been attained by the people. But I have not quoted correctly: it is &#8220;thorough and widespread holiness.&#8221; Ah! here is the sticking point&#8212;a condition put in by the enemy of souls. It implies the following: &#8220;Though entire sanctification removes all sectarianism out of my heart, I will still adhere to my sect until people generally abandon their schismatic parties and creeds.&#8221; The devil is perfectly easy over these principles. Now, if this evil is to be done away by popular sentiment, then it is not through holiness; but if by the latter it does not depend upon any foreign influence. The condition of the church in one state does not rob the Word and Spirit of God of their virtue in another. The power of holiness to destroy denominations in one community does not depend in the least upon another. Judah can burn down his groves and destroy his idols, whether Samaria and Ephraim do it or not. Therefore, we repeat, where the professed followers of Christ are divided into a plurality of sects, they have not yet become thoroughly sanctified to God.</p>

<p>Can it be said of professors of holiness that they have &#8220;one heart&#8221; and &#8220;one mind,&#8221; while some have a mind to be Presbyterian, others Baptists, others United Brethren, and others have a mind to adhere to the several different sects of Methodism? Have they <span class="scripture">&#8220;one heart, and one way&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+32%3A39" title="Jeremiah 32:39"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jeremiah 32:39)</span></a></span> when they rise from the solemn altar in the holiness meeting and go, each one in his own way, to the synagogue of his own sect?</p>

<p>Now, I must confess that I cannot see the necessity of this, unless it be to please the devil, break the unity of the Spirit and grieve away the heavenly Dove, bring to naught the divided house of the Lord, and destroy the work of holiness as fast as it can be built up; to this end alone it is necessary.</p>

<p>But let us come still closer home. I would lay the responsibility of this enormous evil just where God places it and all other sin. We shall not be judged by sects, States, nor even by neighborhoods and towns, but <span class="scripture">&#8220;every one of us shall give account of himself to God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+14%3A12" title="Romans 14:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 14:12)</span></a></span></p>

<p>A revival of holiness in a community is the result of personal consecration and faith; and its relapse will be in proportion to the number of individuals that remove the sacrifice from the sanctifying altar. There is no such thing as thorough holiness, except as wrought by the Sanctifier in individual hearts; and if, as has been said, and as I verily believe, thorough and widespread holiness destroys denominations&#8212;burns up sectarian distinctions&#8212;it must do it in your heart as an individual. And if this work is done, the fruits must exhibit the fact; you will be saved by <span class="scripture">&#8220;the precious blood of Christ&#8221;</span> from all <span class="scripture">&#8220;vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+1%3A18-19" title="I&nbsp;Peter 1:18-19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 1:18-19)</span></a></span>&#8212;such as &#8220;Your church,&#8221; &#8220;Our church&#8221;; &#8220;Our preacher opened the doors of the church&#8221;; &#8220;What branch of the church do you belong to?&#8221;; &#8220;You ought to join some branch&#8221;&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+1%3A10" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 1:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 1:10)</span></a></span>&#8212;that grew out of a <span class="scripture">&#8220;[perversion] of the right ways of the Lord&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+13%3A10" title="Acts 13:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 13:10)</span></a></span> and the <span class="scripture">&#8220;gospel of Christ.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+1%3A7" title="Galatians 1:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 1:7)</span></a></span> If the bitter root of sectism is entirely destroyed out of your heart, you will ignore all sectional lines and party fences, the dreadful curse of which Brother Starr has so honestly pointed out. If you are a true, intelligent Bible Christian, a holy, God-fearing man, you must cast off every human yoke, withdraw fellowship from and renounce every schismatic and humanly constituted party in the professed body of Christ. Instead of belonging to some branch you will simply belong to Christ and be a branch yourself in Him, the true vine. Instead of remaining identified with any sect, i.e., cut-off party, &#8220;directly or indirectly the result of sin,&#8221; you will claim membership in and fellowship with the &#8220;one and indivisible church that God has on earth, and that is made up of all and singular who are born of the Spirit.&#8221; On this broad and divinely established platform, and here only, can you stand clear of the sin of sectarianism and the blood of immortal souls that perish through its pernicious influence. Are you strictly loyal to God while you persist in adhering to a sect, notwithstanding He says <span class="scripture">&#8220;there should be no schism [sects] in the body&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+12%3A25" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 12:25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 12:25)</span></a></span>?</p>

<p>I am not advocating the no-church theory that we hear of in the West, but the one, holy church of the Bible, not bound together by rigid articles of faith, but perfectly united in love under the primitive glory of the Sanctifier, <span class="scripture">&#8220;[continuing] stedfastly in the apostles&#8217; doctrine and fellowship,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+2%3A42" title="Acts 2:42"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 2:42)</span></a></span> and taking captive the world for Jesus.</p>

<p>But it is thought that we should not fight against sects nor attempt to abolish the evil at present, lest we thereby form another sect. This is virtually saying we should go on sinning, <span class="scripture">&#8220;lest a worse thing come unto [us]&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+5%3A14" title="John 5:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 5:14)</span></a></span>!</p>

<p>An attempt to rally Israel under any of the many party names and creeds might indeed result in a new sect. But this is not what we contend for. Nay, but let us rather burn to ashes these high places of Israel&#8217;s corruption and, returning to Jerusalem, let us build <span class="scripture">&#8220;upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+2%3A20" title="Ephesians 2:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 2:20)</span></a></span> Let us abandon the nonsense of ecclesiastical succession; cease to inflate our pride and vanity by parading the good and long-since departed, who innocently wore our party badges&#8212;the piety of our fathers will not atone for the worldliness of the church at present. Let us also quit flourishing our church creeds as though their excellency were an essential supplement to the wisdom of inspiration. Let us, we pray you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the sake of our holy and divine religion and a world that is lost in sin&#8212;oh, let us put away these childish things, and return to Jerusalem, not to form a new sect, but as the <span class="scripture">&#8220;servants of the God of heaven and earth, let us build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel [Jesus Christ] builded and set up.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezra+5%3A11" title="Ezra 5:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ezra 5:11)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Many say we need more union of hearts, but think a visible organic union unnecessary; but remember that it was a visible union that Jesus prayed for, such as the world could see and be thereby convinced and saved. We quote once more from W. H. Starr.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">They will say to me: Cannot we have union of feeling without external union [that is, with external disunion]? I answer No, you cannot, except in rare instances, and in an imperfect degree. It is vain to be beating off the leaves of the tree while you continually nourish its roots. And sectarianism is the <span class="scripture">&#8220;root of bitterness,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A15" title="Hebrews 12:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 12:15)</span></a></span> whose acrid and legitimate fruit of divided hearts, and jealousy, and strife, doth continually grieve away the Spirit of our God and Savior, and leave our churches in a comparative poverty of grace and growth that methinks must make the very heavens groan with sorrow as they look down upon our dying world. Up, up! my brother, my sister in Christ, inquire of the Lord concerning this thing! Why slumber ye here while Satan has entered the fold of Christ, a wolf in sheep&#8217;s clothing, and is rending the flock? Oh, cry to God that He will direct you and all the children of His grace, till the church of His holy Son shall be purified and saved. Alas! it is now <span class="scripture">&#8220;a house divided against itself.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+3%3A25" title="Matthew 3:25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 3:25)</span></a></span> Oh, pray that the Lord would unite and build it up in the truth; and that He would show you your duty in the matter. The wants of the world require a holy and united Church.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>From what has been said, and the uniform teaching of the Bible, the following facts are very evident:</p>

<ol>
<li>The division of the church into sects is one of Satan&#8217;s most effectual, if not the very greatest, means of destroying human souls.</li>

<li>Its enormous sin must be answered for by individual adherents to, and supporters of, sects.</li>

<li>The only remedy for this dreadful plague is thorough sanctification, and this is wrought only by a personal, individual contact with the blood of Christ through faith.</li>

<li>The union required by the Word of God is both a spiritual and visible union.</li>

<li>The divisions of the church are caused by elements that are foreign to it as a divinely constituted body, by deposits of the enemy, which exist in the hearts and practices of individual members, involving their responsibility and requiring their personal purgation.</li>

</ol>
<p>These facts make your duty plain. What you and I want, dear reader, is &#8220;thorough and widespread holiness&#8221; in our individual souls to destroy denominationalism there. Holiness, ever so thorough and widespread, around you, will not cleanse your heart; neither can the sin of division in the hearts and lives of others attach to you, unless you drink in their spirit and also become a partisan. You need not waste time in planning general union movements, or praying the Lord to restore the unity of His church, until you go down under the blood and have every bone of contention and cause of division purged out of your own heart; then you may do something to influence others to do the same.</p>


<p>You are praying and longing for the happy time when God&#8217;s children shall all be one, but are you willing that the <span class="scripture">&#8220;once more&#8221;</span> shaking shall have its designed effect <i>in your own case?</i> Do you, indeed, suffer the Holy Ghost fire to consume out of your own life, heart, religion, and conversation, all the shaky chaff and stubble the devil has made to divide the children of God? Do you, indeed, withdraw from and ignore all churches, so called, but the one Christ <span class="scripture">&#8220;purchased with his own blood&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+20%3A28" title="Acts 20:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 20:28)</span></a></span> and founded nearly nineteen hundred years ago, and to which the <span class="scripture">&#8220;Lord added&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+2%3A47" title="Acts 2:47"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 2:47)</span></a></span> you by regeneration? Do you discard every church title but that <span class="scripture">&#8220;which the mouth of the Lord hath named,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+62%3A2" title="Isaiah 62:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 62:2)</span></a></span> even the name of the Father, in which Christ and the apostles kept the church (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+17%3A6%2C11-12%3B+Acts+20%3A28%3B+1+Corinthians+1%3A2%3B+1+Timothy+3%3A15">John 17:6,11-12; Acts 20:28; I&nbsp;Corinthians 1:2; I&nbsp;Timothy 3:15</a>)? Do you honor the divine head of the church by rejecting every creed but the one that <span class="scripture">&#8220;is given by inspiration of God&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+3%3A16" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 3:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 3:16)</span></a></span>; every door that is opened and shut by men; and every spirit but the Sanctifier; and every motive but the love of God and humanity? If you, by the grace of God, die to all these prime causes of sectism and their concomitant sins, then, and not until then, will the Lord have &#8220;thoroughly purged&#8221; so much of &#8220;his threshing floor&#8221; as you will have to answer for in the day of judgment. Where this is not accomplished, the grace of God is frustrated; holiness is not permitted to reach the Bible standard of thoroughness, nor spread its healing virtue to every part of the soul.</p>

<p>It may look foolish to many thus to blow the trumpet of the Lord around the high and massy walls of sectarian glory and selfishness, but the power of God with the faith and shouts of the &#8220;holy people&#8221; will surely bring them down. Though the heaps of sectarian chaff have reached the magnitude of mountains, God has some wheat scattered through them, and He will have it separated for His garner. Therefore He says to Jacob, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Fear not&#8230;&#8203;thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and thou shalt make the hills as chaff. Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+41%3A14-16" title="Isaiah 41:14-16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 41:14-16)</span></a></span></p>

<p>The pure elements of God&#8217;s church possess a wonderful inherent attraction and cohesion; but the devil neutralizes the divine cement by mixing in his chaffy and miry trash, thereby effecting divisions; therefore, the Lord restores union by the <span class="scripture">&#8220;removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A27" title="Hebrews 12:27"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 12:27)</span></a></span> by the enemy, thus removing discord and schism. Glory to God! Little Jacob has barely commenced threshing and separating. Soon we shall see clouds of chaff driven by the <span class="scripture">&#8220;rushing mighty wind&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+2%3A2" title="Acts 2:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 2:2)</span></a></span> from heaven.</p>

<p>Says Brother I. Reed, in his paper, <i>The Highway</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">The great holiness movement is shaking harder than ever. It is to be a real moral earthquake yet. We have nothing to fear in that direction. We have allied ourselves to the Power that does the shaking, and feel a kind of holy joy at the falling walls, reeling Babels and ecclesiastical fortifications that cannot stand the grand holiness shock. In anticipation we enjoy the grand smash-up of things semi-religious&#8212;this half and half, linsey-woolsey type of &#8220;Good God, Dear Mammon,&#8221; kind of fashionable moral froth, too often called &#8220;religion&#8221;&#8212;that is coming some of these days. It is coming. We hear the tread of the mighty army.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Amen. Let the conflict come. God will have a pure church. He will shake the chaffy works of the devil out of His kingdom, though all hell be moved in rage; though Gog and Magog surround the camp of the saints on the breadth of the whole earth.</p>

<p>Dear reader, I am aware that I have here written things that will be unwelcome to many, truths that will assail and stir up many prejudices; but in doing so I have determined to cast from me the fear of man, and clear my conscience in the sight of God.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, my honest conviction that the great holiness reform cannot go forward with the sweeping power and permanent triumph that God designs it should until the gospel be so preached and consecration become so thorough that the blood of Christ may reach and wash away every vestige of denominational distinction, and <span class="scripture">&#8220;perfect in one&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+17%3A23" title="John 17:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 17:23)</span></a></span>&#8212;yea, one <span class="scripture">&#8220;in deed and in truth&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+3%3A18" title="I&nbsp;John 3:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 3:18)</span></a></span>&#8212;all the sanctified.</p>

<p>I am aware that this will elicit storms of persecution, but in the name of the Lord it must come. God will be glorified in the escape of his holy children from all human enclosures into the &#8220;one&#8221; and identical &#8220;fold of Jesus Christ.&#8221; Oh! let us he honest before God in this matter.</p>
