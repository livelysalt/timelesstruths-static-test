<h1>The Gospel Trumpet</h1>

<p>After the Board of Publication of the Northern Indiana Eldership had passed the resolution in November 1880, that they were willing to consolidate the <i>Herald of Gospel Freedom</i> with any other paper that advocated the same gospel principles, a consolidation was effected with a small paper called <i>The Pilgrim</i>, published in Indianapolis, by G. Haines. <i>The Pilgrim</i> was a monthly and had been issued but about eight times. The <i>Herald</i> equipment, it should be remarked, had been donated to Brothers Warner and Haines by the Churches of God in Indiana for the new paper.<a class="notefrom" id="from1" href="#to1">1</a> The decision to effect this consolidation was made in a joint meeting of the Board of Publication and the Standing Committee held in Yellow Lake Bethel, Kosciusko County, Indiana, December 23, 1880. In an old memorandum tablet of Brother Warner&#8217;s is recorded what is apparently a report of this meeting, in his own handwriting. One paragraph, which reads as follows, is of special interest:</p>
<div class="note" id="to1"><p class="notenum noindent first">[1]:</p><p><span class="hidden">[</span>It seems the idea prevailed within the Eldership that &#8220;every member should be under the control of Christ alone in the performance of work appointed him.&#8221; They said, &#8220;We believe that the Lord wishes not His church burthened and perplexed with financial cares. Therefore, Resolved That it is not good that she should own and control a printing office.&#8221; They said further, &#8220;We are willing to assist and support these two brethren in the joint publication of the <i>Gospel Trumpet</i> provided they are permitted to have full control of the same and so long as they keep themselves and the paper wholly in the Lord&#8217;s hands and to His glory.&#8221;</p>

<p>They, of course, did not understand that by means of a corporation, board of trustees, or other legalized body, the church could control its printing business and yet not be &#8220;burthened and perplexed with financial cares.&#8221;<span class="hidden">]</span></p></div>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">On motion it was agreed to consolidate the <i>Herald of Gospel Freedom</i> with the <i>Pilgrim</i>, at Indianapolis, Indiana, and call the new the <i>Gospel Trumpet</i>.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Though he modestly does not say so, it was Brother Warner himself who suggested the name <i>Gospel Trumpet</i>. He felt impressed that the new paper should be called by that name, the idea being associated with such scriptures as the following:</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;The great <i>trumpet</i> shall be blown, and they shall come&#8230;&#8203;and shall worship the Lord in the holy mount.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+27%3A13" title="Isaiah 27:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 27:13)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;The Lord God shall blow the <i>trumpet</i>, and shall go with whirlwinds.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Zechariah+9%3A14" title="Zechariah 9:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Zechariah 9:14)</span></a></span></p>

<p>A scripture containing the word &#8220;trumpet&#8221; always appeared in the heading of the paper. After a few years the heading contained the design of a flying angel blowing a trumpet from which was suspended a scroll containing this inscription, taken from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Zechariah+5%3A2-4">Zechariah 5:2-4</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8220;He said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll&#8230;. Then said he unto me&#8230;&#8203;Every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and everyone that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it. I will bring it forth, saith the Lord of hosts.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>At a later date the design was changed, the angel was reversed, and the following was substituted as an inscription on the scroll: <span class="scripture">&#8220;All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, see ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+18%3A3" title="Isaiah 18:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 18:3)</span></a></span> For many years the heading design contained one or more angels blowing the trumpet.</p>

<p>Brother Warner was a man wonderfully anointed of God for a special work. Since he had received the experience of sanctification in 1877 the Lord had been gradually revealing to him that the true and divinely intended state of the people of God was not that of being scattered in a multiplicity of sectarian divisions but of being perfectly one in Christ, not only in spirit, but in name and invisible aspect. He felt that the teaching of genuine holiness would, in connection with the light of the prophecies bearing on the subject, bring the church out into her pure, undivided state. For such a reformation he was indeed a chosen instrument of the Lord. It was God&#8217;s truth he was preaching. It led, of course, to a crisis in which he received much persecution and was deserted by many. <i>The Trumpet</i>, he realized, was a very effectual instrument God had placed in his hands for accomplishing the great reformation work in this evening time of the Christian era. The time was ripe. True saints of God in various places, in whom was the Spirit of the Lord, were desiring and anticipating a oneness for God&#8217;s people, and when <i>The Trumpet</i> appeared it was just what they were wanting. The fact that it was considered insignificant and ignored in popular religious circles proved its mission none the less divine. God&#8217;s work is frequently accomplished by insignificant instruments. The <i>Trumpet</i> shared Brother Warner&#8217;s difficulties and deprivations. The description of these in the spiritual phase will be reserved for the next chapter. What we shall note here are some of the mere facts of its history.</p>

<p>The oldest copy of <i>The Gospel Trumpet</i> now in the files of the Publishing Office is of the issue of March 1, 1881. The paper began with January 1 of that year, at Rome City, Indiana.<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../texts/Birth_of_a_Reformation/Rome_City_Indiana/index.html">*</a> Two issues were printed there, then the equipment was moved to Indianapolis. The removal occasioned some delay, so that there was no paper printed during the month of February. The new location was over N. 70 North Illinois Street. The paper started as a semimonthly, at a subscription price of seventy-five cents a year. Agents were allowed a commission of fifteen cents on each subscription in clubs of five or upwards. Its object was stated as being, &#8220;The glory of God in the salvation of men from all sin, and the union of all saints upon the Bible.&#8221; It was a four-page, five-column paper of about 13 by 19 inches in size. It at first contained considerable matter on prohibition; but the thing that brought it persecution and isolated it from the fellowship and sympathy of nominal professors was its teaching against sectarian divisions.</p>

<p>Financial privation was one of the handicaps that had to be contended with from the start. On the moving of the equipment to Indianapolis, new type to the amount of $147 had to be purchased. At this time also a new Prouty power press costing $590 was contemplated, the old press being a Washington hand press. It was some years, however, until a power press was installed. In the issue of May 15, 1881, appears the following editorial:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">We are experiencing that it takes a man wonderfully burned out for God to publish a paper that is simply true to Jesus and up to the Bible standard of salvation from all sin. A thousand points of expediency and policy must be disregarded, and the eye fixed on God alone. O reader, you that love God and the truth, do not forget to pray for us. We are here in the city with a family to support, and publishing expenses to meet, and many are withdrawing from us because we will not sanction their idols: but God is always present, and we fear no evil. Thus far, since the paper is all on God&#8217;s altar, He has supplied our needs. Glory to His name!</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Another difficulty that had to be contended with almost from the start was the unfaithfulness of some of those associated with him. He was scarcely settled in Indianapolis when the partnership with Haines had to be dissolved, and the latter then started an opposition paper. The following editorial from the June 1 number will explain:</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>The Opposition Paper</h3>
<p>No person that has the real cause of God at heart can fail to deplore the fact that in this city two papers are now being published, both claiming to be holiness papers, having of course conflicting interests.</p>

<p>That this state of affairs must weaken and wound this sacred cause, and hedge up its way by destroying the confidence of the people in the great truth of holiness, is very apparent to all thinking minds. This being true, fearful responsibilities rest somewhere, and the people have a right to know where.</p>

<p>It is a painful task to refer to the reproach that is brought upon the pure cause of holiness; but it is largely known, and can be remedied only by a statement of the causes and terms of the dissolution of <i>The Trumpet</i> firm. Two papers in the same place with rival interests cannot both be of God&#8212;there is no use trying to smuggle the fact.</p>

<p>The blame must be located, and though its location exposes personal character, it must be done. Paul wrote even with tears of some whom he pronounced enemies of the cross of Christ. Alas, how often the blessed Son of God is sacrificed at the shrine of selfishness, and sold for a few pieces of money!</p>

<p>The office having been donated by the Church of God in northern Indiana, for the use of <i>The Trumpet</i>, we entered into a consolidation and partnership, agreeing that &#8220;each should do one half of the labor, pay one half of the expenses, and receive one half of the income.&#8221;</p>

<p>We went to work in good earnest, published two papers at Rome City, and then shipped the office to this city.</p>

<p>But before it arrived we found our self bound to a chilling iceberg, an austere, worldly, complaining, and mere money policy. Though rather uncongenial to our feelings, we thought it probably all for the better and were willing to go ahead; but ere long the Spirit of God clearly indicated to us that we should not work with this man. We gave the matter all into the hands of God, and told the Lord that if He wished a dissolution, He should bring it about in His own time and His own way.</p>

<p>We had made no note of labors at Rome City, but thought when we set up here we should be under the necessity of doing so; but wishing to avoid every shadow of blame for the separation that we knew was coming, we continued to waive our right in the agreement, and went on working for the Lord, while partner gave His time to the <i>Cincinnati Times-Star</i>, with the exception of an occasional call of a few minutes at the office.</p>

<p>It pleased God to withhold a competent income from the paper. This soon wrought a divine purpose, and partner proposed to dissolve&#8212;offered to give or take one hundred dollars, and the party taking the office pay all the debts on the firm. Having the will of God clearly revealed to us, we could not, without disloyalty to God and infidelity to the brethren who donated the office, abandon it. We also had one hundred and seventy dollars in the office that partner did not, having released notes to that amount against those churches when they kindly donated the office.</p>

<p>We remarked, however, that as the office had been given for the use of <i>The Trumpet</i>, it was not right that, withdrawing from the paper, he should ask that amount of money. But the answer was that <i>The Pilgrim</i> field which had been merged into <i>The Trumpet</i> was worth that to him. We therefore consented to pay the one hundred dollars to satisfy him for the field. But when we remarked that he of course would feel himself under obligations not to start another paper here, both because of the amount received for the field, and for shame&#8217;s sake, as it could only expose the cause to reproach, we were surprised that he would not make a fair promise. We insisted upon it as our right, and he remarked finally that he did not think he would start another. Just then the Spirit said, &#8220;Trust it in the hands of the Lord, God will Himself manage the matter.&#8221; From that time we said no more about it.</p>

<p>We feel that our skirts are clear from the harm that holiness must suffer from this bad example to the world. And if God can bless the little opposition sheet (for such is the spirit of its first issue) we shall be thankful.</p>

<p>Bless the Lord! We have nothing to fear, because we have nothing to lose. The <i>Trumpet</i> is indeed all burned up for God: but out of its ashes shall continue to rise honest, holy, God-fearing pilgrims, instead of &#8220;happy pilgrims&#8221; who rejoice in unrighteous gain. God is now on trial. He is our only resource. On the other hand, a crafty policy slyly gets up a little paper, changes the association meeting from <i>home</i> to Terre Haute, presents it to the congregation, gets <i>four votes</i> in its favor, then himself pronounces it adopted; is elated that he was &#8220;sharp&#8221; enough to get the one hundred dollars and the field also, and now boasts that he will take away <i>The Trumpet</i> subscribers. O Lord, pity and save such a one for Christ&#8217;s sake!</p>

<p>Just now we feel a deeper concern for his salvation than for all we may suffer through his competition. Though doubtless we shall lose some readers through this assumed organ of the State association, a thing that lives only in name, and whose head, professing to be called to labor in the vineyard of the Lord as a gospel minister, prefers the vineyard of the worldly paper as more lucrative, we are thankful that the <i>Gospel Trumpet</i> rests only upon God and its own merits.</p>

<p>Our Father in heaven still owns the universe. Truth has not lost its power; neither have the <i>four votes</i> cast at Terre Haute dethroned the Almighty. Hallelujah! Jesus reigns.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>After dissolution of partnership with Haines, Brother Warner was supplied with a colaborer in J. C. Fisher, who took a half interest, and was very effectual in starting the work in Michigan, where he resided.<a class="notefrom" id="from2" href="#to2">2</a></p>
<div class="note" id="to2"><p class="notenum noindent first">[2]:</p><p><span class="hidden">[</span>See <a href="../../../texts/Birth_of_a_Reformation/The_Crisis/index.html">next chapter</a>.<span class="hidden">]</span></p></div>

<p>Illustrative of the poverty of <i>The Trumpet</i> in its infancy, as well as the construction of the first publishing offices, another editorial from the June 1 number here given. The location of this new office was on Brother Warner&#8217;s lot at 625 West Vermont Street adjoining his residence.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>An Office for the <i>Trumpet</i></h3>
<p>As we have over a mile to walk to our office and have to pay $5 a month for rent, we felt led of the Lord to build an office on our lot. We had a small stable that would afford some material, and, trusting that God would send help, we began to tear it down in the name of the Lord. So the other day a dear old saint who is a carpenter came to inquire what we had to build with. We told him, when he said he had some lumber to add, also door and plenty of windows, which he would give very cheap, and give work also.</p>

<p>We are now looking to God for some means, perhaps thirty dollars, to buy shingles and some other material. Now, dearly beloved reader, as both our family duties and the necessity of curtailing expenses, as well as saving time, require us to build this office, it may be that on account thereof we shall not be able to issue a paper for the 15th of June. Please remember this and do not be disappointed if no paper reaches you. There are two other reasons why it will be somewhat difficult to issue the next number. First, we have a tabernacle in operation and we desire to work all we can in these direct efforts to save souls.</p>

<p>And, second, we think of taking charge of the office and doing most of the work on the paper ourself hereafter; and having but a slight experience in compository work, we shall need to have more time on the first paper. But withal we shall issue a paper if possible. If the Lord has given you a few dollars for the office, send it on. Amen.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>In explanation of why he was not able to issue the paper regularly he writes as follows for August 15 of that same year:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">The announcement that the paper would be on time would have been carried out so far as the work on the paper is concerned, but it did not please the Lord to send us the means to purchase the paper, hence the delay. Well, we are willing that God should stop the <i>Trumpet</i> altogether if He will. It belongs wholly to Him, and so do we, and, bless God, we have nothing to say about it. Oh, how perfectly dead to all self in the matter! We will say to our readers that <i>The Trumpet</i> shall only be issued as the Lord furnishes the means every two weeks if possible, if not, let all know that it was not in our power to do so, and that all our subscribers shall have the worth of the money paid. Owing to the past delays and the fact that we are led to attend some camp meetings, we skip one number with the present issue.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>In the November 1 number we notice more privation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">We did not move, neither were we able to plaster our office. How then do you think we managed to get out this paper? We will tell you. Dear Wife tendered her kitchen to the Lord for the use of publishing salvation. Praise the Lord! By thus crowding in a sufficient amount of the office to get along for the winter we shall save fuel, and the expense of finishing the office until next fall. Thank God, we are willing to get along any way for Christ&#8217;s sake, so that we may fulfill our mission and publish truth and righteousness. We are not at all mortified at these humble facilities from which <i>The Trumpet</i> goes forth to its readers. Christ started His earthly mission from a manger. Oh, no, we are not ashamed to let all men know that the <i>Trumpet</i> is published in the rear of a small cottage. God&#8217;s presence makes the whole domicile sacred. Oh, how wonderfully He pours out his glory on our souls in this work!</p>

</blockquote>


<p>On the other hand, there were others in whom God had planted a love for the truth. Among these was Brother Warner&#8217;s faithful printer. God had preserved a few who should contribute sufficient to the paper to keep it going.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>How It Looks to Others</h3>
<p>We know that many think it big to be an editor, hence before and ever since we entered upon this work we have feared and dreaded being actuated by such motives. When we go out to work in the field and we just tell God to let <i>The Trumpet</i> stop if it is His will and we will keep right on evangelizing, the Spirit&#8217;s voice soon compels us to return to this sacred charge.</p>

<p>Once when we had the office up in the city, God tried us thoroughly. We had no money to pay the printer, and he was out of meal tickets, which must be paid in advance. We were sent for to come to a meeting in Terre Haute. A brother wrote that he would pay our fare, so we borrowed the money and went down on Saturday morning. We told the Lord that if He did not want the paper to continue, to let the printer leave and get work somewhere else. As we walked from the depot to the office on our return, Monday eve, we said, <i>If that young man is in the office, it is the wonderful dealing of God.</i> We entered and found him cheerfully working away. On Saturday he ran the press all day without a bite to eat. As he told us this our heart was melted. We entered our little sanctum and poured out our soul to God, and he sent the Spirit as the dews of heaven upon our heart.</p>

<p>When we started for the Camargo camp meeting, we had a few dimes. Having been provided with a free pass, through the kindness of Brother &#8212;&#8212;, who wrote that for months he had not thought of the camp meeting without seeing us on the program and that we must be there without fail, we left with Wife all our change but two nickels. Told our printer that as we had no money to give him he might quit if he saw fit and hunt a position where he could get his pay. We remarked that as <i>The Trumpet</i> was not ours we had no choice whether it lived or died. Well, it cost us five cents to reach the depot by streetcar, and the other nickel to carry us and baggage from the train to campground, so we just had enough. Praise God from whom all blessings flow! Though we were brought there by the direction of God&#8217;s Spirit through Brother &#8212;&#8212;, the high priest in charge, probably out of self-interest, gave us no place in the pulpit. But God gave us a field to work in, and the hearts of the <span class="scripture">&#8220;people who do know their God,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;q=people who do know their God " title=""><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> ()</span></a></span> and, blessed be His name, in that meeting He gave us over sixty-one dollars. So <i>The Trumpet</i> still sends out the certain sound. Here is a sample of many letters received the last few months. It will show how others see <i>The Trumpet</i> in relation to God&#8217;s will and Satan&#8217;s dread:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah yes, Brother Warner, it is <i>The Trumpet</i> the devil wants stopped. You may evangelize all you please, so <i>The Trumpet</i> goes under, and the devil doesn&#8217;t care. Do stand by <i>The Trumpet</i> at all hazards.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course we know that all such expressions relate to the awful and offensive truth of God that we give place to in <i>The Trumpet</i>, and not to any ability we possess to write or conduct a paper. We are too sorely and constantly pinched by a sense of our own ignorance to think anything else.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>In the November 15 number, under the heading, &#8220;The <i>Trumpet</i> Will Go On,&#8221; we have the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">God has blessed us with excellent health and strength. Praise His holy name! We can work without apparent fatigue from 5 A.M. to 11 P.M., and we propose doing so, by the continued help of God. We feel that the gates of hell cannot stop the truth. And if we cannot issue the paper regularly every two weeks, we will issue as often as we can, and give everybody his or her full number of papers. The Lord holds us to this work, and He cannot forsake us in the work whereunto He has called us. Let all the readers of <i>The Trumpet</i> obey the voice of the Spirit of God, and there will be means both to enlarge and carry on the paper for the glory of God. Oh, if the God of salvation could but reach some who are blessed with means and draw out about two hundred dollars it would pay all <i>The Trumpet</i> debts, get the necessities to enlarge the paper and provide a good little stock of paper to start with. We will work, and pray, and trust, and God and the dear people will provide the means.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>At the beginning of the second year the price of <i>The Trumpet</i> was raised to one dollar.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">For some time before <i>The Trumpet</i> raised to one dollar, nearly everybody sent us one dollar instead of seventy-five cents. Thus the Lord has fixed the price, and He will provide for its enlargement.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The enlargement came with the first issue in February. It was made a six-column, four pages&#8212;15 by 22. In the first issue of the new size we find the following editorial:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">We printed two thousand papers this issue. It is quite a task on our hand press; but, praise God, He gives us blessed health and strength, and we are perfectly satisfied to work on with the means the Lord has furnished, until He sees proper to give us others.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Early in the autumn of 1882 the publishing office was moved to Cardington, Ohio. Here was a congregation of saints among whom the publishing work could be better supported. A very pleasant office, warm and well lighted, was rented for thirty dollars a year. Brother Warner acknowledges his enjoyment of the great kindness, love, and cooperation of the true saints there. It seems, however, that even there the work did not make much progress. The old press had by this time become very unsatisfactory. Brother Warner sought to hire his printing work done elsewhere, but his effort resulted in his having to print the first issue of 1883 on a job press, with the paper reduced in size to a four-column 11 by 15. The price was dropped to seventy-five cents, then to fifty cents. The following editorial will give an insight to his situation:</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>This Little Trumpet</h3>
<p>Having had our last issue printed on our neighbor&#8217;s steam press, we concluded it would pay us to trade our old press on a jobber and have them print the paper regularly.</p>

<p>Our chief reason for so doing was this: in the time that it would take us to print them on the slow old press, we could make more on job-work than would pay the printing. But, behold, when our neighbors learned that we were getting a job-press, they seemed to think we were intruding on their territory, and not having the utmost confidence in their typographical ability they thought to make us pay a sort of royalty for the privilege of doing job-work here, by raising the price of printing <i>The Trumpet</i> from four dollars to eight dollars an issue; and while we conceded the perfect right to charge that price, we were happy for the privilege of saving that amount and printing on our job-press.</p>

<p>Of course, we can print but one page at a time, which makes four impressions for a folio; and if we print as large as <i>The Trumpet</i> has been, it will take eight times running through the press, which, after all, can be done in about the same time it took to print it in two impressions on the old press, and takes one to run instead of three.</p>

<p>When the paper comes to you only half the old size we will call it but a half number, so we will not defraud our subscribers in the least. But we desire to send you eight pages every two weeks if we possibly can. When we cannot, please bear with us until the kind providence of God and the liberality of the saints help us to get a paper-press.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The eight-page proposition did not then materialize. About this time was adopted the motto, which was carried for many years: &#8220;First pure, then valiant for the truth.&#8221; The home of the <i>Gospel Trumpet</i> was not long at Cardington. Brother Warner was desirous of having a permanent home for the <i>Trumpet</i>, where he would not have to pay rent. When he moved to Cardington, he did not feel that that would be the permanent place for the paper. Kind brethren in Michigan made very liberal offers and asked him to come there; but a place was opening at Bucyrus, twenty miles distant, in Crawford County. While he was in prayer pleading earnestly for God&#8217;s direction, three teams drove up. It was the brethren from Bucyrus, who had come to move the office to that place and also help it out of financial difficulties. There was great joy in Brother Warner&#8217;s heart as he realized that God had answered prayer and sent help. One of these brethren, D. D. Johnston, assisted in the matter of finances. He purchased a lot and furnished material with which to erect a building. His name appeared as publisher in August 1883.</p>

<p>Brother Warner proceeded to build a small office on the lot at Bucyrus. In the last number printed at Cardington he writes as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">While you read this paper, the editor will be personally at work erecting a house in which to carry on the work of the Lord. If we were building a house for ourself we should want to count the cost before commencing; but we are building this house unto the Lord, and the earth and the fullness thereof are His, hence, we need not stop to count since He says go forward. The undertaking is wholly by faith. While at work with our hands we shall pray without ceasing to our heavenly Father to send us the means.</p>

<p>We have had experience enough in our business to know that we never can carry on the paper and pay rent. It is claimed that a paper is not self-supporting with most any number of subscribers without receiving advertisements. Just yesterday in the office of a temperance paper we were told by an editor and publisher that we ought to take in one thousand dollars every year for advertisements, and he could not see how the paper could be carried otherwise. But, beloved, it must be carried otherwise or not at all. Neither do we wish to do any secular job-work if we can help it. We shall dispose of our job-press and material as soon as possible. Now, beloved, when we shall have obtained a good paper-press (and it is already bought, thank God) and a place free of rent, with much self-denial and care we shall be able to send you a paper 22 by 32 every two weeks.</p>

<p>Some of our dear brethren have in love censured us occasionally. We find generally these two points, sometimes in the same letter, namely, &#8220;Why do you not send your paper out more frequently and more regularly?&#8221; And the other, &#8220;I think you have not been on your guard enough to keep out of debt.&#8221; Well, there it is. We could have kept entirely out of debt if we had issued fewer papers, and we might have issued every two weeks had we gone more in debt. But no one of our experience could possibly have issued more frequently, with our income and slow facilities. Our dear brethren are without a knowledge of what they are talking about. But now, beloved, as we are in this desperate effort to get entirely out of debt and to get situated so as to cut off much of our past expense, we hope that all will send us the help they can.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The move to Bucyrus was made in May 1883. About that time the first good press was purchased. It was a rebuilt Country Campbell, allowing either belt or hand power to be used, and costing perhaps six hundred dollars.</p>

<p>The trying times through which <i>The Trumpet</i> had to pass in its early years are known only to God. It was perhaps His design that it should be tried as gold is tried. There were always a few consecrated hearts who contributed of their means. Some put everything they had into the work. Thus the work was kept alive. Little did Brother Warner realize, when he was located at Bucyrus and the prospects looked good, that there he should go through the bitterest trial of his life. The light of <i>The Trumpet</i> came very near being snuffed out entirely. Bucyrus was the narrows in <i>The Trumpet&#8217;s</i> voyage, through which it barely passed. This will be described in our next chapter.</p>

<p>The office of <i>The Trumpet</i> remained at Bucyrus nearly a year. Some brethren in Michigan were desirous of having it moved to their locality. Progress had been made at Bucyrus, but it was through the furnace of trial rather than any extension of influence. But doubtless all this experience was necessary as an equipment for greater usefulness.</p>

<p>The move to Williamston, Ingham County, Michigan, was made in April 1884. A Mr. Horton, a businessman of Williamston, in whom the Lord had planted a love for the truth, went to Bucyrus and had the office equipment shipped. The saints in Michigan had in the meantime obtained possession of a two-story building 28 x 84 feet, and they had it partitioned, or remodeled, to suit the need, the upper story to he used for a hall or assembly room, the rear of the lower floor to be used for living rooms and the front for an office. Brother Warner rejoiced with tears when the work got started in its new and enlarged quarters in Williamston. The first number of the paper published there was dated April 15. From its columns we quote the following greetings:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">We are happy to greet your ears once more, beloved, with the sound of the trump of God. The devil has spent all his infernal powers in vain to crush this work of God. We have thoroughly learned his attitude toward us. In his hellish clamor about us for many days, saying, &#8220;You must give up <i>The Trumpet</i>,&#8221; he has clearly committed himself against this cause, and all who are against this dissemination of the light of God we know are on the devil&#8217;s side, either willfully or ignorantly. Oh, how hell has poured forth upon us! Night after night we had to leave our bed at two, three, and four o&#8217;clock, and go to the office and cry unto God to drive away the hosts of hell that had encamped against us. And every time the power of God dispersed these infernal spirits of darkness, the Lord re-commissioned us to blow the <i>Trumpet</i> in Zion, and sound an alarm on His holy mountain, and we were made joyfully conscious of his approving smile for not having backed down before the legions of hell. But the devil having drawn to his side the best agents he could ever expect to use against us, was fierce and determined to hush the <i>Trumpet</i> sound of freedom from all sin and Babylon yokes. Oh, hallelujah!</p>

<p>During this terrible combat with the powers of darkness, we had to do more fighting than working, hence the work went on slowly. We were ready to print about the first of February, then the Lord called us by telegram to Kalamazoo, Michigan. The next day our printer accidentally spoiled the rollers, so that he could not print. So the work lay until our return. After looking to the Lord until He assured us that the office would be cleared from the mortgage, we ordered new rollers, and went to work again in the name of the Lord. About the time we were ready to print, God sent Brother Thomas Horton, from Williamston, Michigan, who paid off the five-hundred-dollar mortgage, some other debts, chartered a car, loaded us up, and moved office, household goods, Master Willie, and ourself to this place, Wife and child having remained behind to visit with friends. Moving just at the time caused a few days delay in this issue, but now we expect to greet you regularly. Praise the Lord! <span class="scripture">&#8220;The L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> gave, and the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> hath taken away; blessed be the name of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Job+1%3A21" title="Job 1:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Job 1:21)</span></a></span>! So said Job. If it was the devil that took it away, but he had to get a permit from God before he could do it, therefore it was of the Lord, and <span class="scripture">&#8220;blessed be the name of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>&#8221;</span>; for when He permits the devil to take anything away He has given to His children, He always returns fourfold. We have understood this principle long ago, and have thrown it in the face of the devil every time he has shown his teeth at us. Blessed be God forever and ever! And thus hath God done unto us again. We left an office where we were hampered up in 14 x 26 feet, and here has God furnished a building two stories high, 28 x 84 feet, all of which is dedicated to the Lord. It contains a large meeting hall, and plenty of room for office and all families connected with it. It is, however, under repairs, and we have taken temporary quarters for a few weeks.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Every change that was made gave occasion for new hopes for the advancement of the publishing work. Accordingly we read in the first issue at Williamston: &#8220;After one more issue we expect steam power, and there is no telling what God will yet do for <i>The Trumpet</i> if the devil doesn&#8217;t quit his hellish opposition.&#8221; An engine was purchased during the first year at Williamston. It was of three horsepower and cost two hundred dollars. Thus, after the trying times of the first four years of its life, the <i>Trumpet</i> work began to make substantial progress and the reformation cause to expand and become permanent.</p>

<p>The next move for <i>The Gospel Trumpet</i> was in the summer of 1886. Near Bangor, in VanBuren County, was a yearly camp meeting. There were many saints in the vicinity and near Grand Junction, seven miles north. At the Bangor camp meeting in June 1866, the subject of moving the <i>Trumpet</i> Office<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../texts/Birth_of_a_Reformation/The_Gospel_Trumpet_Grand_Junction_Michigan/index.html">*</a> to that part of the state was considered. It seemed to be the mind of the Spirit and of all the saints that the removal should be made. A commodious and substantial building in the town of Grand Junction was offered for eight hundred dollars, or about half its worth. The saints agreed to purchase the property, and money was raised to pay moving expenses. An encumbrance of five hundred dollars on the machinery was also paid off. Accordingly it was decided to move. One freight car held the entire outfit of office material, machinery, and household goods.</p>

<p>Grand Junction, &#8220;where two lightning tracks lay crossing,&#8221; was a small town of a few hundred inhabitants, the junction of the Chicago and West Michigan (now the Pere Marquette) and a branch of the Michigan Central Railways, ten miles from South Haven on the lake and thirty miles west of Kalamazoo. This became the permanent home of the <i>Gospel Trumpet</i> during twelve years of its history.</p>

<p>Before the move to Grand Junction, Brother S. Michels, of South Haven, assumed with his means a portion of the financial responsibility. Being thus directly connected with the publishing work, his name appeared as publisher, which position he held till relieved by N. H. Byrum, in 1895.</p>

<p>About a year after the publishing office was located at Grand Junction, the publishing work, and the church as well, suffered the defection of J. C. Fisher, who had been on the editorial staff and had been useful in the ministry.<a class="notefrom" id="from3" href="#to3">3</a> He was succeeded as assistant editor by E. E. Byrum, who remained on the staff for many years, and after Brother Warner&#8217;s death became editor.</p>
<div class="note" id="to3"><p class="notenum noindent first">[3]:</p><p><span class="hidden">[</span>See <a href="../../../texts/Birth_of_a_Reformation/The_Crisis/index.html">The Crisis</a> for further mention of this.<span class="hidden">]</span></p></div>

<p><i>The Gospel Trumpet</i> was a mighty factor in the reformation work, a very effectual means of spreading the truth. At Grand Junction the Office grew to a substantial printing plant, sending out tons of literature. Books were printed, a children&#8217;s paper was started, and <i>The Trumpet</i> became a weekly. It was here that Brother Warner&#8217;s death occurred in 1895. We close this chapter with the publishing work located at Grand Junction. Brief reference to its present status will be made in another chapter.</p>
