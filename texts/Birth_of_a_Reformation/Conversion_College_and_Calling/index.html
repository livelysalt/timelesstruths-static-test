<h1>Conversion, College, and Calling</h1>

<p>It is natural that the question of religion should present itself to a young man or woman when approaching maturity. It is then that life is full of prospects, when one plans and builds for the future. It is then that opinions are formed, and there is an inclination to reach some kind of decision, for the time being at least, regarding every issue. One reaches this parting of the ways and the question comes, &#8220;Which road shall I take?&#8221; The answer, so far as religion is concerned, depends to some extent on what one has observed in those who make a profession, though it is true that the influence of the Holy Spirit alone&#8212;that monitor who makes his appeal to the inner consciousness&#8212;sometimes decides the question.</p>

<p>The community at New Washington, where the Warner family lived, was strongly Catholic and Lutheran. There was too much whisky and tobacco and too little of genuine Christianity for a convincing testimony in favor of the latter. As for Dan Warner, he thought to decide the question of religion by trying to be an infidel. But of course he had not considered that God might speak to him and convince him against his will. He naturally possessed a tender conscience, a capacity to exalt righteousness and a susceptibility to right spiritual influence.</p>

<p>And so we find him on reaching the age of maturity trying to believe there was nothing in Christianity; but at this his success was poor. There were certain persons within his field of acquaintance whose Christian piety made its impression. Then again, there was the influence of song. He had a good voice and found enjoyment in engaging in song with the young people. On a Sunday afternoon, at a neighbor&#8217;s, where a number were gathered and were singing gospel hymns, he became greatly affected. God spoke to his conscience. His conviction was so strong as to cause him for several months to lose his love for the dance and to reflect seriously on his course of life. It was his turning point so far as infidelity was concerned.<a class="notefrom" id="from1" href="#to1">1</a>
</p>
<div class="note" id="to1"><p class="notenum noindent first">[1]:</p><p><span class="hidden">[</span>The use of tobacco was very common among the professors in his community. It is related that he received an impression of the evil of this habit when on attendance at a prayer meeting he saw one of those present attempt to take a chew secretly, by hiding his face behind a chair.<span class="hidden">]</span></p></div>

<p>But after a few months, when the conviction had worn away somewhat, he began to renew his attendance at dances, and apparently to be more reckless than ever regarding his spiritual well being. His heart, however, was yet tender from the wound made by the spirit of conviction. One night during a severe illness of his sister he attended a dance. After he had returned home at two o&#8217;clock in the morning, his mother went to his room and expostulated with her boy regarding his sinful career. Here again is where a mother&#8217;s part played effectively. As she reasoned with him on his wrong conduct, his going to a dance while his sister&#8212;his only sister&#8212;lay at the point of death, and his offence against a just God, before whom he must one day stand in judgment, the depths of his heart were broken up and he fell on his knees and called for mercy.</p>

<p>From that time he was deeply convicted, though to his companions he gave no evidence of a changed life, as he had not received the new birth. With some young friends he began to attend a protracted meeting in a schoolhouse not far from his home. The meeting was one of power, and sinners were made to reflect on the question of their souls&#8217; salvation. On their way home one night his companions were expressing their opinions as to religion, what it was, etc. One of them, addressing Dan, said, &#8220;What do <i>you</i> think it is?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I am going to find out.&#8221; Knowing him to be prankish the others supposed he meant to play some trick, and as they separated, wondered to themselves what Dan could have up his sleeve. Not until he had gone forward to the altar the next evening and they had seen him rise a changed young man with the peace of God in his countenance did they take his words and actions seriously.</p>

<p>The date of this, his conversion, was February 1865. He refers to the event some years later as follows: &#8220;Passed once more the old schoolhouse where I gave my heart to God (February, 1865). Thank God for that step! Oh, how glad I am it was ever my lot to become a Christian!&#8221;</p>

<p>Another item of interest relating to this time was his engagement to Frances Stocking, reference to which in his diary for <a name="11. Visited" href="../../../texts/Birth_of_a_Reformation/A_Nebraska_Mission/?anchor=11. Visited#11.%20Visited">June 11, 1874</a>, the reader will find further on.</p>

<p>One quality that was manifest in Brother Warner&#8217;s early religious life as well as throughout his entire career was earnestness. He was sincere and intense in his devotion and his Christian work. We shall find as we read the notes from his diary that his words breathe a spirit of love and devotion, evincing a deep spirituality. When he yielded to God, he meant it as the decision of his very soul, and his conversion was for him an actual change for time and eternity. Old things were passed away. New propositions and prospects arose to occupy his thoughts.</p>

<p>What ideals and plans were his immediately after his conversion we do not know. It was not long, however, until he decided that a more advanced education was needful. Nothing will give a young person nobler ambitions and greater desire to rise to all that is good and associated with usefulness than Christianity. On the 5th of September of the same year of his conversion he started to school at Oberlin College<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../texts/Birth_of_a_Reformation/D_S_Warner_at_Oberlin/index.html">*</a> and enrolled for an English preparatory course. The details of his study at Oberlin and just how long he remained have not been learned. An old memorandum of his accounts indicates that he attended there only two months at first, and then taught school through the winter at Corunna, Indiana, returning to Oberlin in the spring, and that he started again with the new school year in September, 1866. It is known, however, that his excellency of character shone while he was at school and was the subject of remark.</p>

<p>He did not attend college as long as he had expected to; for it was while he was there that he began to feel God&#8217;s hand upon him for the ministry. When he saw how long it would take to complete his college work and the need of laboring in the Lord&#8217;s harvest while it was day, he felt impressed that God wanted him to cut short his college course and to prepare at once for the ministry. He accordingly went home, arranged for a room in his father&#8217;s house, and spent one season there in applying himself to prayer, Bible study, and those other things which he believed were directly necessary to his ministerial preparation.</p>

<p>Preparation for the ministry is more successful when, along with it, there can be more or less of actual practice. We can believe that Brother Warner was spiritual enough to keep in touch with God and to discern the divine leading in the important matter to which he had committed himself. At any rate, in connection with his work of preparation he began to engage in ministering the gospel. He preached his first sermon on Easter night, 1867, in a Methodist Episcopal protracted meeting in the Cogswell Schoolhouse, not far from where he lived. The text was <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+3%3A18">Acts 3:18</a>&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;But those things, which God before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.&#8221;</span></p>
