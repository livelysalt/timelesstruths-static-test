<h1>A Nebraska Mission</h1>

<p>The denomination known as the Church of God, founded by John Winebrenner in Pennsylvania in 1830, soon spread over western Pennsylvania and Ohio and gradually extended its missionary effort into the States farther west. Brother Warner&#8217;s field of labor in Nebraska covered more or less the counties of Seward, York, Polk, Hamilton, and Fillmore. We shall again let him speak for himself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first"><b>June 25, 1873.</b> This is my birthday. Thirty-one years of my hasty life have passed away. They have gone to eternity. Their record has all been entered upon the book by the Scribe of heaven. O Lord, whatever has not been set down to thy glory, for Jesus&#8217; sake blot out in the blood of Christ! Only eight years have been devoted to God and they crowded with many imperfections. Great God, I thank thee that we have an advocate to plead our cause and secure our pardon. Wash me, Lord, and make me clean. Oh, keep me pure in heart, that the remainder of life may all be given to God!</p>

<p>Took train at Upper Sandusky for Chicago. Ate dinner in Fort Wayne. Stopped off at Warsaw and went to New Paris to visit my brother-in-law. Found him and family well, thank the Lord. Eve, heard Dr. Everitt lecture on phrenology.</p>

<p><b>26.</b> Was examined by Everitt and received a chart of character and instruction. I heard him deliver a course of lectures in my schoolroom in Corunna, Indiana, the fall of 1865. He lectured in the evening on temperaments. Took notes.</p>

<p><b>28.</b> Put in the day viewing the great city of Chicago. Nearly all the burnt district is built again with enormous buildings. It is wonderful to think that for miles we can walk streets built up on either side with magnificent buildings of brick, stone, and marble, from three to nine stories high, iron fronts, etc., all built since the fire. It inspires the heart with wonder and admiration to behold externally and internally the enormous hotels Sherman, Palmer, Tremont, and Pacific, of which the latter is the largest. It covers one half block and is nine stories high. Passed through under Chicago River. Chicago is one of the wonders of the world, a great city. Visited one of the parks. I was much interested with all we saw.</p>

<p><b>29.</b> Sabbath. I preached in the evening from these words: <span class="scripture">&#8220;What do ye more than others?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+5%3A47" title="Matthew 5:47"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 5:47)</span></a></span> The day was pleasantly spent. Brother Shoemaker has spent nine years in trying to build up a Church of God here. Though the membership is yet small, we have a good church property and some good brethren here. I had the pleasure of seeing the wife, two sons, and one daughter of Elder John Winebrenner, who are members of the church here.</p>

<p><b>30.</b> Took train at 10 A.M. on Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad to Nebraska City. Crossed the Mississippi River.</p>

<p><b>July 1, 1873.</b> In A.M. took train for Danville, distance thirteen miles. Stopped at Bro. R. H. Bolton&#8217;s. Found all well.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> Enjoyed my visit very much with this lovely family. Received many useful hints from Brother B. concerning the West and the great missionary work.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> Daylight found us at Creston. From there to Red Oak the country is a beautiful rolling prairie. Very little is cultivated, all grass. At Red Oak took branch road southwest to Nebraska City through a beautiful prairie valley. Beautiful corn. At Hamburg, eleven miles from Nebraska City, we came to a peculiarly formed bluff, high and sharp, from which we can see the city. Crossed the Missouri River at Nebraska City on the steamer <i>Lizzie Campbell</i>. The river was high and ran swiftly.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> This is a proud day for Americans, the anniversary of American independence. There was quite an interesting celebration in Nebraska City. Free dinner, band, thirty-seven young ladies dressed in white with badges bearing the names of the thirty-seven states, also the goddess of liberty. Judge Kinney delivered a good speech on the occasion. A great crowd of people were in attendance. The whole matter displayed skill and ingenuity in its design and execution. Arrived at Seward at 9:30 P.M. Walked out through the prairie two miles to Bro. William Anderson&#8217;s.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> Visited Brother James Anderson. Walked across the country. How sublime and beautiful the rolling prairie! There is a strong breeze here nearly all the time, which makes the summer pleasant and agreeable. The wind is from the east; a good part of the time it is from the southeast.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> Sabbath. At 4 P.M. I preached my first sermon in Nebraska, in the Anderson Schoolhouse. Text, <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+62%3A6">Isaiah 62:6</a>.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Here we have to pass over a period of eight months. It is unfortunate that we do not have all of the books, forming a continuous diary account. His notes written during his first winter on the Western plain would have been interesting. As it is, we have to pass over the fall and winter of 1873 and begin again in March 1874.<a class="notefrom" id="from1" href="#to1">1</a> By this time it seems that he had taken up a claim at Wayland, Polk County. The <i>Advocate</i> he refers to was the church paper, published at Harrisburg, of which he was a correspondent. This chapter includes a temporary absence from the State, occasioned by his marriage and visit in Ohio, after which he returns with his helpmeet to his Western field. His references to Sarah, his bride-to-be, are, of course, full of tenderness. We shall give but brevities from the diary, omitting many of the details of sermons and texts, number converted, etc. The meetings first mentioned were held near Seward.</p>
<div class="note" id="to1"><p class="notenum noindent first">[1]:</p><p><span class="hidden">[</span>Dr. Forney, in his <i>History of the Churches of God</i>, says of D. S. Warner&#8217;s mission work in Nebraska, that in February 1874, he organized a church at Fairmount, Fillmore County, of twenty-four members. Also one at Cropsey, one at Evergreen, one in the Anderson community, Seward County, of sixteen members, and one other. He had fourteen preaching places.<span class="hidden">]</span></p></div>

<blockquote>
<p class="first"><b>March 14, 1874.</b> This is a rainy day, the first of any account since the 22nd of November. Wrote two articles for the <i>Advocate</i> and some letters.</p>

<p><b>15.</b> Sabbath. Preached at eleven on the second advent of Christ, two hours. Eve, Brother Robotham preached. &#8217;Twas dry and dead enough to take all the life out of a meeting. I tried to exhort the people. Jesse Horton found peace to his soul. Thank God for the salvation of the old gray-headed sinner. Sister Anderson left her husband who sat by her side, and came to the altar in much earnest, seeking the Lord. This is a noble example. God bless the woman. I think her husband will follow.</p>

<p><b>16.</b> The air was damp today. Read Nelson on Infidelity. Prayed and meditated. Eve, had some headache, but thank God it did not grow worse and prevent my preaching, as it sometimes does. The night was dark and damp. The congregation was much smaller than usual. Had good liberty. A number of young people were present, about all of whom were serious.</p>

<p><b>17.</b> Had prayer meeting at schoolhouse. Came home and wrote a letter to my darling Sarah, then went to Seward. Received a letter from Brother Shuler, treasurer, with post office order for fifty dollars.</p>

<p><b>19.</b> Day meeting at half past ten. P.M., mounted a horse and rode in company with Brother Figard to Mr. Pense&#8217;s, two miles. Talked to them on the important subject of their souls&#8217; salvation. Returned with some headache. Was disappointed in not having some one else there to preach, as Brother Combs, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, had promised to be there for the last two nights. Thank God, my headache abated and I spake with liberty on the text, <span class="scripture">&#8220;My spirit shall not always strive with man.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+6%3A3" title="Genesis 6:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 6:3)</span></a></span></p>

<p><b>21.</b> Started for Fillmore County. Stopped a few minutes at a store at Nickleville. Heard some poor sinners swearing horrible oaths. Oh, how my heart was pained to hear them thus insult the Author and Giver of all their blessings! Came to Brother Witter&#8217;s. Found all well and faithful to their Savior. They were much joyed at my coming. The church has grown in grace and influence.</p>

<p><b>22.</b> Sabbath. Beautiful morn; Met at 10:30 A.M., heard a number of the brethren and sisters speak. Went to Indian Creek, where I had the pleasure of immersing the following [names nine persons]. It was a glorious time. All were happy. We felt that we were near heaven. At 3 P.M. started over to Brother Moffit&#8217;s. Passed a pond of some ten acres on which were all of a thousand brants, a species of wild goose; they are white, except a black streak across their wings. Reached destination. Here are good pr1ospects for gathering a church.</p>

<p><b>23.</b> Quite cold this morn; I have to drive about thirty-five miles against the wind. It was a hard day&#8217;s ride. Came on to the meeting and found that the work had not progressed in my absence. I could not have remained, but now I have only two nights and we must if possible see some poor sinners saved before I leave. O God! in mercy hear us and bless our efforts.</p>

<p><b>27.</b> Had to go forty miles today to an appointment. Called on some of the brethren at Wayland. The day was cold.</p>

<p><b>30.</b> Last night I had a precious dream of meeting my angel love, Sarah. Oh, how happy I was to return to that kind family I have been so long separated, and with whom my soul longs to be! Now are only seven Sabbaths until I start. Oh, how our hearts yearn to be together! Lord, speed the time. Never did woman have purer and stronger love for man than that of my dearest Sarah for me&#8212;yes, even me. O Lord, what a blessing thou hast here bestowed on thy unworthy servant! What a bliss to me, that I should thus be loved, and that, too, by the very creature that I would rather have love me than any fair female in all the world! O Lord! this is thy doing and it is wonderful in our eyes. How happy I would be this morning were my beautiful, virtuous, and loving companion by my side! How hard it is to stay apart so long! God give grace and strength of mind to endure this torture of separation.</p>

<p><b>April 3, 1874.</b> What a bright and beautiful morn! I am surrounded by beautiful scenery. The family lives right on the bank of a stream, tributary to the Blue. The house sits on the edge of a bank about twenty feet on the north; on the south the stream making a loop comes around just far enough from the south side to make a nice little yard. To the east is a beautiful, large yard. To the west is quite a picturesque scene; the stream, running very crooked, doubles around with but narrow, high banks between, and all covered with timber, some of the largest trees I have seen in the State, some oaks four feet across, yet not one of them enough to make a rail cut, branching out a few feet from the ground. The whole presents a romantic scene, Brother Querry settled here five years ago, when there were only a few families in the country. The settling up of the country has far surpassed in rapidity the wildest imagination. Bro. George Fellows and I went out on a hunt for prairie chickens and wild geese. We went in the buggy, by which we can approach nearer to the chickens than otherwise. Had a few shots at wild geese but killed nothing.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> Sabbath. Easter. Bright, warm, and beautiful morning. Preached at eleven on the Church of God, diagrammed on blackboard. The truth was well received. There is a fine prospect for the Church of God. Dr. Stone who is no professor of religion but a thorough student of the Bible, and one whom I think will soon give himself to the Lord, is one with us in sentiment. Another good old Methodist Episcopal brother who preaches some sanctioned my sermon all through, even my strongest denunciation of creeds, sects, etc. Brother Stoner, a Disciple, was well pleased with the church but took exceptions to feet-washing, reception of the Spirit by faith before baptism, and the divine call to the ministry. He invited me home with him and we talked over the matter and he conceded my position on all these points. His companion before held with us on all these points.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> Came to Brother Hoffer&#8217;s. Selected a place for my house and staked off a yard, etc.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> Wrote some letters. This was a warm and beautiful day. Oh, how lovely the spring after the long, cold winter; emblem of the time of the Lord&#8217;s coming, the time of singing of birds! The turtle-dove is heard in the land, all to remind us of the Lord&#8217;s coming.</p>

<p>The approach of summer also gladdens my heart because it is bringing us near the happy time when I shall be joined in holy matrimony with the pure and warm-hearted Sarah, whose constant and ardent love is worth more to me than all the treasures and honor of earth. Could I hold converse with that bright luminary whose beams and gentle rays fall so graciously upon the earth today, I would ask if the revolving earth brought another creature under his shining light so pure, fair, and lovely as my own blessed Sarah.</p>

<p><b>13.</b> This morn is rainy. Drove to Wayland, fifteen miles, and then worked all day at my house. Brothers H. and M. Hoffer and Brother Berry had just got the lumber [hauled from Seward] on the ground and begun the work. We worked through the damp weather and got it finished, a stove up, and a bed by 10 P.M., when the brethren left, and I retired to sleep, the first night in my life in my own house and on my own land. Thank God for these blessings! May God help me to use it as not abusing it.</p>

<p><b>14.</b> Returned to my house and made a stand. P.M., went to Barber&#8217;s, where I preached at night on the signs of the coming of Christ. Had a house full of very attentive hearers. Spoke two hours. All seemed highly interested.</p>

<p><b>15.</b> In the eve drove about seven miles over into York County and preached to a crowded house in the Parker Schoolhouse.</p>

<p><b>16.</b> Went to Mr. Mahaffey&#8217;s and had a good visit. He is a lawyer, a smart man, well informed in the Bible. Agrees with me on doctrine. He promised that he would give his heart to Jesus. Wishes to borrow some of my books to inform himself for the service of God. I pray God that he may be soundly converted and become useful. I had left no appointment, but several came together and begged me to leave another appointment before going east. I never saw people more eager for the gospel than here. Many have fallen in love with the Church of God and desire me to form a church here. P.M., went home and worked some at my house.</p>

<p><b>28.</b> Drove to Brother J. A. Mark&#8217;s. The day passed off very pleasantly. Spent the time in meditation and singing praise to God. Drove about forty-five miles and reached destination about 6 P.M. There seemed to be no fatigue to me nor to my steed, Mattie Blaze. The roads were beautiful and the day delightful. How balmy the air! There perhaps never was another such delightful country to travel in. Found no one at home at Brother Mark&#8217;s. Put up Mattie Blaze, compromised with the big dog, Watch, and took possession of the house. Ere long the family came home, having been at a neighbor&#8217;s. They were well and glad to see me.</p>

<p><b>May 1, 1874.</b> Came to Grand Island, in Hall County, about fifteen miles northwest of Brother Mark&#8217;s. Found Brother John Kramer and family well. They are a very fine people, firm in the principles of the Church of God. They have a beautiful place one and one fourth miles from the city. All that is wanting is a Church of God here. I feel sorry that they cannot be supplied. But this is a hard place to do anything unless we have a house of worship. Brother K. could find no place in the city to have an appointment, so he has an appointment in his own house for Lord&#8217;s day. Sectarian bigotry abounds here in the West; each sect, fearing the rottenness of its own foundation, is not willing to have it tried by the gospel.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> Wrote, read, meditated, and prayed in a pleasant room at Brother K&#8217;s. How pleasant it is to have a place of solitary retirement, so seldom enjoyed in the small sod houses of this frontier country! This afternoon there was a good deal of excitement in Grand Island on the occasion of breaking ground for a new railroad, the St. Joseph and Grand Island Railroad. It is now in operation from St. Joseph to Hastings. Grand Island is beautifully situated on the Union Pacific Railroad and on the north side of Platte River. It has a bright prospect for a large city and important railroad center.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> Sabbath. Rainy in A.M., hence no preaching. Spent the day pleasantly with the kind Kramer family singing and talking on Scripture.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> Started this beautiful morn to Fillmore County. Took my dinner and fed Mattie Blaze on Sec. 12, Twp. 9. Range 6 W. Two miles east is the nicest railroad section I ever saw. I crossed the South Blue River in a beautiful grove, which was quite green. The place was so beautiful that I could not resist the temptation to stop in the shade by the cool stream. I wondered if I should ever have the pleasure of crossing through this beautiful grove with my lovely Sadie, who of course is always brought to my mind when I meet anything that is lovely and beautiful, for she is the fairest and most lovely piece of God&#8217;s creation.</p>

<p>Two graceful ducks were swimming in the water. This as well as the cooing dove near by brought forcibly to my mind my beloved, who is far away. The dove&#8217;s cooing was an index to my heart, that longed to be with her, so clear to me. Even the beautiful stream suggested to me our two beings that were soon to blend fully into one to follow on in everlasting love, like two streams of water that mingle together and flow on in the same channel.</p>

<p>These lines are being penned in this beautiful grove while many feathered songsters are singing their sweet songs over my head. Thank God for the beauties of nature and all that they have brought to my mind.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> Received a letter from Brother J. A. Shuler, treasurer, with an order in my favor for fifty dollars. Thank the kind Lord and all who gave to this fund.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> Came to Indian Creek. Found all well and anxious for my coming. All seemed faithful.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> Sabbath. Sabbath-school at ten. Preached on <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+28%3A12-13">Genesis 28:12-13</a>. A strange brother arose and said he would like to speak a few words. He remarked that for some time he had been searching for the truth and the old paths and that he precisely agreed with me that there is but one church, i.e., the church of God, so named by the mouth of the Lord, governed alone by the Word of God, including all who have the Spirit of Christ, by which they are baptized into the body, the church. The brother talks some to the people and accepted an invitation to preach in two weeks. Thank God for more laborers to contend for the truth.</p>

<p>After this went to Indian Creek, where I had the great pleasure of immersing [names seven persons]. At last baptizing Brother Winters told me that he had been baptized by his parents when a child, and now they were dead and gone, and out of respect for them he would never be baptized again. I told him to read his Bible and see whether that satisfied the demands of God upon him. I further reminded him that religion was a personal matter. He acted upon these suggestions and the result was he was anxious to obey God. Oh, how the commands of God are made void by the traditions of men! The baptizing was one of great interest. All were happy. Eve, had a good speaking-meeting. Some said it was the happiest day of their lives. Preached on the ordinances and had a heavenly time in observing them. Bade the brethren and sisters farewell.</p>

<p><b>13.</b> Was to have a breaking bee, but it rained all forenoon. P.M., worked on my claim. Eve, preached from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+20%3A32">Acts 20:32</a>. We got lost going home with Brother Hoffer. Got home by eleven. It was raining and very dark.</p>

<p><b>18.</b> Went to Seward in the morning. Spent the day preparing for my journey. Eve, preached in Seward and returned home.</p>

<p><b>19.</b> The happy time has come at last that I start back to my beloved Sarah. May God&#8217;s kind care be over me by the way. Took train at half-past nine at Seward. This is the morning I have been thinking about so long. The hard labor of another year is over. Since last July 4 preached one hundred and fifty-five sermons.</p>

<p><b>20.</b> Nebraska City. Visited a beautiful orchard of eighty acres. Am enjoying my visit much with Brother John F. Kimmel and family. Took a pleasant ride.</p>

<p><b>21.</b> Today the Board of Missions meets in Chicago. Wish I could he there to report in person; but I sent out my report yesterday. At 7:20 P.M. started on my journey. Came via Hamburg, St. Joseph, and Kansas City where I arrived at early daylight.</p>

<p><b>22.</b> Took the Missouri Pacific through the State of Missouri. Train stopped for dinner at Jefferson City. Ran through tunnels, under rocks. Many places the rocks stood a perpendicular wall one hundred feet on one side of the cars and on the other the Missouri River. Missouri in some parts seems to be a beautiful State; but taking it altogether it falls far short of Nebraska as an agricultural state. It is rather rough. Had three fourths of an hour in St. Louis. Purchased a suit for thirty-five dollars, also a small present for my beloved Sarah, a collar, $1.50, and cravat, $1.50. Took train on Toledo, Wabash, and Western at 7 P.M. Crossed the Mississippi on a transfer boat near the great iron bridge, which is a, wonderful structure. Took sleeping car and lay down with a heart full of gratitude to God for his protection through the dangers of the day and humbly entreating his care through the night.</p>

<p><b>23.</b> Reached Fort Wayne at 7 A.M. Staid over till 12:30 P.M. Then came on with a light heart. Arrived at Upper Sandusky at 4:50 P.M. Rode out to Brother Keller&#8217;s with Brother Hoffman. And now the long contemplated time of meeting my beloved Sarah has come at last. Thank the kind Lord for his care and protection over us through these eleven long months that we have been so far, far apart.</p>

<p>This eve went to see Father Shriner, who is nearing the other shore to dwell with the spirits made perfect. Had a season of prayer. Returned with Brother Keller.</p>

<p><b>25.</b> Father Shriner died at 4 A.M. yesterday, and at 11 A.M. today Brother Small preached the funeral, followed by Brother Updike and me. It was a very large funeral. Father S. was an upright and godly man, firmly devoted to truth and right. Well do I remember words that fell from his lips some four years ago when, during his report, he remarked: &#8220;Brethren, I have always tried to maintain a ministerial character.&#8221; These words, backed up by his exemplary life, had a great meaning and made a deep impression on my mind. They inspired me with new determination to live out the same character by the grace of God.</p>

<p><b>26.</b> Spent the day pleasantly at Brother Keller&#8217;s. Oh, how happy I am to have the blessed company of my dearly beloved Sadie! Surely I should be a happy and grateful man, having such a rich treasure.</p>

<p><b>28.</b> Took train for Crestline, where I am now writing these lines, waiting for the train to Shelby. But here it comes! Twelve o&#8217;clock, aboard the train. Oh, how convenient to the great cause of God is the railroad! Reached Daniel Baker&#8217;s, at Shelby, at 1 P.M. We were happy to meet again.</p>

<p>Nearly one year has passed since my last visit here in company with Bro. J. L. Jenner, who is now in eternity. Poor fellow, he became insane last April and on the 25th cut his throat and abdomen, from the effects of which he died some days later. From the best information I could get his mind was overcome by an unwillingness to preach the whole gospel of God, through a desire to gain the applause of man. As ministers of God we should take warning and fill our high calling in the fear of God.</p>

<p><b>29.</b> Came to W. Auburn, where I met many of the dear brethren beloved as children. Preached from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+144%3A15">Psalm 144:15</a>. How happy and grateful I am to meet with these beloved people!</p>

<p><b>30.</b> This morn I went up into my old room at Brother Peter Wright&#8217;s and looked over all my mementos of my dear departed companion and sonny.</p>

<p><b>31.</b> Sabbath. Had a good speaking-meeting. Preached on the signs of the coming of Christ. The house was crowded. Eve, Brother Awkerman preached on the ordinances, after which we had a happy time in obeying them. Human language cannot express my joy.</p>

<p><b>June 3, 1874.</b> Yesterday and today the women were busily engaged in preparations for our wedding.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> This is the happy day to which my mind has so often soared ahead of time to embrace in sweet anticipation. Thank God that the onward flight of time has brought the day in which my angel Sarah<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../texts/Birth_of_a_Reformation/D_S_Warners_Second_Wife_Sarah/index.html">*</a> and I shall be joined in holy wedlock. I was out early to breathe the balmy air. At the rising of the sun there was a heavy fog which all disappeared in a very short time, leaving the morning bright and lovely. All nature seemed cheerful. Never have I heard the birds sing so sweet and melodious as this morn in the woods over the way from Father Keller&#8217;s brick farmer&#8217;s home. It seemed that the dear little feathered songsters were congratulating me for the rich fortune the day brings to me. Went to Upper Sandusky in the morning. Weather hot. [Here he mentions a list of the guests from Auburn, Tiffin, and elsewhere.] At four the ceremony was performed, Brother Burchard officiating. Brother and Sister Tomlinson groomsman and groomsmaid. All passed off pleasantly. Received many warm congratulations, after which we proceeded to partake of the rich preparations in the dining room.</p>

<p>The evening was pleasantly spent sitting in the cool shade on the east of the house. Now a new leaf is turned, a new era begun, in the history of my life. O Lord, how can I thank thee enough for the great gift of my own pure, amiable, fair, and lovely Sarah! May God assist me to make her life happy as far as it is in the power of man to do so. God bless our union and make us together happy and useful.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> This morning still bright and clear. We started for Brother Wright&#8217;s. Stopped at noon at Bucyrus. Reached my old home at W&#8212;&#8212;&#8217;s about four. Our arrival was greeted with ringing and cheers from the boys. A rich infare [reception] supper was prepared. The evening was pleasantly spent singing and with music from two violins by Brothers Alvin Burch and Burchard.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> Sabbath. Good speaking-meeting in the grove [near New Washington]. Preached on baptism. After speaking one hour a small storm arose, which threw the congregation into confusion. We dismissed the people to meet at three by the side of the Maumee River. There being a grove there I proceeded to finish my discourse and spake about an hour, after which I baptized the following ten [names omitted]. Eve, I spoke on the washing of the saints&#8217; feet, after which observed the same. This was a good meeting. About a thousand people were present.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> Took train for Bryan, where we were met by my brother, who conveyed us to my parents, in Bridgewater Township, Williams Co. Thank God for a safe return to my parents once more.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> Visited Brother Joseph. Eve, we took a walk to a beautiful cemetery on my brother&#8217;s place. A new grave was there that awoke a train of interesting thoughts to my mind. It was the resting-place of Frances Stocking. She was the object of my affections and attentions at the time I gave my heart to God (February 1865). She was handsome and accomplished, having a very strong mind and good education. Her father was skeptical, and the dire disease was transmitted to Frank and I think the whole family. Having talked matrimony together and supposing she and I had the proper affections, I supposed it my duty to marry her notwithstanding her infidelity and her rapidly failing health. Out of sympathy for her suffering, which she claimed would be removed by marriage, I pledged her my heart and hand. But I asked to defer our marriage until I pursued my studies a few years. Ere many months had passed I began to doubt the existence of the proper elements of union in our case. I took the matter to the Lord and was soon confirmed in the belief that our marriage was not ordained of God. Our attachments grew weaker and soon correspondence ceased and she became married to a rough young man by the name of Baker. They moved to the West, ere long parted, and she came back a year ago. When at home I learned that she was a spiritualist and by spells was crazy, in which condition she was hurried to the grave, a poor wreck, morally, mentally, and physically.</p>

<p><b>17.</b> Passed once more the old schoolhouse where I gave my heart to God (February 1865). Thank God for that step. Oh how glad I am that it was ever my lot to become a Christian! A beautiful house of worship stands near the place, belonging to the Church of God.</p>

<p><b>25.</b> This is my birthday. Thirty-two years have passed over my head. How the time has flown! Oh God! blot out of my past years all that is wrong and help me give all that remain to thee and thy cause.</p>

<p><b>July 8, 1874.</b> This is my dear Sarah&#8217;s birthday. She is nineteen years of age.</p>

<p><b>24.</b> Brother Lewis Williams took us and our goods to New Washington. Had a good talk at the depot with Brother A&#8212;&#8212;. He seemed very much dissatisfied with my having organized a church in Upper Sandusky. Intimated that it would make me trouble. Oh, that God would save his preachers from envy and vindictive cruelty in biting and devouring each other! Whatever the Eldership may do in my case, I am certain that I did what I have done through pure motives to the glory&#8217; of God, for the good of his cause, and I believe with his approbation.</p>

<p><b>30.</b> This morn went to West Unity, thence to Father John Kerr&#8217;s in Fulton County. Eve, went to prayer meeting. Heard a good number of my scholars testify for Jesus, thank God. Meeting was led by Brother G. W. Dustin, who is a noble young man. Since he attended my school, I have felt impressed that God desired to make a minister out of him. I pray that God may lead him into all truth.</p>

<p><b>August 11, 1874.</b> Father, Mother and Brother Joseph brought us to Bryan. Bade farewell to the friends once again. Reached Goshen about four. Found Mr. Guiss, my brother-in-law. Reached his home in New Paris about dusk. My sister&#8217;s health is poor.</p>

<p><b>15.</b> Preached in New Paris from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+24%3A3">Matthew 24:3</a>. Four young brethren and two sisters were there from Syracuse.</p>

<p><b>16.</b> Brother Keller came after us early this morning to convey us out to Syracuse, where I preached at 10:30 A.M.; <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+144%3A15">Psalm 144:15</a>. Went home with Charles Strombeck, whose companion is sick. Prayed for her. She seemed strengthened. Four brethren each put a dollar into my hand. Returned to town. Eve, preached on <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+43%3A10-11">Ezekiel 43:10-11</a>. Diagramed on the board. House full. A collection was taken up for me. Never did I find such overabundant kind and benevolent people. They seem as near to me as though I had preached for years in their midst. God will surely bless them and greatly reward I their kind liberality.</p>

<p><b>17.</b> Took train at 10:20 A.M., reached Elkhart at eleven, laid over until 4:13 P.M. Reached Chicago 8 P.M.; Brother Shoemaker met us at the train and conducted us to his house.</p>

<p><b>18.</b> In company with Brother S., visited the scene of the late fire. Visited the great water-works, also the exposition building, the largest building I was ever in. Walked through the tunnel and visited the Union, Michigan, and Jefferson Parks, where was much of interest. Traveled by streetcar and on foot about ten miles. Took train on the Burlington at 10 P.M.</p>

<p><b>19.</b> Reached Red Oak, Iowa, 7 P.M. Put up at the Tremont House. A lady was shot in the place tonight by one whom she had opposed as a suitor for her daughter. Four balls were fired, some of which took effect in the neck. She may possibly recover. The assassin was arrested and confined.</p>

<p><b>20.</b> Took train for Nebraska City. Western Iowa is beautiful; Sarah much admires it. Reached the Missouri River at ten, and Brother Kimmel&#8217;s in Nebraska City at eleven. Took train for Seward. The country looks beautiful. One thing strikes the mind as different from Iowa and Illinois, and that is the great abundance of wheat on this side of the Missouri River. Corn is raised in abundance in those States; but little proportionately is raised here, and will be almost an entire failure this year owing to the drought and grasshoppers. As soon as we crossed the Missouri we landed among swarms of those insects. Landed safely at Seward at 10 P.M. Thank God for his kind care over us, permitting us safely to return to my field of labor.</p>

<p><b>21.</b> This morning Sarah and I walked over the prairie two miles to Brother William Anderson&#8217;s.</p>

<p><b>22.</b> P.M., we went out to visit a colony of prairie dogs. Eve, preached from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+1%3A3">II&nbsp;Peter 1:3</a>.</p>

<p><b>24.</b> Went to Seward, Wife and I and Brother J. W. K&#8212;&#8212;. He leaves on the train this morn for Ohio to take a wife, a dear sister, Eliza T&#8212;&#8212;, who was converted under my labors and is a special friend of mine. About a year ago I introduced them to each other, since which time they have corresponded and now have pledged themselves to live in unison for life. I pray God that their union may result in unbroken happiness and usefulness.</p>

<p><b>26.</b> Wife and I came to Polk County. Wife is pleased with the home, but fears we shall not be able to build. I pray God he may send help from some source.</p>

<p><b>29.</b> Drove about twenty-three miles, to Fillmore. Preached in the old sod schoolhouse. The brethren and sisters were glad to see me, as I also was to see them. Brother Grigg has been preaching for them during my absence. He does well and is sound in the Scriptures. I am glad that I found him out before I left.</p>

<p><b>31.</b> At 3 P.M. started for Seward County, thirty-eight miles. At sunset stopped and ate our supper by the way. Turned out Mattie Blaze to pick grass. Then came on. The curtains of night were soon thrown about us. It was cloudy. and not being able to see my guiding stars we lost our way. When I discovered the North Star we traveled some distance by it with no road at all. We went several miles out of our way and landed at Bro. J. Anderson&#8217;s after twelve.</p>

<p><b>September 4, 1874.</b> Drove twenty-six miles to Polk County.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> Went over to our house and found our goods; Brother Fox had brought them from Seward. Found everything all right. Read in the Testament. Finished it today. Had finished and recommenced it last Thanksgiving Day. Oh, that I had more time, and would better improve in the future what I have, to read the precious Bible!</p>

<p><b>10.</b> Started to York Center. Rained. Turned in to Brother Samuel Marble&#8217;s. No one at home. Soon he came. Left us in search of his wife. Did not find her till between three and four. We spent the time pleasantly in his old dugout. Instead of being lonesome it was pleasant to be found alone even in an old wet dugout and on a dreary day. It appeared like a small taste of the bliss that a home of our own would yield us. The greatest difficulty was something to eat. Plums were plentiful, else we could find nothing. When they returned they felt very bad that they happened to be away from home. They spared no pains to make us welcome and comfortable. Supper was served, after which the rain and darkening shades of night prevented our return.</p>

<p><b>12.</b> Sabbath. Started early for Polk County. Received some letters, one from Father and Mother Keller. All are well but seem to have no sympathy for us here on the frontier, not even a disposition to do justice by us. Lord, forgive them. We will suffer all things for thy sake. O God, my heart is bruised and crushed! We seem to meet with no sympathy from friends or brethren. Many have grown cold. Brothers H&#8212;&#8212; and O&#8212;&#8212; would not go to meeting. Went on to the Bense Schoolhouse. Preaching time, but no one there. Two neighbors came, no member of the Church of God. O Lord, the waves are rolling over me! All things against us. Some are offended because we will not recognize the devil&#8217;s secret gods with which they have been polluted. Others are backslidden. Lord, the troubles of my heart are enlarged! It is more than I can bear. I cannot restrain my grief for the desolation of Zion. The people are now gathering, but my tears prevent the reading of a hymn. Companion and a few brothers and sisters shed their tears with me.</p>

<p><b>14.</b> Wrote for <i>Advocate</i>.</p>

<p><b>15.</b> Sister Berry, Sarah, and I went to Lincoln Creek. Got tub of plums.</p>

<p><b>18.</b> Tried to get lumber on time, but could not. Felt very much cast down. No money yet from the Board. Friends in the East have no sympathy for us. Brethren here have no means. Winter is coming on soon and no home for my dear Sarah and me! With a heavy heart we started out to Brother J. H. Anderson&#8217;s. Heard he was not at home. Went on to Brother Green&#8217;s. As soon as he found I could not build they kindly invited us to move into their north room, which is a pleasant room with bedroom above and cellar privileges. Thanks be unto God! &#8220;Behind a frowning providence he hides a smiling face.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/God_Moves_in_a_Mysterious_Way/index.html" title="God Moves in a Mysterious Way">*</a></p>

<p><b>19.</b> Sabbath. Eve, preached at the Osborne Schoolhouse, up Lincoln Creek, a new point. Stayed at Mr. O&#8212;&#8212;&#8217;s, who is a Campbellite. Had some talk, but a few Scriptures silenced his doctrine.</p>

<p><b>20.</b> Gathered some grapes for Sarah. Came home to Brother Green&#8217;s.</p>

<p><b>21.</b> Sarah and I went to Polk County.</p>

<p><b>22.</b> Spent in our house preparing to take things back to Brother Green&#8217;s, Seward County. Sarah and I slept in our house all night.</p>

<p><b>23.</b> Staid all day again at house. Brother J. W. Figard came to take our things.</p>

<p><b>27.</b> Came to Seward County, Brother Green&#8217;s. Stopped at noon in the timber of the Blue River.</p>

<p><b>October 1, 1874.</b> Eldership meets in West Ohio. May God bless their deliberations. Worked till noon. At 3:15 P.M. started for York County, twenty-six miles. Could not reach it. Stopped at Brother Everett&#8217;s.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> About this time the West Ohio Eldership has passed through another session. I now begin another year&#8217;s work.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> Drove home. Found my dear companion well. How happy we are to be alone this eve in our little home! How sweet the home where love reigns! Oh the love that unites our hearts! How pure and strong, and still increasing! How happy I am! How blessed and favored!</p>

<p><b>6.</b> Worked at cupboard and helped my dear wash.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> Provided and arranged things for wife. Dear creature wept this morn that I had to be away again so soon and long.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> Came to Brother Berry&#8217;s [Polk County]. P.M., in my house. Wrote some letters. Preached in the Bense Schoolhouse, <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+2%3A11-14">II&nbsp;Peter 2:11-14</a>. Staid in my house tonight.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> Visited and talked with nearly all the members of the church. Many are cold and indifferent. Many have strife and bickerings. Oh, shame! Great God, save this church, of whose piety and devotion I have so often boasted. Some are spiteful at me because I touched the god of this world. Brother M&#8212;&#8212; raved and foamed over at me. God pity and forgive the poor graceless man. Thank God for grace to endure unruffled his abuse. Staid all night in my house.</p>

<p><b>12.</b> Started for home, anxious to see my blessed wife. This is the longest we have been apart since our marriage&#8212;five days. How long the time seems to me, notwithstanding I have been very busy! How lonely she must be! God bless her. Came by way of Seward. Dear Sarah had been way out on the prairie waiting for me.</p>

<p><b>20.</b> Started for the Oliver Schoolhouse, about twelve and one half miles to the northwest. Dear wife felt so bad to see me leave. The dear creature wept bitterly. Oh, how it pained my heart to leave her feeling so sad! Green&#8217;s folks were absent, which made it more lonely. O God, must I tear myself away from the dear wife bathed in tears? But &#8217;tis the cause of Christ and I must go. O Lord, comfort her loving heart.</p>

<p><b>24.</b> Started for Fillmore County. Drove against a very heavy wind.</p>

<p><b>25.</b> Sabbath. At 11 A.M. preached, <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+48%3A14">Psalm 48:14</a>. The old sod was full of hearers.</p>

<p><b>26.</b> Drove to Brothers&#8230;&#8203;and gathered quite a good load of vegetables and feed that these good brethren gave us. Came to Brother Weeter&#8217;s, where the donation was increased and Brother W. having business at Seward hauled it over for us. God bless these kind people. I fed and ate my dinner on the Blue River. Reached home 3 P.M., found dear wife well.</p>

<p><b>31.</b> Spent the day at Brothers M&#8212;&#8212; and B&#8212;&#8212;&#8217;s. Busy studying sermon. Eve, preached on <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+9%3A6-7">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>. Studied till twelve at night on sermon for Sabbath eve.</p>

<p><b>November 1, 1874.</b> Sabbath. This morn arose early and prepared a sermon on the subject of the Sabbath.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> At three started home. Arrived at dark. Dear wife was very lonesome and almost despaired of my coming home that day. Thank God, we are blessed with a home and a thousand domestic comforts. Oh, what a blessing is home when illuminated with the pure love of an affectionate companion!</p>

<p><b>3.</b> Went to Seward, where were two barrels of apples sent to me by a kind friend in Ohio. May the Lord bless his soul and reward him. He not only donated the apples but paid one dollar for the barrels and $1.25 freight to Chicago. The cost here was $4.20. Not having the money to lift [transport] them we let Brother Anderson have one barrel to lift them for us.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> At 11 A.M., started for Crete. Stopped in a deep draw at 1 P.M. to feed Mattie Blaze and eat our dinner. Sarah and I ate a whole chicken, some bread and butter, and finished off with an apple apiece. Went via Milford and Camden. Passed through a very large colony of prairie dogs. Enjoyed a leisure visit among this brisk and numerous little folk.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> Was glad to meet our dear and esteemed old Brother Moore, of whom I had heard so much. He is a very intelligent old pilgrim, greatly in love with the doctrines of the Church of God. It was through his earnest appeals that missionaries were sent to this part of Nebraska. At 4 P.M. we met in the Bethel to take the preliminary steps to the formation of an Eldership in Nebraska. Organized by the election of Brother K. A. Moore speaker and Brother McElwee and myself clerks.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> Met at 9 A.M. for business. The day was passed off very pleasantly. Love seasoned all our deliberations. According to committee on program, I delivered a discourse on church polity. Missionaries reported, and other business transacted. Closed by a touching speech from Brother Moore and prayer by me. The meeting was very edifying to us all and greatly strengthened the brotherly ties.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> Met early this morning in the Bethel for a social meeting. Good time. Brother Moore left us for home. God bless the old pilgrim and spare his life yet many years to bless his cause. Brother McE. and I spent the day in transcribing the minutes of the Eldership.</p>

<p>I preached in the Bethel, <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Chronicles+29%3A5">I&nbsp;Chronicles 29:5</a>. God blessed my soul. This afternoon I had a special season of secret prayer and communion with my God. Oh, how near he came to his poor servant! This eve I was unusually blessed in presenting the thoughts he had given me on the text, <span class="scripture">&#8220;And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day to the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Chronicles+29%3A5" title="I&nbsp;Chronicles 29:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Chronicles 29:5)</span></a></span> A deep interest prevailed. A Mr. B&#8212;&#8212; living six miles from town went, borne with an arrow in his heart. I expect to hear of his early conversion.</p>

<p><b>13.</b> Made out program for Ministerial Association to be held next spring in Seward.</p>

<p><b>14.</b> Came home. Pretty cold. Captured a wild duck which had its wing broken that day by some hunter. Reached home at nearly dusk.</p>

<p><b>15.</b>&#8230;&#8203;This was an earnest day&#8217;s work. I pray God that it may bring forth fruit to his glory.</p>

<p><b>December 25, 1874.</b> This is Christmas. At eleven preached on the incarnation of Christ. Returned to Brother M. Hoffer&#8217;s, where the kindred, companion, and I partook of a good feast. Roasted fowls. All passed off pleasantly and in a Christian manner. I was solemn and meditative. We sang some. Eve, spoke on <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+14%3A23">John 14:23</a>. With solemn and feeling hearts and minds performed the ordinances of feet washing and the Lord&#8217;s Supper.</p>

<p><b>27.</b> Sabbath. I preached about two hours on the immortality of man. Read twenty-three Scriptures speaking of the Spirit and twelve of the soul, all positively declaring the spirituality of man&#8217;s nature. Also several places proving that the soul came forth from the body at death and is as much more important than the body as the man is than the tent in which he lives. Proved also the conscious existence of a soul in an intermediate state. When through, Mr. K&#8212;&#8212;, a poor silly Adventist, harangued some moments. How confused the wretched Adventist doctrine!</p>

<p><b>January 1, 1875.</b> Another year has rolled into eternity. God is still favoring us with his kind care and preservation. Oh, how many souls are in eternity today who with light hearts enjoyed friendly greetings and sumptuous festivities a year ago today! Some, alas, we fear, have been <span class="scripture">&#8220;cut down out of time,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Job+22%3A16" title="Job 22:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Job 22:16)</span></a></span> who had no Christ in the soul. Oh, what a mockery are all the pleasures of the wicked! True and warm hearts wished them a happy New Year one year ago today; but alas, their sins have made it the year of their doom to eternal misery. O God! Give us grace to enable us to spend our years to thy glory. Companion and I spent the day very pleasantly in Seward with&#8230;. The two ladies are sisters, and old friends and acquaintances of Ohio. They had a sumptuous feast. We sang a few hymns, read a chapter, and knelt in prayer to our Father in heaven. Then came home.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> Took Sarah to Brother Anderson&#8217;s and started to visit the church in Fillmore County, a distance of about thirty miles. Stopped in Nickleville and fed Mattie Blaze. Warmed and ate my dinner in a store. Reached Brother Weeter&#8217;s a little after dark. The brother was gone and I was so cold I could hardly put my pony away. Sister W. soon got me some supper, and after eating hastily I set out afoot one and one half miles to the schoolhouse. Found three brethren there. No light. Gave them a short discourse from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A35">Hebrews 10:35</a>.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> Sabbath. Some brethren tried for two hours to get the old sod schoolhouse warm, but the stove was so poor they failed. They then came up to Brother Horton&#8217;s, where I spoke to a little band of brethren and sisters from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+9%3A16-17">Hebrews 9:16-17</a>. Started for Brother Moffitt&#8217;s. Quite cold and stormy. Stopped at Brother P. H. Griggs. Talked till a late hour on Scripture. The brother is troubled with the no-organization doctrine advocated by Johnson, editor of the <i>Stumbling Stone</i>. The brother confessed that elders and deacons are authorized in the New Testament as the completion of the local organizations, and in short the polity of the Church of God is Bible.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> Went to Seward. Got coal and a box sent by Father and Mother Keller.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> Helped Wife wash. Read <i>Moral Philosophy</i>.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> Made apple butter of the frozen apples in the box sent by father-in-law.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> Very stormy and cold. Improved the time in mental and religious improvement.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> Sabbath. Strange to find myself at home with no appointment. Meditated what to do. Having appointments here a week from today, I concluded not to go this week to York County, but hoping we would be favored with good weather I dispatched Brother Green to circulate appointments for tonight and during the week at Occidental. Eve, pretty good turnout.</p>

<p><b>18.</b> Helped Wife wash. Read and wrote. Devotion was sweet and precious this morn.</p>

<p><b>19.</b> At 12:45 P.M. started for York County, about twenty-six miles. Reached destination at 6 P.M. Small turnout.</p>

<p><b>21.</b> This morn realized a precious nearness of Christ in family worship. Spent two hours in private room reading Testament and in prayer and meditation. It was a precious season.</p>

<p><b>25.</b> Praise God for the great triumphs in his cause! I am spending many hours on my knees praising God and imploring mercy for sinners. What a glorious work!</p>

<p><b>27.</b> Started for home. Dear Wife was much cast down owing to my stay being longer than I had intended. Dear affectionate creature! My absence seems to rob her of all the happiness of life. It would be nonetheless the case with me were it not for the absorbing cause of God during my absence.</p>

<p><b>29.</b> Strong wind from the west, and not feeling well I did not go to York County. Read and wrote.</p>

<p><b>30.</b> Quite stormy. Cannot go to the meeting today. Spent the day in reading and writing, prayer and meditation.</p>

<p><b>February 12, 1875.</b> Wife, I, and [names several others] went to visit about two hundred Omahas, camped on the Blue two miles from Seward. They were on their return from their winter&#8217;s hunt. Were well laden with robes and furs. It was an interesting visit. The squaws were busily engaged in dressing and tanning buffalo robes; the men stood and looked on. Poor creatures! They seemed to be but servants for the men. How wrong and cruel such a custom! We went into their wigwams; but few could, or at least would, speak English. The little papooses were amusing themselves by loading each other down with bundles of weeds, etc., in imitation of their pack-ponies. They also had a tent constructed out of blankets. One girl about twelve had a little papoose but a few weeks old tied on a board and hung on her back. Sometimes she would lay it down face up in the sun, other times she had it on her back engaged in play with other children. I could see a marked improvement in the rising generation in the moral and intellectual organs. Their more frequent contact with white people and a general tendency to improvement in the tribe renders the children far superior to their parents. Some I noticed were as well constituted as many white children. One boy of about thirteen could spell quite well. May the kind providence of God yet elevate this poor distressed people to a higher plane of intellectual, moral, and religious enjoyment. The Omahas are among our most honorable and refined tribes. Bought a fine robe for ten dollars. Cost in Ohio about nineteen.</p>

<p><b>16.</b> Brother Mc. and I came to the Oliver Schoolhouse. It was nearly enough to break my blessed wife&#8217;s heart to have me leave her. Oh Lord, comfort her heart! Were it not that <span class="scripture">&#8220;necessity is laid upon me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+9%3A16" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 9:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 9:16)</span></a></span> I could not leave her. House nearly full. <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+85%3A6-8">Psalm 85:6-8</a>. Came home with friend Mitchel. Turned cold.</p>

<p><b>17.</b> The house being a small shell, I suffered much last night with cold. Arose and got overcoat. Fared some better but ached much and slept little. Spent the day till 4 P.M. at Mr. M&#8217;s. Talked much on religion. He acknowledged that he always read the Bible to condemn religion till I preached here last fall. He is not convicted. Hope he will soon yield to God.</p>

<p><b>18.</b> I find that I have taken a severe cold from my cold night&#8217;s lodging. After dinner examined Brother Hibbard&#8217;s head. A meeting two and one half miles south has been in progress some over two weeks and for a few nights there has been some interest, hence I must go there.</p>

<p><b>21.</b> Sabbath. Had good speaking-meeting. Preached on <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+6%3A16">Jeremiah 6:16</a>. Was sent for to visit a sin-sick soul one and one half miles south. Brother Oliver and I went, found him, Brother John Cowan, scarcely able to be up, in great distress of mind. We read the Word, talked, sang, and prayed until God blessed his soul, and we all rejoiced. His mother shouted and anon praised God for &#8220;Winebrennerian religion,&#8221; declaring it was the old kind and as good as Methodist Episcopal or any other. It was amusing to see them all come down from deep-rooted prejudices. The brother&#8217;s feet and anklebones having received strength, and he having eaten some, came with us to meeting.</p>

<p><b>22.</b> Had family prayer meeting at 11 A.M. Examined Brother Mitchell and gave him a phrenological chart.</p>

<p><b>23.</b> Stormy. A few of us met for prayer. Staid all day at Brother Hibbard&#8217;s. No meeting. Oh, how I longed to be with blessed companion this dreary day and night! Through the night I spent hours listening to the muttering storm. Recalled all the draws between there and home, wondered if any were filled so as to be impassable. Determined to go home the next day if the driving snow would allow me to see three rods.</p>

<p><b>24.</b> Morning came and the storm nearly subsided. Started for home. Mattie Blaze got into a snowdrift in which she could not reach the ground. Could not go through. Had to get out and get her loose from the buggy. Took her to Brother Hafer&#8217;s, nearby. Warmed myself, then drew the buggy back, hitched up, and drove out another way. Got home all right. Saw Sarah&#8217;s smiling face. Thank God, the dear creature is well.</p>

<p><b>March 2, 1875.</b> We had a glorious day meeting. How my heart leaped with joy to see my beloved Brother Anderson reclaimed again! He has been a special object of my prayers. He is a brother I dearly love.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> Good day meeting. Brother Briggs related how his little stepdaughter was blessed here yesterday. &#8220;She told her mother that she felt the Spirit of God knocking at her heart. Then Brother Warner came and took her by the hand and said, &#8216;Give your heart to Jesus,&#8217; and she said to Jesus, &#8216;Take my heart.&#8217; Then she felt so happy. She got up and spoke like a little soldier.&#8221; Sister Anderson also told of her little girl&#8217;s singing &#8220;Good News Gone to Canaan&#8221; last eve and she got happy and clapped her hands for joy.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> Went home with Brother James A&#8212;&#8212;. Tried to show the domestic duties of religion. It is a delicate task, but the shepherd often finds families that need plain talk on duties to each other and to God, in the family. Religion should find its most sacred altar in the family circle. There should its holy affections glow with the greatest warmth. If religion in all its tender affections and holy fruits does not burn on the family altar, the world will fail to see its light. God bless this family.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> Last night and today a terrible cloud rested on us all. We felt as though the devil had triumphed somewhere.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> Staid at home. Read and prayed. Felt much depressed. Something is wrong. Satan has a victory somewhere.</p>

<p><b>12.</b> The dark cloud, thank God, is passing. Find what the difficulty has been. Some of the young men who have been at the altar have been loafing and visiting saloons. Last night after meeting Sister Rebecca Anderson told them of their inconsistency, which I think has broken the devil&#8217;s chain; hence we had a good meeting today.</p>

<p><b>14.</b> Sabbath. Preaching at 11:30 A.M. <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+3%3A14-15">Ephesians 3:14-15</a>. Proved the oneness of Christians; the fact that this oneness is not manifest to the world; that it should be; and how. After preaching Brother S. got up and harangued in favor of sects. He said I had doubt of my sincerity. He believed I was a true Christian if there was one in the world, but what I had preached got him down in the heels. He made no attempt to prove nor even assert that I had preached anything false. In fact, he never called up the question whether I had preached truth or not, only that my preaching made him and others feel bad. I told him that I had no doubt of it, for Paul had told us long ago that the time would come when men would not endure sound doctrine. Told him that I sympathized very much with him, that I had been in the same dread dilemma when I was not willing to accept the whole truth; it always hurt me to hear it. In answer to questions I made him acknowledge to the truth of all that I had preached before the congregation. After meeting, Brother B&#8212;&#8212;, another poor sectarianized soul, pitched into me. The people crowded around. I made him confess that Paul forbade Christians at Corinth to divide into sects. Brother Riley, a fine man recently converted, seemed highly elated to hear the glorious doctrine of the Word defended. He will soon come into fellowship with the church.</p>

<p>Bro. Lewis Anderson, who has enjoyed the meeting very much, staid away today and tonight. How fearful is a disturbed conscience! Brother Hafer, who is a good man filled with the Spirit, remarked a few days ago to Brother Houck that we were having a good meeting but he feared Brother Warner would spoil the good feeling by preaching on the church. Brother H. told him that he need have no fears. If Brother W. preached the truth, it should not hurt a Christian; if error, it is too weak to hurt anything. He advised him to come and hear for himself. He did so, sat with his head down, doubtless felt the force of truth but was too honest to trifle with it; confessed that I had preached nothing but Bible. Oh, that the world were freed from the curse of human creeds, that men could be at liberty to obey God! We had a good and pleasant meeting. My heart flowed with peace.</p>

<p><b>18.</b> Dear Sarah very sick most of the afternoon. [Confinement]. I too felt nearly overcome at her suffering. Had a season of prayer and was much comforted. Had the assurance that she would get along well from this time. She was no more so sick. At 6 P.M. the Lord delivered her of a large daughter, 8 pounds. Thank God for his goodness!</p>

<p>And now, O Lord! another sacred charge is committed to our trust. This day we acknowledge new responsibilities laid upon us. Thou hast committed to our care a pure and spotless soul. Give us grace and wisdom that we may bring up this dear child sound in body and mind, pure and innocent in heart and life, that thou, O God, its Maker, may be honored and glorified by its life and career on earth. O God! thou author of its being, this night I bow before thy throne and consecrate this precious household gem to thee. Thou hast given it to us, and we wait not for one sun to pass over its head until we lay it upon altar of consecration to God, that all its days may be thine. O God! we solemnly vow to rear this child for thee. Shouldst thou see fit to leave it to grow up under our care, we shall bless thee for its angelic society; and shouldst thou rather choose to take it to thyself in the dewy time of youth, O Lord! we cannot murmur; for thine it is and only entrusted to our care till it seemeth good for thee to commit it to wiser and more worthy care in a more congenial abode than this dreary, sinful earth. God bless the dear little creature!</p>

<p><b>19.</b> Took care of dear Wife.</p>

<p><b>20.</b> After taking care of Wife and child, went to Seward. When starting home Mattie Blaze stumbled, fell, and broke one of the shafts. Took buggy back to shop, left it, and rode home. Eve, preached at Occidental, returned at eleven greatly exhausted. Great weakness of back from stooping continually over the bed taking care of dear Wife and babe.</p>

<p><b>23.</b> Sarah feeling rather worse. P.M., went to Seward. Have taken a bad cold, being up so much of nights.</p>

<p><b>25.</b> Am constantly taking care of dear Wife and child. They are getting along fine, thank God. Quite warm. Birds are singing. Summer appears; nature is awakening from her long winter slumbers.</p>

<p><b>27.</b> For some days I have had a severe conflict in my mind concerning my leaving to fill appointments in Fillmore County. &#8217;Twas hard to think of leaving dear Wife yet confined to her bed, as our girl has made no attempts to take care of her or child because I preferred to do it and she had no experience. Hard as it seemed for dear Wife, duty seemed all along to say I should go. I determined to do so. Preparations were made to go, but when the moment was at hand Wife wept, and fearing a want of care and too much anxiety might bring on a relapse I felt it my solemn duty to stay and take care of her. P.M., went to Seward and tried to get a place to preach Sabbath eve, feeling that I dare not spend the Lord&#8217;s day without doing something for Christ; but I failed to get a place to preach.</p>

<p><b>28.</b> This is Easter Day. Spent the day in solitude with dear Wife and daughter. Wife feeling pretty well; sat up much of the day for the first except a short time yesterday. Think this is the second Sabbath in eight years that I have not preached the Word of God. The day was mostly spent in reading and meditation. Felt ill at ease that I could not be preaching somewhere.</p>

<p><b>31.</b> Terrible storm all day. About five inches of snow fell. Drifted much.</p>

<p><b>April 2, 1875.</b> Sister Sarah Anderson, our girl, became homesick and would stay no longer. Could not leave to fill appointments in York and Polk Counties. Deeply regretted that I could not be with the dear brethren, but could get no one to take care of Wife and child; besides, the roads were almost impassable.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> Pitched into housework as usual. Did the cooking and washed dishes. Sarah quite sick this A.M.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> Sabbath. Did up the work this morn, and though late I started for prayer meeting, thinking I could get there in time to have at least one prayer with the dear brethren. Found they had just closed their prayer meeting. I read a chapter, talked some, and sang and prayed with them. My heart was full. Having been kept at home from public worship for some weeks, I felt as a bird set at liberty. Bless God for the privilege of appearing in his courts to offer our sacrifice of praise! Returned home. Found dear Wife and child asleep, both feeling very well. The little creature slept right on till night. Sarah and I spent the time pleasantly reading and talking of our blessed hope of glory. My heart was light and happy. Bro. David Figard today kindly invited me to move into his house. Thank God for this kindness. The brethren know that we have not a very pleasant place to live, yet I have no room for complaints, but much occasion for thanks.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> P.M., heavy rains. About a mile to the southeast of Seward there was a great waterspout extending from a black cloud to the earth. It was a grand and sublime sight. As it followed a high ridge on the opposite side of the Blue River valley from us we had a beautiful view of it. We could see the water strike the ground and a dense spray arise around it resembling smoke. I have learned that it tore one house and a wagon to pieces.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> Drove to Brother Figard&#8217;s via Seward. Our ride of about seven miles was the first for our dear little Levilla Modest.</p>

<p><b>12.</b> About one last night I took quite sick with, I suppose, cholera morbus. Sick all day. Sorry I could not go to Polk County, but it is necessary that blessings disguised in affliction come at times as well as the almost constant blessing of health. Tonight, I think, is the third appointment in eight years that I have missed through my physical disability.</p>

<p><b>13.</b> Drove to York County. Called at Father Fenton&#8217;s, a United Brethren preacher, who is poorly. Found also another aged pilgrim in the family, who desired me to bring him some good books to read. Being anxious to bestow some kindness on this good old Methodist father, I left a book with him that I was taking home, having had it lent for some time. Had a season of prayer and then some conversation on the hope of the saints.</p>

<p><b>14.</b> Found that my appointment which I had failed to reach had proved a blessing after all, for they had a good prayer meeting. Appointed another for the following Sabbath eve, which was a success also and resulted in the organization of a Sabbath-school, which is under the officership of those who hold with the church of God. Prospects are good here. A railroad station is expected close by. P.M., drove to Fillmore County. How beautiful and pleasing, yea, charming, even to making happy, the day and the landscape!</p>

<p><b>17.</b> Brothers Figard and J. H. Anderson moved us today to Brother F&#8217;s.</p>

<p><b>20.</b> Drove to Polk County. Distance, twenty-eight miles. Found the brotherhood well and hungry for the gospel.</p>

<p><b>23.</b> Wife and I drove to Indian Creek, Fillmore County, distance, thirty-four miles.</p>

<p><b>26.</b> Wife and I went to Seward. Asked for the Presbyterian meetinghouse for Ministerial Association in case we are refused the Methodist Episcopal house. Found the latter wished to reserve some of the time hence accepted the Presbyterian house. Had programs printed.</p>

<p><b>27.</b> Drove to Polk County and planted fruit trees.</p>

<p><b>28.</b> Planted trees, potatoes, and garden seeds until after 4 P.M. At five minutes past five started for Wilson schoolhouse, about fifteen and one half miles. Reached in time. <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+1%3A13">I&nbsp;Peter 1:13</a>. This is a new point, with good prospects. &#8217;Tis only a half mile from where it is said there will be a station on the Midland Pacific, which is now being extended to York Center.</p>

<p><b>May 2, 1875.</b> Sabbath. Stormy. Went home with Brother Price, it being handy and the weather bad. Several came there to spend the afternoon. The time passed off very pleasantly singing, and I lectured some on moral and mental culture. Examined some heads.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> A.M., wrote letters. P.M., went to Seward. Completed arrangements for Ministerial Association.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> Sarah and I drove over to the Blue. Had a pleasant time fishing. Caught a mess.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> Visited Brother Mitchell&#8217;s. Left Wife there and drove over to visit Brother Lichty. He was one of our seekers when I closed the meeting last winter. I was anxious to see him; but he being from home, I was disappointed. Found them quite poor. Large family of children. Live in dugout. Mrs. Lichty quite unwell, which added to the distressful appearance of things. Talked to the woman and children about Jesus and heaven. Read, prayed, and sang with them. Distributed fifty cents among the children.</p>

<p><b>13.</b> Studied for Ministerial Association.</p>

<p><b>14.</b> Ministerial Association began. Went early to town. Glad to meet&#8230;&#8203;, but was very much disappointed to learn that&#8230;&#8203;could not be with us.</p>

<p><b>15.</b> I discoursed on the polity of the Church of God in lieu of Brother Howard.</p>

<p><b>16.</b> Sabbath. This is Pentecost day. Thank God for the beautiful weather. All nature seems to be waking from its long winter slumber to praise God. The beautiful prairie is green with grain and pastures. The valleys are dotted with herds of cattle, which, as well as they on a thousand hills, are the Lord&#8217;s. The beautiful streams are lined with plum bushes all in bloom. The groves are preparing to cheer the heart of the prairie inhabitants with their pleasant shady foliage.</p>

<p>At eleven Brother Aller preached in the Methodist Episcopal house and I preached the Pentecostal sermon in the Presbyterian house. <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+2%3A1-4">Acts 2:1-4</a>. At 3 P.M. Brother Aller preached a glorious and lovely sermon on the brotherhood of the saints. Deep and lasting impressions were made. How powerfully this dear brother preached for the unity of the saints of God, with the eloquence of tears and overflowing love! We parted with brotherly greetings at a quite late hour to meet at Crete second Tuesday in September.</p>

<p><b>17.</b> Went to Brother Green&#8217;s. While there Brother S&#8212;&#8212; came in. We were just ready to engage in prayer. The Lord wonderfully blessed me in prayer. I prayed fervently for him, though he has been acting the part of an open enemy to me and the cause I represent. Went to Seward. Received fifty dollars from the Board. Called on Brother J. W. Figard, who is applying himself vigorously to the pursuit of an education. Hope the Lord will raise him up for an effectual minister of the gospel.</p>

<p><b>21.</b> Made out report to the General Eldership.</p>

<p><b>23.</b> Sabbath. This was a glorious and happy day&#8217;s work in the vineyard of the Lord. The Master was very near me all day. Oh, what liberty in speaking! what peace in my soul!</p>

<p><b>26.</b> Up at daylight. Brothers Figard and Anderson moved our things to homestead. We arrived about 1 P.M., they in the eve. Unloaded, took supper, and staid all night in our house.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Here the record of Brother Warner&#8217;s labors in the Western field must end abruptly, as the succeeding portion was in a separate book that has not been found. We leave him with his little family just moved into their own house in Polk County, having spent the winter near Seward. Our next of the diary accounts begins in the following December and finds him back in Ohio fields, whither, probably by decision of the Board of Missions or Eldership he was called to labor again. The daily accounts which have been omitted for want of space show him always active&#8212;traveling, preaching, visiting, praying, etc. The selections that are given from his diary are chosen in order to display the various sides and aspects of his life and character. We have noticed his great zeal for the work of preaching the gospel and caring for those under his charge. The widely separated flocks meant much traveling and exposure in that new country.<a class="notefrom" id="from2" href="#to2">2</a></p>
<div class="note" id="to2"><p class="notenum noindent first">[2]:</p><p><span class="hidden">[</span>Dr. Forney says that in June 1875, Brother Warner organized a church in York County of thirty-one members, and further says of his work in Nebraska that &#8220;to such an extent were the ministers and churches encouraged that they conferred together on the advisability of organizing an Eldership in Nebraska.&#8221; Brother Warner notes in his diary account for November 7, 1874, that a Preliminary Eldership was organized at Crete, in Saline County. Application was made to the General Eldership, which assembled in Ohio in May 1875, and an Eldership bf the Church of God in Nebraska was chartered. The first meeting of the Nebraska Eldership was held at Cropsey. October 1, 1875. Among the fifteen names enrolled Brother Warner&#8217;s does not appear, hence we conclude that by that time he had left Nebraska.<span class="hidden">]</span></p></div>

<p>We note his attitude and teaching on the church question. In a large measure he had light on the true Bible church, and he supposed he was not a member of any sect when, as a matter of fact, he was. The benefits of his knowledge and teachings of the one church were directed in the interest of the so-called church of God, which he was ignorantly laboring to build up. It was not until he received the experience of perfect holiness and began to teach the truth on the subject that he was made to feel his limitations to human ecclesiasticism and thus discover the pen he was in.<a class="notefrom" id="from3" href="#to3">3</a> His teachings and applications of the Scriptural church (there is but one) was possible only among the followers of John Winebrenner or in some similar body supposing themselves to be that one true church. It is an interesting fact that upon the fullness of time for God&#8217;s people to throw off all human ecclesiastical bondage and sever themselves from spiritual Babylon, the lead was taken principally by those who had belonged to the Winebrennerian following. Thus this denominational body may be regarded as a sort of preparatory medium, or halfway step, for the reformation, which is now an established thing. At any rate God had in Brother Warner raised up a man particularly disposed to emphasize the church question, and the denomination mentioned seemed to be the only one he could affiliate with till more advanced light and truth forbade his remaining longer with them.</p>
<div class="note" id="to3"><p class="notenum noindent first">[3]:</p><p><span class="hidden">[</span>That his disposition to be freely led of God made him poor material for a human ecclesiastical machine is evinced in the account by Dr. Forney of the Eighteenth West Ohio Eldership, for the year ending September 30, 1874. He says: &#8220;The beginning of trouble between D. S. Warner and the Eldership is foreshadowed in an action on the adoption of his report, which stated that he had &#8216;organized a church in Upper Sandusky contrary to the Rules of Cooperation&#8217; and regarding this as a &#8216;schismatic movement,&#8217; highly disapproved of his course in organizing said church.&#8221;<span class="hidden">]</span></p></div>
