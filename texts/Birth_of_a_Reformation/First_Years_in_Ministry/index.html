<h1>First Years in Ministry</h1>

<p>Brother Warner had the right view of ministerial qualification. He realized that in order to succeed he must have the spiritual anointing, and that since it was God&#8217;s work it was needful that he be in that divine relation by which it would be God in him accomplishing the result. He held education to be very useful and it was his endeavor throughout his life to add to his knowledge; but he regarded the spiritual qualification as paramount. He soon proved to be gifted as an evangelist and engaged much in evangelistic work.</p>

<p>Before proceeding far in active ministerial work he was married, on the 5th of September 1867, to Tamzen Ann Kerr.<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../texts/Birth_of_a_Reformation/D_S_Warner_and_First_Wife_Tamzen/index.html">*</a> It is probable that he became acquainted with this young woman while he was teaching school in the vicinity of her home, which was near West Unity, Williams County. She lived to enjoy his companionship and to share his labors only about four and one half years. Early in 1872 she gave birth to triplets, which lived only a few hours. Nor did the mother long survive the ordeal, as she died on May 26, after a succession of spasms. A family record in an old Bible shows also the birth of a son, on December 29, 1868, but fails to record his death. Brother Warner refers to this son once in his diary.<a class="lib_ref" name="30. This" href="../../../texts/Birth_of_a_Reformation/A_Nebraska_Mission/?anchor=30. This#30.%20This">*</a></p>

<p>He was granted a license by the West Ohio Eldership,<a class="notefrom" id="from1" href="#to1">1</a> which met in its eleventh annual session at Findlay in October 1867. His reference to this event in his diary is given in another part of this book. In this chapter as well as in some of the succeeding chapters, the copious extracts from Brother Warner&#8217;s diary will give the reader a better understanding of his character, his temperament, his spirituality and devotion, and his work, than would description by another. Unfortunately these journal records for the first five years of his ministry (for it is assumed that he kept such records), which no doubt would be very interesting, are not available. All the information to be obtained covering this period is from those still living who had personal knowledge of the events, and from references to this period in his later records. In one of these he says he began traveling in 1868.<a class="lib_ref" name="10. Sabbath" href="../../../texts/Birth_of_a_Reformation/First_Years_in_Ministry/?anchor=10. Sabbath#10.%20Sabbath">*</a> In another he refers to having labored the first year in Hancock County, at Blanchard Bethel, in connection with Findlay.</p>
<div class="note" id="to1"><p class="notenum noindent first">[1]:</p><p><span class="hidden">[</span>Dr. Forney, in the account of the Eleventh West Ohio Eldership in his <i>History of the Churches of God</i>, refers to D. S. Warner as being &#8220;later the leader in Ohio and westward of a body of people who gave the brotherhood considerable trouble.&#8221;<span class="hidden">]</span></p></div>

<p>During the first six years of his ministry his activities covered practically all of northwestern Ohio and a small portion of Indiana. Persons now living who were present in some of his revivals during this period state that they were remarkable for manifestations of God&#8217;s power. Hard-hearted sinners, some of whom had not attended a meeting for years, would get under conviction and cry audibly for mercy. He ranked high as an evangelist&#8212;above the average of his day. In physical appearance he was slightly above average in height, rather slender and frail in build. His temperament was sanguine&#8212;nervous, eyes blue, hair brown&#8212;a fine, sensitive organization. He wore a full beard, which in later years he kept shortly trimmed. He had the perfect bearing of a minister of the gospel, and his speech and conduct were fully consistent. His mentality was keen. His lungs were weak, but he wore well as a speaker. His voice was musical and possessed good carrying quality. One of his earliest revivals was held at New Washington, Crawford County, the home of his boyhood. He refers to it under the date of November 24, 1872, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">This town had ever been abandoned to the mercies of Catholics, Old Lutherans, and saloons, all of which were equally destructive of all moral good. No protracted effort had ever been made in the place. No conversions had ever been heard of. In the fall of 1870 I was put upon the Seneca circuit, of which New Washington was nearly in the center, and knowing the debauchery and ignorance of the people in general, I determined to lift up the standard of King Immanuel in that place. Accordingly I settled in the place and rented a vacant building that used to contain a drug store and saloon. The owner had speculative motives, having asked quite a dear rent for the room. But during the winter I and companion made special prayer to God for his conversion.</p>

<p>The meeting was begun on the 17th of February 1871. The night before, the owner slept not for deep conviction. As soon as I arose in the morning he came to me in tears and confessed his sins and asked my prayers. I directed him to look to Christ for immediate pardon and deliverance. I gave him some of the great promises of Christ. And there, standing in his own stable, he looked to Christ and experienced a full pardon of all his sins. This settled the rent for the house. The third night six came to the altar. The meeting was attended with great power and produced a great stir among the people, many of whom had never seen the like. Fifty-six were converted, forty-six baptized, and forty-six fellowshipped into the organization.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Among these converts were a number of his schoolmates, old acquaintances, and neighbors. George Pratt, of Nappanee, Indiana, an old schoolmate and a former resident of New Washington, makes this statement concerning this meeting: &#8220;The meeting was held in my father&#8217;s drug-store building. Brother Warner held the meeting unaided. He stood there alone and preached while others threatened. There were bad elements that rose in opposition, the Lutheran being the worst and the Catholic next. My father protected him. It was a wonderful meeting and many were saved.&#8221;</p>

<p>The earliest of his diary records so far available begin in November 1872, as follows, when he was on the Seneca circuit and had his home with a Brother Wright, in Crawford County, Ohio:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first"><b>8.</b> Brother P. Wright brought me to Bucyrus. Staid all night with Bro. J. G. Wirt. The Methodists had a festival. I and a few members of the same church (who repudiated these follies and inconsistencies) met for prayer and the Lord was with us. These brethren were much dissatisfied with their church relation.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> Left Bucyrus at 7 A.M. Reached Lima at nine. Stopped at the Burnet House till 1:20 P.M. Wrote a letter to my brother and one to brother-in-law, L. W. Guiss.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> Sabbath. A.M., prayer meeting at Brother Dague&#8217;s, P.M., heard a Lutheran minister in Milton. Evening, preached from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+28%3A16-17">Isaiah 28:16-17</a>. I occupied the Presbyterian house. I preached here some in the schoolhouse in 1868, the first year I traveled.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> Took the train at 7:30 A.M. for Tontogany, with the design of finding where God wishes me to labor as a missionary. O Lord, guide thy servant to the place thou canst best use him! Walked from Tontogany to Brother Hardee&#8217;s. Evening, went to Evangelical meeting. Brother W&#8212;&#8212; preached. Heard a great noise, but to the congregation it appeared as a tinkling cymbal and sounding brass, evidently having no effect. Nearly all blew loudly the horn of sanctification but manifested little of its fruits, such as travail of soul for the sinner and sympathy for the one soul at the altar, to whom none gave a word of encouragement, but each in turn arose and boasted of his holiness. Oh, the delusions of Satan! How manifold they are!</p>

</blockquote>


<p>In the entry just quoted the reader will notice his prejudice, existing at that time, against the doctrine of holiness, or sanctification. How strange it seems to those who knew him afterward to be a whole-souled advocate of the doctrine of holiness that he should thus speak! It was altogether a matter of light and understanding. His heart was consecrated and he certainly was not unacquainted with the Holy Spirit during his early ministry. But as a definite experience to be believed for and testified to, he knew nothing about sanctification as yet. Also, it is possible that in its advocates whom he had met thus far, the doctrine and experience had not been rightly represented.</p>

<p>It will be observed also from these quotations from his journal that he meant to stand, and believed he was standing, free from sectarianism. He had considerable light on the church question and spiritual Babylon. The place referred to in the following entry was near Holland, Lucas County.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first"><b>13.</b> Visited Father and Brother John McNut and Brother Irvin. Eve, preached in the brick schoolhouse, on <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+1%3A27">James 1:27</a>. Here the Church of God had long been slandered and persecuted, principally by the United Brethren Church. One of the epithets they had for years called us is &#8220;Johnny Cake Church.&#8221; Brother Henry S. McNut lives here nearly alone. He and his wife and their ancestors for generations past belonged to the United Brethren, but in the fall of 1870, after a hard spell of sickness in which he feared that he should die and be lost for not obeying the truth, he came to the West Ohio Eldership and received a license and began to preach amidst a storm of persecution from the United Brethren Church. Even his own companion, though an amiable woman, had been so poisoned against the Church of God that she joined in to oppose him. But he was firm and now commands the position. Every foe had fled and all that truly fear God join in to encourage the truth. Some will doubtless soon cut loose from sectarian bondage. Those that were the bitterest enemies now confess that we are right and they are wrong.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The Church of God, as we have seen, repudiated sectarianism, and the assumption by that church that it was the Scriptural one was a strong underlying principle. In some respects it held the correct idea of the Scriptural church. To some extent, therefore, Brother Warner&#8217;s membership in that denomination afforded him light that naturally led to the full Scriptural standard, which he afterward taught. His affiliation with that denomination in the first place was, as we have seen, because of a disposition to be Scripturally right on this point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first"><b>14.</b> Brother McNut and I went to Toledo to look for a place in which to open a mission in that city.</p>

<p><b>15.</b> Walked nearly all day in search of a place to open a mission. No success. May God soon open the way for the establishment of his church in this place.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>In his diary Brother Warner recorded something for each day. Every time he preached it was noted and numbered and the text was given. The Eldership required each minister to give a report of his work. It is not necessary to quote all the shorter entries and items from his diary, which are much the same and generally speak of his visiting someone, making some trip, reading, writing, preaching, praying, fasting, baptizing, etc. Only the more interesting items, or such as are the most representative, will be given.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first"><b>22.</b> Returned to Auburn. Meeting at Basswood still in progress. The young men who made a start the last night I was there have all found Jesus their Savior. Preached from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Malachi+3%3A8">Malachi 3:8</a>. A deep seriousness pervaded the minds of all. The feeling of that night shall not soon be forgotten. It was as solemn as the grave. A sensation of dark and fearful forebodings of some approaching calamity ran through every mind. Brother H. Caldwell arose and said he had a matter revealed to him that he felt impressed to relate, and that was that before tomorrow&#8217;s sun should set some one in this community would suddenly be killed. At his request we arose and pledged ourselves to offer one more fervent prayer that night in behalf of poor sinners.</p>

<p><b>23.</b> Spent the day at home in reading, meditation and prayer. Brother Jenner preached in the evening. I labored hard to bring penitents to the altar. Three came out, two of whom were old acquaintances of mine, for whom I had felt a deep interest. One found peace.</p>

<p>After meeting was dismissed we heard that Ezekiel R&#8212;&#8212;, an old man eighty-two or eighty-three years of age, who lived one mile and a quarter east of the schoolhouse, had that day been killed by the cars in crossing the track at Shelby. I knew the man from my boyhood; he bought out my father in that country in 1853. He was very wealthy. God had blessed him with long life, prosperity, and good health. But he had no thanks to offer to his divine Benefactor, having set his whole heart upon the god of this world. There was no place for Christ in his heart. He leaned toward Universalism, because congenial to the carnal mind. He was filled with skepticism and was always in the habit of speaking lightly of preachers and professors of religion. I visited him twice during the meeting at Auburn last winter and conversed with him on the subject of religion. He acknowledged that there is one thing in the Bible that caused him to study a good deal, and that is the new birth, which he said, was perfectly dark to him. He told of having once gone to hear one of the greatest champions of Universalism preach on the subject. &#8220;But,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I received no light whatever.&#8221; His case was a clear fulfillment of <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+2%3A11%2C">I&nbsp;John 2:11,</a> <span class="scripture">&#8220;Darkness hath blinded his eyes,&#8221;</span> and <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+4%3A4">II&nbsp;Corinthians 4:4</a>, <span class="scripture">&#8220;The God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not.&#8221;</span> He had a very large development of brain, of which firmness was the largest developed organ. What a pity that the devil perverted these faculties!</p>

<p>I was informed that he was going that day to close a mortgage and take a widow&#8217;s farm from her. His last words to his wife, who cautioned him to beware of the cars at the crossing, were, &#8220;I was not made to be killed by the cars.&#8221; This is like one who said to his soul, <span class="scripture">&#8220;thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+12%3A19" title="Luke 12:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 12:19)</span></a></span> But God said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+12%3A20" title="Luke 12:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 12:20)</span></a></span> He said, &#8220;I was not made to be killed by the cars.&#8221; But God said, &#8220;Thou fool! This day shalt thou be killed by the cars.&#8221; His brains were dashed out and strewn along the road. His body was much mangled. But his poor soul has gone with all its guilt to where another rich man opened his eyes in torment.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The entry for the 24th, which was Sunday, records his preaching a farewell sermon to the congregation at New Washington, and also his reference to the revival held there in February 1871. He had had the care of the congregation there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first"><b>25.</b> I and Brother S. Kline came to Conlay&#8217;s, near Annapolis, Crawford County, Ohio, and began my first protracted effort in the name of Christ. Preached from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+85%3A6-7">Psalm 85:6-7</a>. A good interest was manifested. Oh that God would visit the place in power, save many precious souls, and raise up a people for his name!</p>

<p><b>27.</b> Started early for Bucyrus on our way to the Standing Committee at Rock Run. Took train at 10 A.M., arrived there at noon. I was chosen to fill a vacancy on the committee. Upon us devolved the solemn and responsible duty of trying and disfellowshipping Elder L. E&#8212;&#8212; for immoral conduct. Oh, what a pity! May the Lord have mercy upon him and help him to repent and be restored to the confidence of the people. May he be saved in the day of wrath. Oh, how careful the man of God, especially the minister of the gospel, should conduct himself in this wicked world! Lord, deliver us from temptation.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The meetings referred to in the next few entries were a protracted effort at the Conlay Bethel, near Annapolis, now called Sulphur Springs, Crawford County, Ohio.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first"><b>December 4, 1872.</b> Visited a sick saint, J. McEntire, who has been afflicted for many years. He was near his last. Oh, what a happy soul. The night before he was almost gone. Said he, &#8220;I saw a convoy of angels around my bed waiting to carry my spirit home. I thought I was going home. Here I am yet lingering on the shores of time.&#8221; Then a brother came in, to whom he remarked, &#8220;Sister Polly has gone home. I thought I would beat her, but I am left behind. All summer I and Cousin Patrick and Aunt Polly have had a hard race, but they have both crossed over and I am left to struggle on; but every gale wafts my little ship nearer the shining shore.&#8221; &#8220;Oh!&#8221; said he, &#8220;It is all bright ahead, not a cloud do I see.&#8221; After a little rest he remarked, &#8220;Oh! Brother, I know that my spirit will not go down into forgetfulness until the resurrection; but I am going to Jesus, which is far better. Oh, how sweet the name of Jesus!&#8221; I spent the day with this brother, sang and prayed with him. Eve, preached from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+3%3A19">Acts 3:19</a>.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> Spent the day in fasting and in much wrestling and prayer for poor souls under the guilt of sin. Preached from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+13%3A6-9">Luke 13:6-9</a>. One young lady came to the altar.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> Under much discouragement during the day. Evening while singing the opening hymn I was greatly refreshed at the coming in of Bro. William Burchard, from Auburn, who was converted under my labors and baptized by me last winter. He was a very wild, wicked man, but has become a model of piety and earnest devotion. He has a brilliant intellect and has already made great proficiency in preaching. Thank God for such men of holy zeal. He being tired with the walk of eleven miles, I preached, from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+33%3A11">Ezekiel 33:11</a>. The penitent of the previous night came out and soon the good news went to heaven that another soul was saved by grace. It was a glorious meeting. One sister shouted. I got a great victory and was very happy. Likewise testified the convert and all the rest who spoke.</p>

<p><b>17.</b> Good day meeting. Rebuked a boy for trying to pollute the house of God by spitting tobacco juice and quids on the floor. I said nothing to him, knowing that I should be insulted in return. But being filled with the Spirit I tried to encourage the three little mourners (girls who had come to the altar) and then addressed the brethren upon the importance of laboring for the early conversion of children, stating that it is enough to make the angels in heaven weep to see how the devil is leading even the children to wallow in sin and <span class="scripture">&#8220;glory&#8230;&#8203;in their shame.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+3%3A19" title="Philippians 3:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 3:19)</span></a></span> &#8220;Now, look at that poor boy,&#8221; said I, pointing to him. &#8220;Ever since he came in here he has been doing his best to defile the house of God with his filthy tobacco. It was once said that <span class="scripture">&#8216;every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved,&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+3%3A20" title="John 3:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 3:20)</span></a></span> but the devil has so polluted poor souls that even children in broad daylight do not blush to do such evil and dirty work for the devil as that. Christ said, <span class="scripture">&#8216;that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+15%3A11" title="Matthew 15:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 15:11)</span></a></span> How defiled that heart must be, all that stench having come out of his mouth! A few nights ago a dog was accidentally shut in here and remained until the next evening, but did not pollute the house one half as much as that boy has done in half an hour.&#8221; At this he grabbed his hat and, <span class="scripture">&#8220;being convicted by [his] own conscience, went out.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+8%3A9" title="John 8:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 8:9)</span></a></span> God pity that boy and help older people to take a hint.</p>

<p><b>18.</b> A.M., wrote most of the time. P.M., visited Brother McEntire. Found him much cast down and depressed, being overanxious to be absent from the body, in which <span class="scripture">&#8220;tabernacle [we] groan, being burdened.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+5%3A4" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 5:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 5:4)</span></a></span> I told him that he ought to wait patiently till his &#8220;change cometh,&#8221; knowing when he got home once he would have long time to stay there, even through all eternity, and the longer he should be tossed about upon the dark and tempestuous sea of this troublesome life the greater would be his joy when at last he should land in the peaceful harbor of the great city of God. After reading and singing and praying with him, he had great peace and perfect resignation to God.</p>

<p><b>25.</b> Another Christmas is here. O thou Child of Bethlehem, may we this day bring the offering of a grateful heart! May every tongue on earth and all the angels in heaven join together to spread the glory of Jesus&#8217; name! Dear Lord, we thank thee for the unspeakable gift of thy Son to man. Oh, may every heart prepare him room! Dear Savior, draw poor sinners to thee. Show them thy bleeding hands, temples, and side. Oh that the star of hope would this day guide many poor wandering souls to thee!</p>

<p><b>28.</b> Came to the place of meeting. Distance thirteen miles. Schoolhouse was full. Good attention. Went to Solomon B&#8212;&#8212;&#8217;s, an infidel. Talked till twelve at night.</p>

<p><b>29.</b> Sabbath. Talked with Mr. B. until 10:30 A.M. He is a very smart man. Has his excellent memory stored with the writings of almost every wretch that ever dared to attack God and his holy religion. He is one of the best readers I ever met. What a pity that this noble intellect should be so basely employed! His horrid utterances are enough to chill the blood and heart of man and cause the angels of heaven to weep. He claims to be &#8220;a smarter man than Christ.&#8221; &#8220;The devil is a gentleman compared with God.&#8221; &#8220;Your God is not fit to be worshiped by a dog.&#8221; &#8220;All professors are either hypocrites or fools.&#8221; Oh, that God would pity that poor wretch who in the blindness of his depraved heart dares to rush with violence upon the Almighty!</p>

<p><b>30.</b> Spent the day in reading, writing, and prayer, at Brother Conlay&#8217;s. Eve, preached from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+2%3A4">Romans 2:4</a>. Good congregation. Saw some omens of good.</p>

<p><b>31.</b> This is the last day of another year. How swift the years roll around and each brings us nearer eternity! Lord, help us to redeem the time and so <span class="scripture">&#8220;number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+90%3A12" title="Psalm 90:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 90:12)</span></a></span> that at last it may not be said of us that <span class="scripture">&#8220;we spend our years as a tale that is told.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+90%3A9" title="Psalm 90:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 90:9)</span></a></span> Oh that each hour of my short life may bring some good account at last, when life&#8217;s conflict is o&#8217;er! Great and many have been the changes of the last year. Yea,</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;What countless millions of mankind
<br />Have left this fleeting world!
<br />They&#8217;re gone, but where? Oh, pause and see&#8212;
<br />Gone to a long eternity!&#8221;</p>

<p>One there was, the dearest of my earthly friends, who a year ago stood by my side, the joy of my life, the sweet, innocent object of my fervent love. But she is gone, that dear companion upon whose rosy cheek and harmless lips I used to impress the kiss of burning, never dying love. O Tamzen! Thy heart and life, as pure as the white and fleecy snow that this morning covers thy peaceful resting-place, has reared an everlasting monument in the hearts of all that knew thee on earth.</p>

<p>I have now seen thirty years pass into eternity. Not quite eight years have been devoted to God. The year has been one of God&#8217;s goodness to me, notwithstanding the loss of my blessed wife, which is her gain and God&#8217;s glory, and therefore I am willing to travel on a lone pilgrim in search of souls for Jesus&#8217; sake</p>

<p>&#8217;Twas very stormy. Wrote and read. Preached from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+90%3A9">Psalm 90:9</a>, <span class="scripture">&#8220;We spend our years as a tale that is told.&#8221;</span> Tried to show the folly of living in sin.</p>

<p><b>January 1, 1873.</b> This is the first day of the year. O my soul, set out afresh for heaven! Lord help me to spend the year all to thy glory if we live to the end. But if it is said of me, <span class="scripture">&#8220;This year thou shalt die,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+28%3A16" title="Jeremiah 28:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jeremiah 28:16)</span></a></span> may I be ready to enter into rest.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> Preached from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+6%3A1">Romans 6:1</a>. Told my dream, the subject of which I thought was in the way of a score of souls.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> Fasted today. Very solemn meeting at Brother Crim&#8217;s. All wept for poor sinners. O Lord, hear the prayers and groans and bottle up the tears of thy children and bring thy salvation nigh! Preached from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+2%3A3">Hebrews 2:3</a>. The meeting has received a great backset. I fear the whole work is killed. Before I came here I had a peculiar dream in which I saw a face that was strange to me. There was much confusion in those features, as in the midst of a council it stood out conspicuous, and there was something in the position of the person that pierced my heart. Last night I announced that I had recognized these features since I came here. Mr. B., the infidel, arose and asked whether he were the man. I said no. Tonight Esq. K., a poor blind Lutheran, came to meeting, and before I closed he arose and enquired if he were the man. While I was talking, I was powerfully baptized by the Spirit of God and replied, &#8220;Thou art the man.&#8221; He was daunted, but stammered out a denial; but before I had time to ask a question he confessed that he had forbidden his family to come out to the altar. They&#8217;re five young men and one daughter, three of them were under deep conviction and others serious. One of the boys is married and his wife and all their associates were serious and some anxious to come out, but all were prevented from coming to Christ by this poor wretch, whose form of religion fitted him to do this work for the devil.</p>

<p>In this attack I realized the fulfillment of the promise of Christ: <span class="scripture">&#8220;It shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+10%3A19-20" title="Matthew 10:19-20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 10:19-20)</span></a></span> I warned him of the fearful account he would have to give at the judgment-bar of God.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> Meeting at Samuel Shell&#8217;s. We were all cast down and felt the Spirit of God had been grieved out of the community. Eve, preached from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+28%3A16">Jeremiah 28:16</a>. Gave a farewell address and closed the meeting because, first, the work was so stagnated that nothing could be expected to be accomplished without a longer effort than I could devote to the place and, second, because it was highly probable that as soon as the work should break out again Satan would stir up trouble again from some source. I gained many warm friends and sowed seed which I trust will bring fruit to God. Some of the young men that desired religion I think will not give up the struggle. They sent me some money and word that if I would hold a meeting somewhere in reach that they would attend and seek religion, but there they had not the heart to come out.</p>

<p><b>25.</b> Visited Brother and Sister Chapman. She is an excellent saint. Found her much afflicted. Brother C. had for many years been a skeptic and Universalist, but a year ago he came out at a meeting held by Bro. T. James and me. He is a faithful brother. A neighbor of his by name of L&#8212;&#8212;, who was the means of breaking up the fore-mentioned meeting, dropped dead in his tracks a few months ago.</p>

<p><b>February 28, 1873.</b> Good day meeting at Brother McClintock&#8217;s [near Larue, Marion County]. Eve, preached from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+2%3A2">Ephesians 2:2</a>. Four came to the altar and were blessed, one of whom had been an avowed Universalist. Others doubtless would have come out but the house was so densely filled that we could not crowd the people back to get more room for penitents.</p>

<p><b>March 1, 1873.</b> Spent the day at Mother Melvin&#8217;s. Wrote an article for the <i>Advocate</i>. Brother Burchard preached. Four at the altar. All were blessed, I think. House crowded and many outside.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> Sabbath. Speaking at ten. Preached on Church of God, <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+20%3A28">Acts 20:28</a>. Eve, the house was packed and all the windows were crowded on the outside. Preached, <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+13%3A16">Jeremiah 13:16</a>. By hard work we got a little space at the altar and four presented themselves for prayer.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> Meeting at Brother Deen&#8217;s. Fellowshipped twelve. P.M., because of the immense crowd that thronged the schoolhouse we divided the meeting. I preached at Windfall, from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Job+22%3A15-17">Job 22:15-17</a>. Several rose for prayers. Brother Burchard preached at the Ellen Schoolhouse, one and one half miles north.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> Sabbath. Brother Small and I went to the Shertzer Schoolhouse, where he preached at 1l A.M. on church matters, after which we received in fellowship eleven members, most by letter from the Methodist Episcopal and Presbyterian Churches. After taking a hasty dinner we mounted our steeds and rode four miles, partly through a woods, in the midst of a rain and severe storm. Reached Windfall at 2:30 P.M. Eve, preached on <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+26%3A18">Acts 26:18</a>. One at the altar.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> Prepared a dam to baptize. Eve, <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Numbers+10%3A28">Numbers 10:28</a>.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> A.M., preached on sisters&#8217; right to speak and pray in meeting, after which we had a speaking-meeting. Fellowshipped fourteen members. House crowded and many on the outside. One brother who was always opposed to women&#8217;s speaking arose and confessed his error. We then proceeded to the water, where I baptized twenty-two converts in eleven minutes. It was a glorious and beautiful baptismal service. All came out shouting and praising God. Eve, preached on <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+13%3A6-9">Luke 13:6-9</a>. Several rose for prayers, some of whom were old in sin. We had a speaking-meeting. All that had been immersed said that it had been a happy day for them and that they had turned a new and brighter page in the history of their pilgrimage. Oh, how good it is to obey God! A good part of the number had been sprinkled, some after making a profession of religion in adult years. Great God, what a pity that the world is cursed by an unholy sectarian ministry who <span class="scripture">&#8220;[teach] for doctrines the commandments of men&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+15%3A9%3B+Mark+7%3A7" title="Matthew 15:9; Mark 7:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 15:9; Mark 7:7)</span></a></span>!</p>

<p><b>12.</b> Eve, preached on barren fig tree, <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+21%3A18-22">Matthew 21:18-22</a>. Four came to the altar, one blessed. Went home with Mr. William Riser, who brought a horse for me to ride. It was a beautiful light night, and a ride of some two miles winding through the woods was somewhat pleasant. Did not retire until twelve o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p><b>13.</b> This morning I spent an hour rambling far out in the dense, rolling forest to breath the pure air and to hold communion with my God. At ten William Riser&#8217;s house was filled with brethren and sisters. We had a glorious meeting. All were happy, many shouted. It was something very strange to have a meeting in this house. All remarked that it was something they had never expected to see. Mr. R. is a man of nearly fifty years and a great sinner. His wife has been converted and I think the Lord is striving with his heart and his brother&#8217;s, who is still older. Oh, that God would raise them up as monuments of his mercy! Eve, <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+19%3A10">Luke 19:10</a>. Two at the altar.</p>

<p><b>14.</b> A.M., meeting at schoolhouse. P.M., just before preaching I met with a few brethren who had been at variance, and helped to form a reconciliation, which was a perfect success. Preached on <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+22%3A21">Matthew 22:21</a>.</p>

<p><b>16.</b> Sabbath. Preached one and three fourths hours on <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+43%3A10-11">Ezekiel 43:10-11</a>, after which we fellowshipped and then baptized three. Eve, Brother Crawford, Baptist minister preached. Closed the meeting. Result, thirty-five converted, twenty-five immersed, church formed of thirty-three members. Expect more additions soon.</p>

<p><b>20.</b> Eve, met the church at Windfall. Decided to build a meetinghouse. Preached on church officers. Elders and deacons elected.</p>

<p><b>April 3, 1873.</b> Came to New Haven [Huron County]. Eve, met a number of my dear spiritual children in prayer meeting. Had a good time and they exhorted me to meet them in heaven.</p>

<p><b>4.</b> Beautiful day. How bright the sun shines! How the heart is gladdened at the return of warm and sunny days after such a long and hard winter as we have passed through! Oh, how I appreciate the Savior&#8217;s beautiful metaphor in the Song of Solomon, where the present state of the church is represented by the winter with its dark clouds and howling winds, fierce with cold and hunger and hardship! But glory to God, the spring will come; already the fig-tree is putting forth her leaves, the turtle dove is heard in the land, and soon we shall hear the voice of the bridegroom calling, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. For, lo, the winter is past.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Song+2%3A10-11" title="Song 2:10-11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Song 2:10-11)</span></a></span> What a happy time that will be when, rising from the grave, we shall meet our dear friends and our Savior!</p>

<p>I am writing these lines in the beautiful cemetery near New Haven, Ohio. Before me is the little mound which shows the resting-place of my three little infants who a little over a year ago passed in a few hours through this vale of tears, and their little spirits are forever at rest with Jesus; and in one little box their bodies await the Savior&#8217;s coming. What a glorious morning when all these graves shall burst open and the bodies shall come forth! They that have done good to the resurrection of life and glory, and they that have done evil to the resurrection of shame. Oh, may I be among the former class! Lord, make me a good man and keep me pure in heart. Farewell, sacred spot. Farewell, little tomb, with thy three-fold treasure.</p>

<p><b>16.</b> Went to Bryan [Williams County] and ordered a tombstone for my wife&#8217;s grave. The one selected cost fifty dollars, has a Bible lying on it, and I gave the following epitaph:</p>

<p class="verse">How sweet and pure in social life,
<br />As daughter, sister, friend, and wife!
<br />Now done with cares below the sun,
<br />She shines before the snow-white throne.</p>

<p><b>18.</b> Came home. Found Father and Mother and Brother well.</p>

<p><b>23.</b> Commenced an editorial on Islamism.</p>

<p><b>24.</b> Wrote and studied phrenology alternately.</p>

<p><b>26.</b> Sent my article on Islamism. Brother Cassel and other preachers in Illinois send an urgent invitation for me to come to that State.</p>

<p><b>27.</b> Sabbath. Preached today from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+1%3A10">II&nbsp;Peter 1:10</a> in the Cogswell Schoolhouse [near his father&#8217;s home], where I made my first effort to preach the gospel, on Easter night, 1867. &#8217;Twas in a Methodist Episcopal protracted meeting. The text was <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+3%3A18">Acts 3:18</a>. Never preached there since. In those six years I have preached all over northwest Ohio and some in two counties in Indiana, in all 1241 sermons. The number of converts 508, about the same number fellowshipped, some less baptized. Thanks be to God for his blessings and his presence! Though always of weak lungs, thought oft to be consumptive, yet my health has been better since in the ministry than ever before. Bless God for his goodness! I have never missed but one appointment on account of health. The years have swiftly passed, but, thank the Lord, I have enjoyed great peace and many rich blessings from the Lord.</p>

<p><b>May 13, 1873.</b> Visited Tamzen&#8217;s grave. Disappointed in not finding the monument up. Visited D. W. Dustin, one of my scholars. Exhorted him to give his heart to Christ.</p>

<p><b>15.</b> Prepared a sermon on the evidence of the divine origin of the Bible.</p>

<p><b>16.</b> Argument with Mr. Butler on the soul.</p>

<p>He attended, from the 21st to the 23d, the meeting of the Board of Missions. He does not indicate where this meeting was held, but says in connection that he &#8220;preached in the Smithville Bethel&#8221; and &#8220;had very poor liberty, owing perhaps to the presence of many eastern ministers.&#8221; It was at this meeting of the Board of Missions that he received his appointment to the mission in Nebraska, of which he thus speaks:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first"><b>23.</b> Beautiful day. Business finished up at 5 P.M. Brother Small was appointed to Chicago, I to Seward mission, Nebraska. Again I lay all upon the altar of God. It is very hard for me to leave my dearly beloved brethren of West Ohio. Thank God, for the great Head of the church is with them and his cause is greatly prospering here, and I must go help the cause in the far West. We parted with tears and many farewells.</p>

<p><b>24.</b> Brother Small and I took train at 7:14 A.M., he for Marion, I for Larue, which I reached at 12 M. Received a letter from my beloved brother Sol. Kline. All our dear spiritual children are yet doing well on Seneca circuit. Wrote two letters.

<p><b>29.</b> Staid last night with Brother L. Orr. Sister o. is afflicted; prayed to the Lord for her recovery. Preached in Larue, eve, <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+43%3A10-11">Ezekiel 43:10-11</a>.</p>

<p><b>30.</b> It had been announced in the Larue Citizen that I would speak on the Church of God. This brought out quite a large congregation. Both nights I spoke plainly and boldly against the evil of sectarianism and other abominations. Many were ill at ease. Some preachers were present. The Lord gave me good liberty. Last night I diagrammed my subject with chalk upon the blackboard. 2 P.M., took train for Pentecost meeting at Pleasant Hill.</p>

<p>Brother Warner became a strong exponent of the prophecies. Note his reference to some reform near at hand. This meeting was held at West Auburn, Crawford County, after his return from Pleasant Hill.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first"><b>June 8, 1873.</b> Sabbath. Thank God for life and health and this beautiful day! Behold the throngs pressing toward the house of God! Speaking-meeting was to begin at half past nine. Ere the time the house was filled. Others kept coming in continually, much to the detriment of the interest of the meeting. After all were seated that could be and the aisles were filled, there were numbers yet without. The house had been purchased by the Church of God from the Methodist Episcopal Church and repaired in good style. At eleven, preaching began. Text, <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Haggai+2%3A9">Haggai 2:9</a>, <span class="scripture">&#8220;The glory of this latter house shall be greater than the former, saith the Lord of hosts.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>I then took up the text used in the forenoon and showed that the destruction of the Temple and the Babylon captivity typified the dark age. The different attempts to rebuild typified the different reformations. Its final completion, i.e., all the so-called churches arising in and growing out of the Dark Age, including the sects, in which are many of God&#8217;s people, who are, however, commanded of God to <span class="scripture">&#8220;come out of her.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+18%3A4" title="Revelation 18:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 18:4)</span></a></span> Further showed that according to the type and other Scriptures the church of God must arise to a glory excelling that of the first age, and that, owing to the fact that the world is near its end (of which we gave some Scripture evidence), some great revolution must be near at hand to bring about this prophesied glory of the church.</p>

<p>Some remarks were made on the ordinances, after which we engaged in the ordinances. Had a glorious time. A great many brethren and sisters were present to engage in following the Lord. Oh, how I love those dear people! What a host of true hearts! God bless them.</p>

<p><b>14.</b> Traveled by buggy to the grove meeting at Windfall, four miles south of Larue. Brother Burchard preached an excellent sermon.</p>

<p><b>17.</b> Received letters from Brother Bolton requesting me to come soon to my mission [in Nebraska] and one from Brother Shoemaker requesting me to stop and preach over Sabbath in Chicago.</p>

<p><b>19.</b> Wrote out the record of the Church of God at New Washington. Eve, preached at Union. Here the church have a peculiar attachment to me. All wept much at my departure. A more true and faithful band is hard to find. God bless them. They are very dear to me. About half of the church are my converts.</p>

<p><b>20.</b> Visited Brother E&#8212;&#8212; and Sister P&#8212;&#8212;. They embraced religion under my labors, and I joined them in marriage. Came home and packed for my journey.</p>

<p><b>21.</b> Finished matters up to start. Received a letter from a <i>kind friend</i>. Went to New Haven in the evening. Farewell meeting at New Haven.</p>

<p><b>22.</b> Sabbath. Thank God for a beautiful day. Many brethren came in from Union, New Washington, Auburn, and Liberty, and Brother Mitchell and others from east Ohio. We had a glorious meeting. I preached on <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+13%3A29">Luke 13:29</a>, <span class="scripture">&#8220;They shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>After preaching. Brother Jenner baptized four souls, two of whom had been converted here at New Haven, the other two were from elsewhere. Thus out of eight souls converted only two were baptized. This is the result of deferring to baptize for six months. Evening, preached on <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+6%3A66-68">John 6:66-68</a>. Had a good time in observing the ordinances. With many tears and farewell greetings, we gave each other the parting hand. Oh, what friends are these! It tries the heartstrings to leave them. What a glorious thing that there is a meeting that knows no parting! What must it be to be there! May we all meet at last when the storms of life are over.</p>

<p>Before leaving for the West, a correspondence was arranged with Sarah A. Keller, of Upper Sandusky. She is doubtless the &#8220;kind friend&#8221; just referred to with emphasis. Out of this correspondence there soon sprang a glowing flame of love, the beginning of a companionship that meant for him so much of both weal and woe.</p>
