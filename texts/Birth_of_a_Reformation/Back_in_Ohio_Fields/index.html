<h1>Back in Ohio Fields</h1>

<p>In his resumption of the work in Ohio we find Brother Warner in charge, it seems, of the Ashland circuit, with his home at Hayesville, Ashland County. Here, as was characteristic of him everywhere, he was wholly absorbed in spiritual labor, the salvation of sinners and the general spiritual welfare of people everywhere within his reach. In his diary for December 21, 1875, he says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Went out visiting and talking to the people. My soul was so happy all day that I could hardly refrain from shouting. Oh, how sweet it was to talk to sinners about Jesus and his love! Found in shops and houses a number of precious souls that were serious. I admonished them to repent. Some gave much hope of a start.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The closing moments of the year 1875 were devoted to a renewal of consecration of himself and others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">A few minutes before twelve we all bowed down and to the service of God consecrated ourselves and vowed fidelity. God accepted the offering and sealed our vows to him by the gift of his Spirit. After affectionate New Year greetings and congratulations, we went to our homes to rest.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Into his congregation at Shenandoah an Elder L&#8212;&#8212; had come and was poisoning the minds of the converts by teaching the Campbellite doctrine of baptism as an essential condition to the pardon of sin. He afterward held a public discussion with this preacher.<a class="notefrom" id="from1" href="#to1">1</a></p>
<div class="note" id="to1"><p class="notenum noindent first">[1]:</p><p><span class="hidden">[</span>Brother Warner was one of the principal debaters of the Church of God. Dr. Forney mentions his debates as follows: In August 1871 with the Reverend Mr. Baker, of the Disciple Church, the proposition being, &#8220;The Church of God of which I am a member is the only church of divine origin.&#8221; In June 1872 with Leonard Parker, Methodist Episcopal Church, on the old subject of baptism. On May 15, 1874, near Orton, Nebraska, he defended the perpetuity and public observance of feet washing as an ordinance against E. Evans, of the Disciple Church. At the Osborne Schoolhouse, near Seward, Nebraska, with C. L. Boyd, Adventist. The proposition discussed was, &#8220;The first day of the week has been set apart by divine authority as Sabbath or Lord&#8217;s day.&#8221; The discussion was the outcome of a series of addresses by Boyd on the seventh day Sabbath. So well did Warner defend the proposition, says Forney, that at the close of the debate the congregation present voted thirty-six to sixteen that he had established it. The debate continued three evenings.<span class="hidden">]</span></p></div>

<blockquote>
<p class="first"><b>February 19, 1876.</b> Drove to Shenandoah. Found Elder L&#8212;&#8212; having a good time deluding and baptizing sinners. Found the converts greatly strengthened by the wind of doctrine that had been assailing them. However, a few had been corrupted by the false doctrine and were inclined to go from the Church of God, being carried by the wind of doctrine. With a mean, sneaking look they applied for letters. I told them that I had not taken them into the Church of God and could not dismiss them from it, and there was only one way to get out and that was through sin. This they could not deny, nor could they give a reason for their course.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>About this time he gradually came into the knowledge of the truth respecting divine healing, and we find in his accounts an occasional reference to his praying for the sick and of their recovery.</p>

<p>He was sent for by his father-in-law to come to Upper Sandusky, where sectarians were making inroads among the converts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first"><b>April 2, 1876.</b> The sectarians are making a stampede this morning. They have been after about every convert to go to their church and now this morning they have their conclave outside and every convert is stopped and asked to join the Methodists. An excitement is raised and the people&#8217;s minds are bewildered, and some who had said they would stick to the Church of God are now standing back. Before closing, an old bigot, belonging to the Methodists, took the liberty to get up and call for all to raise their hands who wanted to go to Methodism. Some responded. O Sectarianism! thou abomination of the earth, thou bane of the cause of God, when will thy corrupt and wicked walls fall to earth and cease to curse men to hell?</p>

<p><b>June 4, 1876.</b> This is the second anniversary of our marriage. Thank God for connubial and domestic happiness. May God continue to bless us with love, peace, and sacred union.</p>

<p><b>July 18, 1876.</b> Received the sad and startling news of the death of my dear mother. She died July 13. The days of her pilgrimage were seventy-one years, five months, and seven days. Hers was a life of trouble and care. But, thank God, she has gone to her sweet rest in heaven. Oh, how sacred the memory of thy pure and virtuous life! <span class="scripture">&#8220;Patient in tribulation,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+12%3A12" title="Romans 12:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 12:12)</span></a></span> constant and untiring in thy kindness and care for all under thy roof. Oh, what love like a mother&#8217;s! What mother like my own dear, sainted mother? In all the ordeal of life thy calm and peaceful spirit has never known a ruffle. Thy love has never once failed. Thy sorely tried patience never was exhausted.</p>

<p>Dearest mother, in childhood and youth thou wast my all. And when maturer years had launched my bark in the midst of awful breakers, dark clouds, and tempestuous seas of corrupt society, thy pure life was my only star of hope. Thank God, thou shalt be honored in heaven with the salvation of one poor, wayward son by thy holy influence. Praise the Lord for a good and holy mother!</p>

<p>She was always strongly inclined to piety, the fear and reverence of God. In October 1870, she was fellowshipped by the Church of God at South Bridgewater and the same day immersed by me in the St. Joseph River. Though she was feeble and the weather cold and the distance over three miles from home, she chose to go home before changing clothes. She was a happy soul, and the next day seemed quite improved in health. Now she is gone. One of the dearest ties that bound me to earth now attracts me to heaven. I cannot lament her departure. I only grieve that I was not informed of her affliction that I could have been there to cheer her while approaching the river. Or, had I only been apprized of her death that I could have seen once more the face of my own dear mother before she was laid in the tomb! But I shall see her not again until the heavens are no more and the Son of God shall come to call the saints from the dust of the earth. Farewell, dear mother. We soon shall meet again.</p>

<p><b>July 29, 1876.</b> We visited the penitentiary [in Columbus]. Over 1,300 prisoners. All at work manufacturing nearly everything in use. The extensive work was interesting, but the study of the heads and faces of the workmen was much more so. One striking characteristic was, almost invariably, great firmness. This being perverted enabled them to execute their dark crimes. Conscientiousness was low in every head. This left them without moral restraint. Some I observed were very deficient in the social group, especially was inhabitiveness almost entirely deficient. This gave a rambling disposition, hence irresponsible and exposed to bad society. A large majority exhibited a very good intellect, many even above mediocrity. These intellectual powers, which had they been sanctified to God would have been very useful, being perverted were used only to devise crime.</p>

<p><b>October 1, 1876.</b> Eldership meeting at Findlay. I was much overcome with emotion as I tried to speak of my meeting with the Eldership for the first time in that house nine years ago. Never shall I forget the solemn feelings I experienced at that time. I had not expected a license; but how I trembled with fear and dread when I learned that a license and a field of labor were given me! I thought it all a mistake of the Eldership. I repaired to the stable of Brother F&#8212;&#8212;, where I poured out my heart to God in prayer. Bless God, he heard me and comforted my agonizing heart. I then received the assurance that he was directing my way. My soul was unburdened and my peace flowed like a river. And now my laboring soul and inmost heart would give thanks to God who has upheld me in the arduous labors of the past nine years. Having begun an invalid, supposed by many to be a consumptive, my strength has gradually increased through God&#8217;s blessings and mercies.</p>

<p><b>30.</b> Gathered some chestnuts this morning. Had a season of prayer in the woods.</p>

<p><b>November 30, 1876.</b> This is Thanksgiving Day. Oh, that the whole nation would indeed thank God for his goodness and mercy! Brother Oliver and I each made a short discourse on the occasion. P.M., read O. S. Fowler&#8217;s <i>Physiology, Animal and Mental</i>. O God, forgive me of the sin this book has convicted me of. By the grace of God, from this day forth I will reform in quantity, etc., of food as much as my irregular mode of life will allow. How much I can improve the vigor of the mind and the fervor of devotion! Thank God for this volume! Oh, that every one had it who is suffering for want of its instruction!</p>

<p><b>December 31, 1876.</b> Sabbath. Arose early to go to my appointments. Levilla ill. Mother Keller very sick with headache, unable to be up. Was compelled to stay at home. Oh, what distress of mind I was in this day through the fearful conflict of duty to family and duty to the cause! How wretched I felt all day! The day was pleasant and I know there were crowded houses to hear the gospel. How I longed to preach to them!</p>

<p><b>January 1, 1877.</b> Went to visit Mr. S&#8212;&#8212;, who is suffering awful distress. Was met by a young man who was coming after us. We went with the hope that the poor, dying man was eager to hear of Christ and his salvation; but, oh, horror of horrors! When we approached the house we heard the poor soul hollowing out in wild strains: &#8220;I can&#8217;t die; I can&#8217;t die.&#8221; I asked him if we should pray for him. He hollowed out &#8220;No!&#8221; But I thought he was delirious and concluded to sing and pray with him, which I did with all my heart. After prayer I talked with the family and learned that he had said he was a lost sinner, that he could not be saved. I asked him if we should pray. He shook his head. I talked to him of how Christ died for sinners and how he loved and desired to save him; but there was a hideous look in his eyes. He looked frightful, yet he was conscious, answered every question we could ask him. I called for oil and said I would do as the New Testament directed. So I bowed down, anointed his forehead, and was about to anoint his breast when he seized his shirt and drew it together. I laid one hand on his head, the other on his body, and began to pray. He drew his head forward and tried to get it under the cover. He shoved my hand from under his head. I could pray but little. He told every one present that he did not want us to come back. He said he would die; was not prepared to die; did not believe that Christ died for him; did not love Christ and did not want to. He showed every appearance of being possessed by the devil. When we kept our distance he would turn and look at us with fiendish vengeance. When we approached he would turn his face to the wall. Poor soul! Soon he will be in eternity, I presume, and yet raging mad against Christ and his people. I shall never forget the horrors of this day. When we entered the first room we met several women weeping. The old mother fainted away. He was crying loudly in the other room.</p>

<p>In 1877, while on the Ashland circuit Brother Warner arranged, in connection with ministerial duties, to take some selective studies at Vermillion College, located at Hayesville. This was a Presbyterian school of some note at the time, enrolling three hundred to four hundred students. It was founded in 1845. Dr. Sanders Diefendorf became its head in 1849. Brother Warner and his wife were invited to occupy rooms in the building, and they did so, as they found they could live much cheaper there than in Mansfield and would enjoy better privileges of study. They engaged five rooms for the summer of 1877, which cost them six dollars a month. Among Brother Warner&#8217;s studies at this place were English Analysis, Greek, German, and studies in the New Testament. He took an active part in the literary society.</p>

<p>The year 1877 was a notable one in Brother Warner&#8217;s life. Already accomplished as he was in deep spirituality and devotion, it would seem that these graces were multiplied or intensified tenfold by an attainment that from this year became his permanent possession. That attainment was the experience of entire sanctification as received definitely by faith and subsequent to regeneration. <i>He embraced the cause of holiness.</i></p>

<p>He had been for some years honestly prejudiced against the doctrine; but he heard some truth by the holiness advocates that set him to thinking. It was doubtless largely through the influence of his father-in-law&#8217;s family that he began to be won to the doctrine. They had become friends of the holiness cause and had received the experience. His wife also was sanctified, and the change in her was a test that he had no words to gainsay. A holiness band had been formed at Upper Sandusky, where his wife&#8217;s people lived.</p>

<p>The one minister who perhaps more than any other led him into the experience of holiness, was C. R. Dunbar, a Baptist who was laboring in connection with the Holiness Alliance. Brother Warner says of him, &#8220;He is a very able man intellectually, but still more potent in faith and gospel, Holy Ghost power.&#8221; He was the musical author of the song, now so common:</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;I&#8217;ll live for him who died for me,
<br />How happy then my life shall be!
<br />I&#8217;ll live for him who died for me,
<br />My Savior and my God.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Ill_Live_for_Him/index.html" title="I'll Live for Him">*</a></p>

<p>The great holiness movement was sweeping over the country at this time. Brother Warner was too loyal to God and to the teaching of the Bible ever to be classed among those who should reject holiness when brought face to face with the issue. He and his wife gave their names to the holiness band at Upper Sandusky, and he quoted the words of the Psalmist: <span class="scripture">&#8220;I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+119%3A63" title="Psalm 119:63"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 119:63)</span></a></span> At this time his impulsiveness led him to claim the blessing at once, but he soon found that it could not be picked up so readily; that for him, as well as for others, there was a consecration to make and self to be crucified.</p>

<p>A little anecdote in this connection is told by a brother who heard Brother Warner relate it of himself. He (Brother Warner) had been attending some meetings of the holiness people and had received some light. On returning to his charge he preached a sermon on holiness without having obtained the experience. Two sisters who had received the experience knew that he did not yet have it and urged that he get it before attempting to preach it. At the altar service that followed he got down as if to pray for others, but first prayed privately for his own sanctification. Then audibly he began, &#8220;Lord, sanctify us,&#8221; whereupon one of the sisters said, &#8220;Brother Warner, do not pray, &#8216;Lord, sanctify <i>us</i>&#8217;; but say, &#8216;Lord, sanctify <i>me</i>.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221; At this he wilted and came right out with &#8220;Lord, sanctify <i>me</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>We shall quote freely from his diary, as his experience at this time is best expressed by his own words.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first"><b>April 13, 1877.</b> Had much talk with Brother Dunbar on sanctification. I have always believed in a full salvation, and agree that it is usually obtained after the justified state. This was my experience as well as that of all advocates of holiness; but I was inclined to attribute the deficiency of the justified state to infantile weakness, which through outward sinful influence, was not able to carry out the pure nature fully in practice. But he and all sanctificationists attribute it to the remaining depravity of nature.</p>

<p><b>16.</b> Since I arose this morning my constant prayer to God has been that he will lead me in all things. I pray God to take me like an old sack and shake me until entirely empty, and then me with the fullness of himself. O God! turn out every nook and corner of my heart and purge me, soul, body, spirit, and mind. I received a blessing about the time I entered the ministry that seemed to correspond with the experience of sanctified ones; but I have not always kept that state of perfect love, and my God knows that I need a fresh blessing of sanctification power&#8230;&#8203;Though I experienced sanctification ten years ago, when entering upon the work of the ministry, yet I want and need a renewal of God&#8217;s power, that my testimony for God may be more effectual. Also, I know that I have not always lived in this glorious liberty. I have this day examined my heart carefully and feel assured that I accept the whole will of God and now stand by faith upon the promise of God. I leave myself and all my concerns in his hands. By faith I say, &#8220;I am the Lord&#8217;s, and he is mine.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Here Brother Warner quotes the poem, &#8220;Farther On.&#8221; How appropriate this was to his life at this point! How much of his activity and accomplishment were enveloped in the &#8220;farther on&#8221;!</p>

<p class="verse">A soft, sweet voice from Eden stealing,
<br />Such as but the angels sing;
<br />Hope&#8217;s cheering song is ever thrilling,
<br />&#8220;It is better farther on.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">I hear Hope singing, sweetly singing
<br />Softly in an undertone,
<br />And singing as if God had taught her,
<br />&#8220;It is better farther on.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">By night and day she sings the same song,
<br />Sings it while I sit alone;
<br />And sings it so the heart may hear it,
<br />&#8220;It is better farther on.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">She sits upon the grave and sings it,

<blockquote>
<p class="first"><b>April 25, 1877.</b> I was dull today. Study was a drag. I prayed to God that if I am pursuing these studies for his glory he should quicken my mind. I was, as oft before, convinced that I ate too much, which stupefied my mind; hence resolved, as oft before, to quit gormandizing to gratify appetite. I resolved in God&#8217;s name and in his strength to do this thing. I ate but a few spoonfuls of graham mush for supper. Felt cheered by God&#8217;s presence in evening worship.</p>

<p><b>26.</b> My mind was active today. Lessons were easily learned, spirits cheerful, recitations more successful. O Lord, keep me in the possession of a clear, active, and retentive mind, a pure heart, and a consecrated life, devoted to God&#8217;s service.</p>

<p><b>May 19, 1877.</b> Had a very interesting meeting in the Excelsior Society. M. J. Boyd and I conducted the main discussion on the following question: Do We Suffer More from Real Than Imaginary Evils? I affirmed.</p>

<p><b>27.</b> Sabbath. Beautiful day. Arose early and, taking a testament with me, I took a long walk, enjoying the precious pure air, the beauties of nature, and communion with God through his Word and Spirit. Read and meditated upon several chapters. Precious season in family worship. Just when we were through with breakfast the boy raised the cry that the house was on fire. We ran to the bedroom and found the curtains and clothing around the wall in a blaze. Great excitement prevailed. But soon by means of a few pails of water and by throwing some of the burning fabrics out, the fire was extinguished with the loss only of some clothing. The fire was started by a small child, who finding a match on the candlestick, struck it and then dropped it on the end of the curtain that reached to the floor.</p>

<p><b>June 1, 1877.</b> Prepared and delivered a lecture before the Excelsior Society on the Interrelation between Mind and Body, and their Mutual Dependence.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> Built steps over the fence to avoid having the gate left open, as much of my cabbage has already been destroyed. As a consideration, Professor agreed to give me more ground to garden.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> Worked on an essay for the Society tonight, also on a composition for the Board, to be criticized. Eve, met with the Excelsior Society and entered upon the duties of secretary. There being few present, all other exercises were dispensed with but a general discussion on the subject, Is Force More Effectual in Government than Persuasion. I took the negative. Mr. W. Diefendorf also spoke on the negative. The vote was almost unanimous for the negative.</p>

<p><b>15.</b> A.M., recitations as usual. P.M., prepared for Society. Rained all afternoon and evening. No Excelsior meeting. Visited the Philo Society. Participated in general discussion on the following question: Is the Fear of Punishment a Greater Incentive to Exertion than the Hope of Reward? Spoke on the negative. Large majority in our favor on the final vote.</p>

<p><b>July 5, 1877.</b> Met at half-past nine in the Bethel. After a profitable season of prayer, reading the Word, testifying, etc., I presented myself at the altar to seek entire sanctification. I enjoyed that blessing ten years ago, but I had all this time repudiated the second work and accounted for the wonderful change that God had wrought in me at that time to my yielding to the call to preach the blessed gospel of Jesus, after being disobedient. I had often been disgusted, too, with the fanaticism I saw mixed with the professors of the second work; it had steeped me with prejudice through and through.</p>

<p>Though I could not deny that the experience of these people was in perfect harmony with my own, yet I strongly opposed their views, claiming that God does not do his work by piecemeal, but that he makes a full and complete finish of it at once. I attributed the second experience to the fact that after conversion we are weak infants and not able to carry into action the pure nature that God has given us until we grow to that degree of strength that we can successfully cope with outer temptation, and that holy nature given to us in regeneration reaches a degree of development in strength that it will no more be under subjection to sin in the world around us.</p>

<p>Thus, while I did not doubt the truthfulness of their testimony, I thought I comprehended the whole matter and saw the slight mistake, as I supposed, in the basis of their experience.</p>

<p>But God having let Father and Mother Keller and the whole family into this glorious experience, with my dear companion, I began to search the Scriptures anew to see if I might not be mistaken myself. I carefully reviewed my conversion and recollected that I sought and asked of God only pardon of my past sins and relief from my past guilt. That in ten years labor, in which some seven hundred souls came to Christ, I never knew one to seek for anything else but pardon for actual transgression and it is a fact that we do not ask of God that which we have not apprehended the need of, and God does not give until we ask of a thing.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is claimed that justification is not a partial but complete work of itself, and sanctification, i.e., purification, another. Since seeing every day the change in my dear wife I thought I was beyond doubt of this second work. But, ah, the devil is rallying his forces against me. Am I making a fool of myself coming out here where I have invited and labored with sinners? My old arguments would come up and I had powerful temptations to settle back upon them and forever repudiate the second work. I obtained no light.</p>

<p>P.M. We met at half-past two and held meeting till nearly five. I labored at the altar. At night after Brother Burlison read a Scripture lesson and talked for some time on holiness, we all bowed around the altar; but I could do nothing, all was dark. I came here fully believing in a second work of God in the soul: but now, as I attempt to seek it, how thick the temptations of Satan come up before me! How all my old arguments and objections gather like rubbish, obstructing the light! Sometimes I was about to conclude that this was all foolishness. I was ashamed to bow at the altar and seek sanctification of &#8220;soul, body, and spirit&#8221; after I had invited sinners to and labored with them at the same altar.</p>

<p><b>6.</b> Arose early this morning and searched the Scriptures and asked God for light. I noticed whenever I felt resigned to God and was willing to make any sacrifice to know the truth I was strongly impressed to seek sanctification.</p>

<p>This morn I was directed to <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+5%3A10">I&nbsp;Peter 5:10</a> and <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+3%3A14-20">Ephesians 3:14-20</a>. Light is becoming brighter in the Word. Thank God. Met at half-past nine. The foundation of faith was now becoming strong in me. I arose and read some portions of the Word and boldly declared my faith in the second work, and that I was resting in the promises of God to my entire sanctification. Met again, at 2:30 p.m., having spent most of the interval in searching my heart, and truly I found that it has not been as good as I before supposed. Oh, how much self there has been in all my past labors! God of power, kill and cast out all of self. I reviewed my observations of the past ten years&#8217; labor. About seven hundred souls I have observed seeking salvation, and I cannot recall any who did not definitely seek for justification from past sins. It appears that the condemned sinner can think of nothing else and does not possess a capacity to grasp the idea that God is able to destroy all evil in depraved humanity. &#8220;God, forgive my past sins and help me in the future to keep from sin,&#8221; is about as great a blessing as the mind beclouded by guilt can conceive and ask for. With a still more deep and fervent consecration I again sought the blessing of perfect holiness. Glory to God, I was able to claim the blessing by faith, though yet without the anointing of power. After meeting I spent most of the time talking holiness to several brethren, which I felt was pleasing to God.</p>

<p>Eve, Brother Burlison read <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+3">I&nbsp;Corinthians 3</a>, and talked a little; then, an invitation being given, a good many surrounded the altar, several of whom were seeking the blessing. Thank God, some professed to receive the blessing. I am still standing, yea, resting sweetly in the promise of God for entire and constant salvation through the blood of Jesus.</p>

<p><b>7.</b> Today we fasted all day. Met in the Bethel at 9 A.M. and held meeting until after 4 P.M. without intermission. This day I was the least conscious of a physical nature and my relations with a corporeal world of any day in all my life. I seemed to be entirely unconscious of passing time. Only the spirit seemed to live, stir, feel, and take cognizance. Glory to the God of wonders! Is this really but the footstool of God?</p>

<p>Mother Keller, Sarah, and I went to Brother L&#8212;&#8212;&#8217;s for supper. She (Mrs. L.) very soon began to pour out her bitter railing against holiness and holy ones; but praise God, he kept our souls in perfect peace. After my communing with God in secret for some time, the Lord told me to go immediately to see a poor sick girl near by. Mother accompanied me. Found her barely able to sit up, having been suffering for nearly one year. She had exhausted in vain all available medical aid. We spoke of the Great Physician. She said she believed that he was able to heal her. We called for oil, anointed her in the name of the Lord and laid hands on, and prayed for her present restoration to health. We entreated God with all the faith and earnestness of our inmost soul and then left her in the hands of God, with a comfortable degree of faith that God would raise her up again.</p>

<p>Eve, met at a quarter to eight. Mighty power filled the house. The altar was filled from one side to the other. Several were seeking sanctification. Glory to God, this night he began to give me some of the evidences (besides my hitherto naked faith) that I had got out of the wilderness into Canaan. Jesus, my blessed Savior, just cut me off one bunch of the sweet grapes of this &#8220;land.&#8221; Oh, glory to God, once more I was a little child! I felt the blood of Jesus flowing through my entire &#8220;soul, body, and spirit.&#8221; Heaven on earth! Hallelujah, it is done!</p>

<p><b>8.</b> Sabbath. At five this morning a goodly number met in the Bethel for prayers. The Spirit was with us. Returned to Brother Bell&#8217;s; ate a piece for breakfast, as we all felt that bodily wants were simple and few while the soul was so dearly fed with the bread of heaven. Met at half-past nine, and after many clear testimonies were given in for Jesus Brother Dunbar preached the word of life with great power and sweetness. Text, <span class="scripture">&#8220;For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+4%3A7" title="I&nbsp;Thessalonians 4:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Thessalonians 4:7)</span></a></span> He read much of the First Epistle to the Thessalonians, where this glorious second work is brought out so clear and forcibly. My soul was never before so wonderfully fed by the gospel in any sermon I ever heard. Oh, how sweet and glorious the word of life came to my renovated heart!</p>

<p>Mother, Sarah, and I went to Brother Furman&#8217;s for dinner. Returned to the two o&#8217;clock meeting. Among many clear witnesses I testified today to the blood that cleanses from all sin and also uncleanness of nature. The long altar was again crowded and several found sanctification in the blood. Some backsliders were restored. God is wonderfully at work. All glory to his name!</p>

<p>At six we met again in the Bethel, after spending a long time in the closet with God. The Spirit impressed me to talk to the people on the commands of Jesus, and in simplicity I did so, using <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+14%3A15">John 14:15</a> as a text. I read the word of the Lord concerning the duty of washing the saints&#8217; feet. Then we proceeded to obey the Lord. God wonderfully blessed me in talking, but my soul leaped for joy as I saw the dear sanctified ones come promptly to the bench and joyfully obey Him whom they love. God wonderfully blessed them, as they all testified the next day. Many of them had never seen the holy ordinance of feet washing observed before. The Church of God brethren had said that if these holiness people would obey these lowly commands then they would have confidence in them. Thank God, true holiness needs but to be tested to be proved genuine.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> This morn had to miss prayer meeting in order to take Mother Keller and our dear Levilla to the train, as they go to Upper Sandusky this morn. We will go by buggy at the close of meeting. Sister Bell and Sarah went to the country today to get berries. I wrote and prayed most of the forenoon. Then, feeling very empty and destitute of the stirrings of the Spirit, I sought God earnestly in secret and then started out to work for him. Visited and prayed with two families, but still felt destitute of the Comforter. Met at 2:30 P.M. at the house of God. Several observed that I was being much tried. But I was eager to defeat the enemy of my soul by testifying to the sanctifying power of the blood of Jesus. I did so, declaring that the blood of Jesus had washed from all sin. While I was talking, the Lord showed me that I had now entered upon the path of perfect trust in Jesus, and that as faith was eternal and unchangeable, I had forever abandoned the up-and-down road of feeling. I also (in an absent-minded manner) made the remark that I had been cheated out of the morning prayer meeting. But quick as thought I saw that it was wrong, for it was either complaining of or speaking lightly of God&#8217;s providence. This remark furnished a subject of meditation through the afternoon. I see how entirely loyal to God&#8217;s providence I now was. I felt that the above remark and all similar ones, so common and admissible in my past state, were not only wrong, but could not be true, as I have given myself, all I have, to God, surrendered all my ways, time, talents, means, influence, name, reputation, and everything with which I am connected&#8212;wife, child, friends, my destiny&#8212;all into the hands of God. I glorify in the blessed truth that no being in the whole universe can cheat me out of anything or do me the least harm. Glory to God forever! How happy I am in accepting all the will and providence of God! From the time of my testimony I realized the glorious river of life flowing through my entire being. What a sweet sense of perfect purity filled my mind and heart! Holiness was written everywhere. My very body seemed sacred and pure, a temple for the holy God. Glory to the cleansing power of the blood of Jesus!</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Precious Jesus, Thou hast saved me,
<br />Thine and only Thine I am;
<br />Oh, the precious blood has reached me!
<br />Glory, glory to the Lamb!</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Long my yearning heart was trying
<br />To enjoy this perfect rest;
<br />But I gave all trying over,
<br />Simply trusting, I was blessed.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Glory to the blood that bought me,
<br />Glory to its cleansing power,
<br />Glory to the blood that keeps me,
<br />Glory, glory evermore!</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Yes, I will stand up for Jesus;
<br />He has sweetly saved my soul,
<br />Cleansed me from inbred corruption,
<br />Sanctified and made me whole.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Oh, I can no longer doubt it,
<br />Hallelujah, I am free!
<br />Jesus saves me, soul and body,
<br />And He sweetly dwells in me.&#8221;</p>
