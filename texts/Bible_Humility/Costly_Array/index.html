<h1>Costly Array</h1>

<p>In the Revised Version this is translated &#8220;costly raiment.&#8221; It includes not only all superfluous outward adornment, but every expensive article of wearing apparel which would require an unnecessary outlay of the Lord&#8217;s means. In this respect, again, there might be a variety of opinion or of judgment as to what constitutes costly raiment, but no one who has reached the standard of Bible humility will find any difficulty in drawing the line for themselves or setting a good example for others who have not yet come to a true knowledge of this subject.</p>

<p>Modest apparel does not signify, as some would interpret, a carelessness of our outward appearance. We should always aim to be neat and presentable, unassuming and unattractive, always being careful to maintain a perfect correspondence in every respect with the plain teachings of the Word of God, so that we may be able to appear among the poor or the rich, as necessity may demand, without any unnecessary attraction to our clothing from either class, more than that distinction made by the Word of God, which certainly implies a beautiful, easy, and graceful medium, free from the awful bondage of fashion and style.</p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of dollars are annually expended by professing Christians for unnecessary dress. In our so-called Christian United States statistics show that there has been more money expended in one year for ostrich plumes than for the missionary cause. Of course, the professing Christians are not guilty of all this, but an alarming proportion of it is chargeable to them. Many professing Christians when requested to help the poor or when any need of the work of the gospel is presented to them, plead poverty themselves, when at the same time they practice real extravagance in their wearing apparel. There is not the least doubt but we all may economize in our personal expenses in this respect, and become much more able to be a blessing to others who are in need of actual necessities.</p>

<p>There is a most delightful liberty here, where Christ the hidden man of the heart has the perfect control. One of the greatest sins in the religious world is the idolatrous devotion of soul and body to the goddess of fashion and style. Thousands who once may have had a good experience of conversion, have been led captive by this subtle spirit of pride, and are now spiritually dead or else lean and starving; and yet perhaps, in some cases, not aware of the cause. An, dear soul, come with me and let us take a prayerful look into the mirror of God&#8217;s Word. You have forsaken God and bowed down to idols. Repent of this, ask forgiveness, and promise God all of your heart, soul, mind, and strength. Then apply to the cleansing fountain for a clean heart, and be filled with the Holy Spirit, so that the meek and humble Christ can dwell within and live the life of Himself in you. You have no time nor means to waste in the vain things of the world. Those things which are highly esteemed among men are an abomination in the sight of God.</p>

<p>The depraved mind of the world has no power to comprehend that which is truly beautiful in God&#8217;s sight. For the children of God to endeavor to appear beautiful to the eye of the world is therefore to greatly displease God. The ornament of a meek and quiet spirit will beautify the countenance, and cause it to shine forth with true heavenly brightness in the sight of God and before the world.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;In that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+28%3A5" title="Isaiah 28:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 28:5)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;For the Lord taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+149%3A4" title="Psalm 149:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 149:4)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+132%3A16" title="Psalm 132:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 132:16)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Chronicles+16%3A29" title="I&nbsp;Chronicles 16:29"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Chronicles 16:29)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Salvation is the only true adornment; therefore, the one which everyone must seek to obtain and that which God alone can give. This will shine forth with the fruits of the Spirit in true loveliness, and cause us to greatly glorify Him in good works, which come spontaneously from the hidden man of the heart, and make us a diadem of beauty in the sight of God. A heart thus filled with God will have no room, need, nor desire for the vain, worldly, outward adornments. Beloved reader, let us seek earnestly to meet every condition of perfect obedience to the blessed Word of God.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+12%3A1-2" title="Romans 12:1-2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 12:1-2)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+5%3A5-6" title="I&nbsp;Peter 5:5-6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 5:5-6)</span></a></span></p>
