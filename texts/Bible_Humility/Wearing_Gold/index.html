<h1>Wearing Gold</h1>

<p>Let us next consider the wearing of gold. This is plainly forbidden. A popular clergyman once said, &#8220;There is no place in the Bible where the wearing of gold is plainly forbidden.&#8221; What an utter contradiction of the Word of God! Peter say,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A3" title="I&nbsp;Peter 3:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 3:3)</span></a></span>
Paul says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+2%3A9" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 2:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 2:9)</span></a></span>
Here are two plain texts where the wearing of gold is forbidden.</p>

<p>It is remarkable what excuses people make who live in open violation of these Scriptures. Everyone seems to think God has granted them a special privilege of living in disobedience to His will in this respect. Many who make a loud profession of holiness wear gold rings, and other jewelry, and adorn themselves in the same vain apparel with the world. When their attention is called to this by some humble saint, they excuse themselves by saying, &#8220;Oh, I never think of these things.&#8221; Others have said they are so filled with God that they have not time to think or speak of these things. There are two reasons why such excuses are scripturally invalid, and the persons who make them are sadly ignorant or deceived. If these things were never thought of, they would never be put on. If they are worn because they had been put on before conversion and become perfectly natural to a person so that since conversion they have for this reason never thought of them, then such persons are ignorant of the Word of God, and need teaching. In such a case every honest, unbiased mind will at once accept the light of God&#8217;s Word upon the subject, and the Holy Spirit, the teacher and guide into all truth, will certainly make this matter plain.</p>

<p>Evidently there are cases where ignorance of God&#8217;s Word is excusable. There are some dear souls who have had no teaching; but the Holy Spirit will not leave such in the dark very long, if the heart is open to conviction. A dear brother who was a missionary to Africa told me of a touching instance, which shows how the Spirit will teach all who are willing to obey God. A converted heathen had brought his unsaved wife to the mission and made it their home. The wife would not yield to God, and became very much dissatisfied to remain at the mission. She insisted upon her husband going back to their old home, and living as they had done. The husband refused to do this, and insisted upon her to yield to God. She would not, and at last left the mission. He went after her and brought her back. She left again. He went again and brought her back, and did all he could, assisted by the missionaries, to bring her to repentance; but all was in vain, and she left again.</p>

<p>The poor husband came perplexed to the missionary, feeling in his heart that God&#8217;s Word must contain something to suit his case, and asked, &#8220;Teacher, what says God&#8217;s Word about a man whose wife won&#8217;t live with him because he&#8217;s a Christian?&#8221;</p>

<p>The missionary read to him <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+7%3A15">I&nbsp;Corinthians 7:15</a>&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;If the unbelieving depart, let him depart.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>The convert brightened up with joy, and said, &#8220;So my heart says.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every willing heart will always have a cheerful response to the Word of God; and if ignorant of the written Word, the Spirit will write the Word in the heart, so that when light comes from the written Word the heart says, &#8220;Amen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some excuse themselves in wearing a gold ring because it was given by some dear friend who now perhaps is gone, and the ring is worn in remembrance of the friend. This is certainly an excuse that no child of God should dare to make, in the face of the plain Word of God.</p>

<p>A dying lady once sent for me to come to see her. We had never met before, and as her pale hand lay upon her breast I was impressed in the Spirit to speak to her about a large gold ring she was wearing. She answered, &#8220;Oh, this ring was given me by my dear old father, who lives three thousand miles away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sister,&#8221; I said, &#8220;do you want to obey God? Could you not as well keep that ring as a remembrance of your father by putting it in your bureau drawer, and thus keep from violating God&#8217;s Word?&#8221; I marked the Scriptures for her and left, promising to return.</p>

<p>When I entered her room the next time, she held up her hand without the ring, saying, &#8220;Praise the Lord, brother!&#8221; She had received a wonderful blessing in her soul, and could not be thankful enough to God for having her attention called to this open violation of God&#8217;s Word. In a few days she passed into eternity, and my soul was overwhelmed with gratitude to God for the privilege of helping that dear soul to meet the divine requirement in this matter, and for her own testimony that she pleased God.</p>
