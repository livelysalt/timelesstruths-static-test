<h1>Outward Adornment</h1>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A3-5" title="I&nbsp;Peter 3:3-5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 3:3-5)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;I will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; but (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+2%3A8-10" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 2:8-10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 2:8-10)</span></a></span></p>

<p>These two texts show us the standard of Bible humility in outward adornment. They are the teaching of two different apostles, written at different times and places, and both express the same truth upon the subject. We all believe they were inspired by the Holy Spirit, and therefore should all accept what they have stated. The uniform teaching and spirit of the entire New Testament agrees therewith, and there should be a cheerful response in the heart of every professing child of God to the same.</p>

<p>We claim to take the whole New Testament for our rule of faith and practice, and unless our walk corresponds with and measures up to this standard, we are guilty of a gross inconsistency, and weaken the power and testimony of the Word of God to the world. The fruit of true humility must be borne out to the world. The hidden man of the heart will show out every characteristic of His nature&#8212;if it is the old man with his corrupted and depraved nature, or if it is the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. Seeing that we have put off the old man with his deeds, let us also see that all the furnishings and adornments that belong to him are put off, not only in our conversation and deeds but in our every appearance. A meek and quiet spirit in the heart, if unhindered, will permeate to the exterior, and will harmonize the outside with the nature of the inside.</p>

<p>In my native state the white oak tree grows very abundantly. In the fall of the year nearly all the trees shed their leaves, but the white oak holds tenaciously to its dead foliage all winter; even the beating storms of snow and sleet accomplish but little in stripping it. All the frozen elements and storms seem to cause it to cling tighter to the outward adornment of its old life. When the cruel blasts of winter are driven back by the April sun, we begin to notice a letting go of the tight grasp of the tree; and a gentle rain or a soft wind will bring down showers of leaves to the ground.</p>

<p>What is the matter with the tree? Ah, the new life on the inside is working its way up into the branches; the new buds are swelling and beginning to unfold. All that pertains to the old life must be put off. So it is with the blessed life of the Spirit of God. It will work out and crowd off everything that has ever been cherished by the old nature.</p>

<p>Many a child of God has been led astray by false teaching in this respect. Hireling preachers say that it matters not about the outside, just so the inside is all right. This false adage has been worn threadbare by professing Christians who seek to justify themselves in their pride. Many young converts have become perplexed, not knowing sufficiently well the voice of God, and the gentle leadings of the Holy Spirit, who would in every instance lead unerringly up to the Bible standard of outward adornment, but for the evil influences of worldly professors, who treat lightly the sacred Word of God and put false constructions upon those Scriptures, which if properly accepted would bring such professors under condemnation. Yes, dear reader, it does matter what is on the outside, because the Word of God says so, which the texts of Scripture quoted clearly show. The outside and inside must and do correspond. Jesus said to the Pharisees,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+23%3A26" title="Matthew 23:26"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 23:26)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>It is unquestionably true that real humility and modest apparel belong together, and no bodily ornamentation is desired, much less needed, where Christ is enthroned in the heart. The ornaments desired are: good works, inspired by the hidden man of the heart, with a modest, unassuming outward appearance.</p>
