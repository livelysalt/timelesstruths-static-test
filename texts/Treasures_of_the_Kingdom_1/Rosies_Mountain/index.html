<h1>Rosie&#8217;s Mountain</h1>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_1/rosiesmountain_picking.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="350" /></div>
<p>&#8220;One, two, three.&#8221; Six-year-old Rosie was picking dandelions. &#8220;Four, five, six,&#8221; she counted. This was Rosie&#8217;s special job, Mom had said, because they didn&#8217;t want the dandelions going to seed all over the lawn and garden. Mom had promised Rosie a sticker if she could pick one hundred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-one, twenty-two&#8230;.&#8221; Rosie turned the corner of the house and found big sister Irene weeding in the front flowerbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not time to play,&#8221; Irene stopped to frown at Rosie&#8217;s handful of bright dandelions, &#8220;There&#8217;s lots of work to do. Go to Mom and&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Rosie began, &#8220;Mom said I could&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Irene didn&#8217;t listen. &#8220;Hurry now! Mom said she needed us to get the weeding done this afternoon. You can pick flowers later.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosie turned quickly to hide the tears that were rolling down her cheeks. Irene didn&#8217;t understand! It just wasn&#8217;t fair! </p>

<p>She was hurrying towards the back porch when she heard Mom call. &#8220;Rosie, come here!&#8221; Rosie brushed the tears from her face and turned toward the garden where Mom was hoeing corn. </p>

<p>&#8220;Sit on my lap, dear. I want to tell you something,&#8221; Mom said, leaving her hoe to join Rosie on the grass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some things are hard, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221; Mom asked, wrapping an arm around her. </p>

<p>Rosie could hardly keep back the tears when she nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not only you,&#8221; Mom continued, &#8220;but each of us have to face hard things. Right?&#8221; Rosie nodded again. She knew that was true&#8212;only yesterday Cindy, her big brother Chad&#8217;s cat, had been run over by a car. That had been a very hard thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s like this.&#8221; Mom looked up over the pine trees that bordered the back fence&#8212;toward the purple hills in the distance. &#8220;We are climbing a mountain and each hard thing is like a rock to climb on. If you were climbing a hill and came to a big rock, what would happen if you climbed on top of it? Would you be higher up or lower down?&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_1/rosiesmountain_sad.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="287" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Higher up,&#8221; Rosie said, looking down at her fistful of drooping yellow flowers.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what if you thought that that rock was too high and too hard to climb, so you went the other way? Which way would you be going then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Down, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mom smiled, &#8220;That&#8217;s right. So if something hard happens&#8212;like when Irene said you weren&#8217;t working and scolded you for it&#8212;think of it as part of the mountain you have to climb. We won&#8217;t get very far if we never climb the rocks, and Jesus has promised to help us if we ask Him. Besides, the top is the best place: there is treasure for you there, Rosie. Jesus tells us that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like the treasure in Heaven we read about this morning?&#8221; Rosie asked. The tears had disappeared now and she was imagining a tall mountain with rocks to climb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Mom agreed, &#8220;And that is the best treasure of all, for it lasts forever.&#8221; She stood up and smiled down at Rosie, &#8220;Do you want to finish picking those dandelions for me? I see a big clump of them right over by the back porch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon Rosie&#8217;s hands were filled will yellow dandelions. It was not long before she called out, &#8220;Ninety-nine, one hundred. Oh, Mom, I got a hundred dandelions! May I get my sticker now?&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_1/rosiesmountain_stickers.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="160" /></div>
<p>&#8220;At suppertime,&#8221; Mom answered, &#8220;but that will not be long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you get a sticker for?&#8221; Daniel asked when they were washing up their hands for supper. He was eight and Rosie&#8217;s special buddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I worked for Mom,&#8221; Rosie smiled in satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; teased Chad who was drying his hands nearby, &#8220;I see. That smiley-face sticker is to remind you to do your work cheerfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; She answered softly. &#8220;It&#8217;s to remember the mountain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel heard her words and wanted to know, &#8220;What mountain?&#8221; And so Rosie told him about rock climbing and the treasure at the top.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; Daniel nodded thoughtfully as he slipped into his seat next to Chad. But when he looked at his plate he couldn&#8217;t help wrinkling his nose. It was potatoes with Swiss chard again&#8212;how he and Rosie disliked it! When Daniel lifted his head to look at her across the table he was surprised to see his sister&#8217;s little smile and wink. Well, of course&#8212;it was one of those rocks to climb! So Daniel winked back.</p>

<p>When Dad asked him to thank God for the food, Daniel managed a smile. &#8220;Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for this food. In Jesus&#8217; name, amen.&#8221; Swiss chard was still not on his favorite list, but maybe it was worth it for the treasure!</p>
