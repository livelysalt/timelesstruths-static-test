<h1>Rosie&#8217;s Mountain</h1>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_1/rosiesmountain_picking.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="350" /></div>
<p>&#8220;One, two, three.&#8221; Six-year-old Rosie was picking dandelions. &#8220;Four, five, six,&#8221; she counted. This was Rosie&#8217;s special job, Mom had said, because they didn&#8217;t want the dandelions going to seed all over the lawn and garden. Mom had promised Rosie a sticker if she could pick one hundred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-one, twenty-two&#8230;.&#8221; Rosie turned the corner of the house and found big sister Irene weeding in the front flowerbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not time to play,&#8221; Irene stopped to frown at Rosie&#8217;s handful of bright dandelions, &#8220;There&#8217;s lots of work to do. Go to Mom and&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Rosie began, &#8220;Mom said I could&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Irene didn&#8217;t listen. &#8220;Hurry now! Mom said she needed us to get the weeding done this afternoon. You can pick flowers later.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosie turned quickly to hide the tears that were rolling down her cheeks. Irene didn&#8217;t understand! It just wasn&#8217;t fair! </p>

<p>She was hurrying towards the back porch when she heard Mom call. &#8220;Rosie, come here!&#8221; Rosie brushed the tears from her face and turned toward the garden where Mom was hoeing corn. </p>

<p>&#8220;Sit on my lap, dear. I want to tell you something,&#8221; Mom said, leaving her hoe to join Rosie on the grass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some things are hard, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221; Mom asked, wrapping an arm around her. </p>

<p>Rosie could hardly keep back the tears when she nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not only you,&#8221; Mom continued, &#8220;but each of us have to face hard things. Right?&#8221; Rosie nodded again. She knew that was true&#8212;only yesterday Cindy, her big brother Chad&#8217;s cat, had been run over by a car. That had been a very hard thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s like this.&#8221; Mom looked up over the pine trees that bordered the back fence&#8212;toward the purple hills in the distance. &#8220;We are climbing a mountain and each hard thing is like a rock to climb on. If you were climbing a hill and came to a big rock, what would happen if you climbed on top of it? Would you be higher up or lower down?&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_1/rosiesmountain_sad.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="287" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Higher up,&#8221; Rosie said, looking down at her fistful of drooping yellow flowers.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what if you thought that that rock was too high and too hard to climb, so you went the other way? Which way would you be going then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Down, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mom smiled, &#8220;That&#8217;s right. So if something hard happens&#8212;like when Irene said you weren&#8217;t working and scolded you for it&#8212;think of it as part of the mountain you have to climb. We won&#8217;t get very far if we never climb the rocks, and Jesus has promised to help us if we ask Him. Besides, the top is the best place: there is treasure for you there, Rosie. Jesus tells us that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like the treasure in Heaven we read about this morning?&#8221; Rosie asked. The tears had disappeared now and she was imagining a tall mountain with rocks to climb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Mom agreed, &#8220;And that is the best treasure of all, for it lasts forever.&#8221; She stood up and smiled down at Rosie, &#8220;Do you want to finish picking those dandelions for me? I see a big clump of them right over by the back porch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon Rosie&#8217;s hands were filled will yellow dandelions. It was not long before she called out, &#8220;Ninety-nine, one hundred. Oh, Mom, I got a hundred dandelions! May I get my sticker now?&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_1/rosiesmountain_stickers.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="160" /></div>
<p>&#8220;At suppertime,&#8221; Mom answered, &#8220;but that will not be long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you get a sticker for?&#8221; Daniel asked when they were washing up their hands for supper. He was eight and Rosie&#8217;s special buddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I worked for Mom,&#8221; Rosie smiled in satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; teased Chad who was drying his hands nearby, &#8220;I see. That smiley-face sticker is to remind you to do your work cheerfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; She answered softly. &#8220;It&#8217;s to remember the mountain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel heard her words and wanted to know, &#8220;What mountain?&#8221; And so Rosie told him about rock climbing and the treasure at the top.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; Daniel nodded thoughtfully as he slipped into his seat next to Chad. But when he looked at his plate he couldn&#8217;t help wrinkling his nose. It was potatoes with Swiss chard again&#8212;how he and Rosie disliked it! When Daniel lifted his head to look at her across the table he was surprised to see his sister&#8217;s little smile and wink. Well, of course&#8212;it was one of those rocks to climb! So Daniel winked back.</p>

<p>When Dad asked him to thank God for the food, Daniel managed a smile. &#8220;Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for this food. In Jesus&#8217; name, amen.&#8221; Swiss chard was still not on his favorite list, but maybe it was worth it for the treasure!</p>

<h1>The Test of Love</h1>

<p>In the Bible we read
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But God commendeth [sent, entrusted] His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+5%3A8" title="Romans 5:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 5:8)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Christ Jesus died that we might be saved from our sins and live lives to please God, the great King. God loves us and He knew that we needed a Savior and Friend, so He sent Jesus. All who are sorry for their sin (because it displeases God very much, since He is so good and pure) can be made clean and pure, if they believe Jesus died for them and give themselves to serve and love Him.</p>

<p>Like Daniel and Rosie are learning, every one faces things that are hard&#8212;some are big, some are small. When we are saved, we should go to Jesus in every time of need: when we are afraid, or disappointed, or discouraged, or sad. Jesus is our Friend and will help us climb those hard rocks if we will ask Him. Jesus wants to be our Helper, that is one way God shows His love. </p>

<p>Hard places are like tests. The Lord wants to see how much we love Him and want to obey Him. Jesus said,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;If you love me, keep my commandments.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+14%3A15" title="John 14:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 14:15)</span></a></span>
If we love Him, He asks us to obey cheerfully, to do good to those that aren&#8217;t kind to us, to give up our own way to please others. These things are often hard, but Jesus has promised to help us. He lets hard things come to see if we will go to Him for help. How disappointed He is if we complain and sulk when things don&#8217;t go our way! But how happy Jesus is when we come to a hard place and run to Him for help right away!</p>

<p>So when you come to a rock on your mountain, remember it is a test. God has a treasure for you if you will just press on for it. That special treasure is called a blessing&#8212;and God planned for everyone to have it. Pray to God and ask for help when the hard place seems too big. God will never give you a rock too big to climb
 (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+10%3A13">I&nbsp;Corinthians 10:13</a>).

<h1>Dandelions</h1>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_1/dandelions_sidebar.jpg" alt="" width="118" height="600" /></div>
<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_1/dandelions_toseed.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="188" /></div>
<p>When you look at a field of dandelions, it is like bright drops of sunshine all over the ground. Dandelion flowers grow almost everywhere: in lawns and gardens, in sidewalk cracks and parks, on hills, in woods, and beside rivers. Many people call them weeds, but there are many interesting things to know about these sunshiny flowers that God made.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_1/dandelions_floret.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="68" /></div>
<p>Go outside and pick two dandelion flowers and look at them carefully. A dandelion that is fresh and new has rounded petals with a tight little bunch in the middle. Older flowers have a thin, curly, pollen-specked stigma next to each petal. Do you know that each flower is really a bunch of little flowers called &#8220;florets&#8221; all stuck together? Carefully pull of one of the dandelion petals. This petal is the floret, and there are more than a hundred on one dandelion. Why don&#8217;t you try counting them sometime?</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_1/dandelions_flower.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="150" /></div>
<p>Dandelions are one of the best flowers for spreading their seeds everywhere. When you see a round, silver blowball, you are looking at a package of dandelion seeds, each with a silky parachute ready to sail away and grow. Where each petal used to be is now a small brown seed. Some seeds have been blown many miles by the wind and have grown up far from where the golden dandelion had been. A dandelion has a very long rott&#8212;sometimes longer than your leg&#8212;so even when it is pulled up, the plant grows back again. That is how God designed them to live a long time.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_1/dandelions_blowball.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="178" /></div>
<p>A dandelion plant is very useful. Many animals and birds eat its smooth, hooked-edged leaves and parachute seeds. Dandelions often grow where other flowers and plants can&#8217;t, like in the city. Here they are helpful because the bees and butterflies need flower nectar to drink. Another useful thing is that you can pick as many as you want! You can write with them on the sidewalk, or use them to make a bright boquet to cheer someone up. So, even though people don&#8217;t like them in their lawns and gardens, dandelions aren&#8217;t just weeds.</p>

<h2>How to make a Dandelion Chain:</h2>
<ul>
<li>First pick the dandelion flowers. The best kinds are those that have big flowers and thick stems. Make sure the stems are about as long as from your wrist to your finger-tips.</li>

<li>Choose a large dandelion with a thick stem to start with. Carefully pinch the middle of the stem with your fingernails to make a slit in it. Take a second flower and push its stem through the slit. Pull carefully until the new flower is right next to the slit in the stem. You now have begun a dandelion chain!</li>

<li>Continue to make slits in each of the new dandelion stems you put in and add another flower. If a stem breaks or splits all the way open, just throw that flower away and get a new one.</li>

<li>Make the chain as long as you want it. Hang it in your play-house, fort, or decorate the kitchen table with it. You can also try to see how long you can make your chain before it breaks. What other things could you do with a dandelion chain?</li>

</ul>

<p>Grandpa had come over to visit and when he had settled himself in Daddy&#8217;s big easy chair, Alice, Edward, and Sammy gathered around him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us a story,&#8221; begged seven-year-old Edward.</p>

<p>Grandpa leaned back and thought awhile. Then he said, &#8220;Well, children, I will tell you one of the tales of truth found in the Bible. It is called:</p>

<h1>Two Boys and a Pot of Oil</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Kings+4%3A1-7">II&nbsp;Kings 4:1-7</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">In the days when kings ruled the land of Israel, there lived a poor woman and her two sons, whom I will call Asa and Benjamin. They were quite sad because their daddy had died and their mother had no money left. All they had was one pot of oil.</p>

<p>One day a man came to their house who wanted his money back, for their mother had borrowed it to buy some things they needed. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t,&#8221; he growled harshly, &#8220;I will take these two boys to be my slaves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Asa and Benjamin were quite afraid, but their mother was a brave woman and said to them, &#8220;I shall go find that prophet of God, named Elisha. I heard that once he made the water good when it was making everyone sick. Surely, he will help us.&#8221; So they watched their dear mother hurry away to find the prophet.</p>

<p>After awhile Mother returned. &#8220;Listen, my sons,&#8221; she said to them, &#8220;Elisha told us to go to all the neighbors and borrow all the pots, jars, and jugs we could.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the boys hurried over to the neighbors and knocked on the door. &#8220;May we please borrow your pots and jugs?&#8221; they asked. Soon Asa and Benjamin&#8217;s arms were full and they hurried back home. All afternoon the boys worked hard carrying jars and jugs, pots and pans to their mother. They got tired, but they knew they mustn&#8217;t stop until they brought home every one. At last there was no more left to bring.</p>

<p>&#8220;What will we do now?&#8221; Benjamin looked at the little house filled with pots, jars, and jugs. Mother picked up their own little pot of oil and began to pour it into one of the borrowed jugs. As the boys watched they were surprised to see that each jug was filled. </p>

<p>At last Mother looked around and said, &#8220;Asa, get me another jug.&#8221; But there was not another jug left. All had been filled! Now their own little pot of oil was all used up. God had made it last and last and last until they had filled the last jug.</p>

<p>Now Asa and Benjamin and their mother were happy. They sold some of the oil and paid back the man. They sold the rest of the oil and bought many things they needed. God had taken care of them, and He can take care of you. All you need to do is ask Him and obey when He tells you what to do.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>&#8220;Was that man really going to make them his slaves?&#8221; asked wide-eyed Sammy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sometimes people were made slaves if they didn&#8217;t pay their debts,&#8221; said Grandpa. &#8220;The slaves had to do whatever their master said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be his slave,&#8221; Edward said boldly. &#8220;I&#8217;d just&#8212;I&#8217;d&#8212;I&#8217;d do <i>something</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But do you think they did the right thing?&#8221; Grandpa asked them.</p>

<p>&#8220;They asked God to help them,&#8221; Alice answered. &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that the right thing to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Grandpa smiled, &#8220;Yes, God wants us to go to Him whenever we need help.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Doing What Is Right</h1>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_1/doingright_sidebar.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="800" /></div>
<p>Once there was a boy named Jonathan. He trusted in God to help him do the right thing.</p>

<p>Not many others still wanted to do the right thing. They were afraid to do what was right.</p>

<p>There was another boy who wanted to do right. &#8220;I&#8217;m with you!&#8221; he said. So they worked very hard, climbing up a mountain with their hands and feet, to get in a place where they could see what was wrong. When they got there, they looked out at the wrongdoers. There were a lot of them and they looked very mean.</p>

<p>Then Jonathan and his friend prayed like this: &#8220;Lord, if they make fun of us, then we will know that you will help us win over the wrong. It doesn&#8217;t matter if there is a lot of wrongdoers against just two. You can help the right to win.&#8221; They prayed very hard, for they knew if the Lord did not help them that they would be in trouble.</p>

<p>The Lord heard their prayer. He gave them great strength to do the right.</p>

<p>It was very hard. They fought with the wrongdoers all over a large area of ground. They stomped all over the grass and bushes. There was a lot of yelling and noise. The wrongdoers were very mad and were determined to win.</p>

<p>But Jonathan and his friend were helped of the Lord. They were very tired and hungry, but the wrongdoers began to run. So Jonathan and his friend chased them. Other people who wanted to do what was right began to chase the wrongdoers away, too.</p>

<p>Then they were happy. They had done the right thing, and God was pleased with them.</p>

<p>Today, we fight the battle against wrong in our hearts. God will help us if we are willing to work hard. He will help us to see what is wrong. He will answer our prayers and help us to chase the wrong away. And maybe others will do right, too. Then the world will be a better place.</p>

<p>If we fight against the wrong and win when we are growing up, then we will be able to fight against bigger wrongs when we are older. It is time to learn how to win now.</p>

<p>Many big people wish they had learned to fight against wrong when they were your age. They would be better off now. But you can do what is right now.</p>

<p>Here is a Bible verse for you.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;God is faithful, who will not suffer [allow] you to be tempted above that ye are able.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+10%3A13" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 10:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 10:13)</span></a></span>
It is in your Bible. You will find it in the book of First Corinthians, chapter 10, and verse 13. It means that God will make it possible for you to win. He promises that He will not let anything too hard for you come. If may seem too hard, but it is not, if you pray and trust God to help you. With God, you can win over anything that is wrong!</p>

<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">My dear girls,</p>

<p>Sometimes little girls like to dream about living in a big palace, walking through lovely flower gardens with beautiful dresses, and lovely curls of hair sweeping over a neck strung with pearls. A princess that reads and plays in the garden and eats chocolates and sings beautiful songs&#8230;&#8203;a princess that has a father who is a King who sits on a royal throne. Oh, to be a princess! I suppose there is not a girl on earth who did not want to be a princess at some time. </p>

<p>Did you know, girls, that you can be princesses? Your heavenly Father is a King and if you give your heart and life to Him, you can be His royal daughter, a princess. Your heavenly Father&#8217;s name is King Jesus and being His princess is the best thing in the world. He makes His daughters into the most beautiful princesses in the world and puts all sorts of fine jewels on them&#8212;yes, gold, diamonds, pearls, and rubies. King Jesus says that His daughters have clothes that are made of pure gold! </p>

<p>Would you like to wear this dress of pure gold?</p>

<p>This dress of gold is made by our obedience to King Jesus. Every time we obey King Jesus in something He tells us to do, He puts another stitch into our dress of gold. King Jesus might give us orders through our mothers. He might tell her to say, &#8220;Now pick up the toys; it is time for bed.&#8221; Then if we pick up our toys cheerfully and obediently, another stitch goes into our dress of pure gold. </p>

<p>But sometimes little princesses are not always cheerful. Sometimes they forget to obey. Then all the angels are very sad and their tears fall on the dress of pure gold, and one stitch turns black and falls out, leaving a dark hole in the dress of pure gold. How sad! I hope you never disobey our King Jesus or His Commanders (Mama and Daddy). For if you disobey, your dress of pure gold will be messed up, and you will also be very unhappy. </p>

<p>But if you obey cheerfully all the time, not only will you get a dress made of pure gold, but you will be happy too! </p>

<p>I hope and pray that you will be an obedient princess, one who has clothes of pure gold and King Jesus can smile at you and say, &#8220;That is my obedient princess, and I am making a dress of pure gold for her!&#8221; </p>

<p class="signature">With love,<br />Aunt Grace</p>

<p>P.S. You can find the scripture about the King&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s pure gold clothes in the book of <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+45%3A13">Psalms, chapter 45, and verse 13</a>.</p>

<h1>Dear Reader</h1>

<p>As this is the first issue of <i>Treasures of the Kingdom</i>, we thought it good to add some opening remarks and hopes for the future.</p>

<p><i>Treasures of the Kingdom</i> is designed for boys and girls ages five to ten. Seeing a need for the truth to be brought to the young, we have purposed, with God&#8217;s help, to supply that need by printing material that builds godly character, spiritual direction, and gives practical instruction. As a little candle, we desire to shed God&#8217;s Light &#8217;round about us in this dark world.</p>

<p>We are a Bible-believing family that belongs to the church God built in the New Testament. Out family consists of Rick and Krista Erickson and their five children: Laura (18), Skye (17), Joel (16), Kara (14), and Amanda (6). We live on a small acreage, and are home educated. The publishing of <i>Treasures of the Kingdom</i> is mainly done by Laura and Joel, with help from others, including contributions from our friends, the Spinks family, and guidance by our parents.</p>

<p>In printing <i>Treasures of the Kingdom</i> we are aiming for a high standard. The contents of each issue will be measured against Bible standards and suitableness for the set age range. We plan to print the existing features in each issue, which will be sent out bimonthly, Lord willing. We also desire to include in the future a column for children to share what they have learned.</p>

<p class="signature">In His service,<br />The Editors</p>
