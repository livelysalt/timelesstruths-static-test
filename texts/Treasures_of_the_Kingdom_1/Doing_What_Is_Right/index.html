<h1>Doing What Is Right</h1>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_1/doingright_sidebar.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="800" /></div>
<p>Once there was a boy named Jonathan. He trusted in God to help him do the right thing.</p>

<p>Not many others still wanted to do the right thing. They were afraid to do what was right.</p>

<p>There was another boy who wanted to do right. &#8220;I&#8217;m with you!&#8221; he said. So they worked very hard, climbing up a mountain with their hands and feet, to get in a place where they could see what was wrong. When they got there, they looked out at the wrongdoers. There were a lot of them and they looked very mean.</p>

<p>Then Jonathan and his friend prayed like this: &#8220;Lord, if they make fun of us, then we will know that you will help us win over the wrong. It doesn&#8217;t matter if there is a lot of wrongdoers against just two. You can help the right to win.&#8221; They prayed very hard, for they knew if the Lord did not help them that they would be in trouble.</p>

<p>The Lord heard their prayer. He gave them great strength to do the right.</p>

<p>It was very hard. They fought with the wrongdoers all over a large area of ground. They stomped all over the grass and bushes. There was a lot of yelling and noise. The wrongdoers were very mad and were determined to win.</p>

<p>But Jonathan and his friend were helped of the Lord. They were very tired and hungry, but the wrongdoers began to run. So Jonathan and his friend chased them. Other people who wanted to do what was right began to chase the wrongdoers away, too.</p>

<p>Then they were happy. They had done the right thing, and God was pleased with them.</p>

<p>Today, we fight the battle against wrong in our hearts. God will help us if we are willing to work hard. He will help us to see what is wrong. He will answer our prayers and help us to chase the wrong away. And maybe others will do right, too. Then the world will be a better place.</p>

<p>If we fight against the wrong and win when we are growing up, then we will be able to fight against bigger wrongs when we are older. It is time to learn how to win now.</p>

<p>Many big people wish they had learned to fight against wrong when they were your age. They would be better off now. But you can do what is right now.</p>

<p>Here is a Bible verse for you.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;God is faithful, who will not suffer [allow] you to be tempted above that ye are able.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+10%3A13" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 10:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 10:13)</span></a></span>
It is in your Bible. You will find it in the book of First Corinthians, chapter 10, and verse 13. It means that God will make it possible for you to win. He promises that He will not let anything too hard for you come. If may seem too hard, but it is not, if you pray and trust God to help you. With God, you can win over anything that is wrong!</p>
