<h1>Dear Reader</h1>

<p>We present this little volume to you in the name of our King, Jesus Christ, who has made it possible. It is through His mercy that we can be at peace with our Heavenly Father. It is through His grace&#8212;that ever present help we so desperately need&#8212;that we daily live in the light of heaven. Praise be to Him for His faithful loving care for us!</p>

<p>In this song and story collection we have selected the stories from old books that hold up the values of the Bible. In pairing them with the songs (reprinted from the first 12 issues of Treasures of the Kingdom) we have tried to match the themes. Topics such as salvation, forgiving those that wrong us, and conquering in our trials are indeed hard to find. We are glad that the truth in them is not out-dated for practical application today. In the darkness of this generation may you be stirred to turn again to the &#8220;old paths&#8221; of righteousness as you read these pages.</p>

<p>There are &#8220;treasures of the kingdom&#8221; yet to claim. The heavenly way is just as real and true as it ever was, but only the earnest seekers will find it. The Savior&#8217;s words are, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+10%3A15" title="Mark 10:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 10:15)</span></a></span> Then, for us all, these stories of childlike trust and simplicity in life are an important reminder of a living Heavenly Father who still cares for His own. The question is, will you be His child?</p>

<p class="signature">Our love and prayers,<br />The Editors</p>

<h1>Begin Now</h1>

<p class="author">Author Unknown</p>

<p>It was a lovely morning, very early in spring. As there was still half an hour before schooltime, Basil Morton, with his books under his arm, stopped in the garden to talk to his father, who was busy clearing away the weeds from a narrow slip of ground which ran just beneath the wall, from the summer-house to the gate. On his right hand lay a heap of rubbish to be taken away the next time the gardener came by; and on his left, at a little distance, were some tulip-roots which he was going to plant along the border. The father and son were both in earnest talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Father,&#8221; said Basil, in answer to a remark that his father had made, &#8220;I confess that I am a little idle now and then. I do neglect my lessons sometimes; and lose my place in the class; and that may have been one reason why I did not bring home a prize last Christmas, as well as my cousin John. But indeed I am not a dunce, as you seem to think. I can learn as well and as fast as John, when I take pains to do so. Mr. Taylor himself says that I can. So you need not be afraid that I shall grow up a stupid boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But when shall you begin to improve?&#8221; asked his father. &#8220;You are ten years old this month; let us see how much you have learned up to the present time. You can read and write pretty well; your spelling, I fear, is not to be praised; but you have learned your tables, and can work an easy sum, and copy a page of Latin, with not more than three mistakes in each line.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Father!&#8221; said Basil, blushing, and looking ashamed, for he knew that his father was speaking the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. Morton went on very gravely: &#8220;From a boy of ten years old, who has had all the needful means of gaining knowledge, we expect something more than this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, dear Father,&#8221; said Basil, &#8220;ten is not such a very great age; and I hope that I shall improve, as I grow older. I mean to be as good a Latin scholar as my cousin John, or any boy in the school. And as for spelling, surely I will spell better in time. In figures, too, I shall get on faster by and by: indeed, I have some thought of trying for that prize next half-year. Only wait a little longer, and I shall be able to help you in the office: I shall write some of the letters for you, and look over the accounts. Only wait a little longer.&#8221; And Basil&#8217;s looks showed that he meant what he said.</p>

<p>But Mr. Morton still looked grave. &#8220;Ah! That is the old story, my boy,&#8221; said he, with a shake of his head; and then went on with his gardening in silence. The truth was that Basil had a very bad habit, which gave his father much concern. When a fault was pointed out to him, he was always ready to own it, and would promise to amend; but then the amendment was to be at some distant day. The promise to improve was never given for the present time; it was always of the future that he spoke. He never said, &#8220;I will try to do better at once; I will begin <i>today.</i>&#8221; If he had been in disgrace at school, he would comfort himself with saying, &#8220;It cannot be helped; no doubt I shall be as wise as the other boys, in time.&#8221; If his mother found it needful to reprove him for being careless, or for leaving his books and playthings in a litter, his answer was almost sure to be, &#8220;I know it was wrong, dear mother, and I am very sorry; I hope that I shall become more careful as I grow older.&#8221;</p>

<p>This fault was also to be seen in matters of far greater concern. His parents, or a good friend, would speak to him about his soul, and urge him to pray for the pardon of his sins, and for the new heart which is the gift of the Holy Spirit. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he would say, &#8220;I wish to think of these things; and if I live to be a man, I hope that I shall love God, and keep his commandments, and do all the good I can.&#8221; Again and again he had been told of the danger of delay, yet still he talked of &#8220;by and by,&#8221; while, in the mean time, all his bad habits were growing stronger. And the stronger they grew, the less likely it became that he should fulfill his promises of amendment at a future day.</p>

<p>Mr. Morton went on with his gardening, and Basil also stood for some time without speaking, until his father had done weeding, and all was ready for the tulip-roots to be put into the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that a double row of tulips will look very handsome here,&#8221; said Mr. Morton, &#8220;and I intend that they shall be the finest in the garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I stay and give you the roots?&#8221; said Basil, glad of an excuse for keeping away from school.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; said his father, &#8220;the border will do very nicely, I dare say. The weeds have been dug out, and the soil is good. Some splendid tulips will be seen there by and by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But not unless you plant the roots, Father,&#8221; said Basil, looking with surprise at his parent, who had taken up the tulip-roots from the ground, and was walking away. &#8220;If you leave the border as it is, the weeds will grow up again, but it is not likely that we shall see any tulips.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_1/01_bulbs.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="437" /></div>
<p>&#8220;I assure you,&#8221; said Mr. Morton, &#8220;that I hope to have some very fine ones there. I intend that everyone who sees it shall admire that border.&#8221; Then calling to the gardener, who was at work not far off, he gave him the tulip-roots, and told him to put them away in a proper place. &#8220;Now, Basil,&#8221; said he, when the man was gone, &#8220;it is time that you were at school; and as I also am going into the town, we can walk together a little way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said Basil, as they went along, &#8220;I cannot make out what you are thinking of about that tulip-bed. Are you going to buy some roots of a finer sort, or do you think it is at present too early to put them in the ground?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not suppose,&#8221; said Mr. Morton, &#8220;that I should be able to procure a finer sort in the town; and gardeners say that this is the month in which they should be planted. Go on, my boy, and tell me what it is that you cannot make out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is this: you have dug the ground, and cleared out the weeds, and leveled the soil; but you have not put in the roots, and yet you talk about seeing the tulips by and by, as if they would come up of themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does seem rather strange to you, I dare say,&#8221; said Mr. Morton. &#8220;And yet, Basil, I know a person who expects many things to happen which we have at present scarcely more reason to suppose will ever come to pass. What are we to think of the boy who expects that without care and without study he shall, by and by, become a good Latin scholar, obtain the school-prize for his sums, and be able to help his father in his office, to write letters of business, and to look over accounts? It would indeed be folly to seek for tulips in a garden where none have been planted; but it is still more foolish to expect the fruits of knowledge from the mind which, like a neglected garden, has run to waste. If the root is not planted, if the seed is not sown, we know that only useless or hurtful weeds will spring up out of the earth: and thus it is with the heart. If the seeds of wisdom are not sown, and if good habits are not gained by the youth, we have no just reason to look for sound knowledge or correct conduct from the man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Basil hung down his head, and Mr. Morton went on: &#8220;It is not too late, my boy, for me to plant the tulip-roots; and it is not too late for you to receive the seeds of learning and goodness into your mind. Only begin <i>at once.</i> Remember that if we would gather flowers in the summer, we must plant them in the spring; and instead of saying, &#8216;I shall improve by and by,&#8217; you should begin <i>now.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;But, above all things, take care that you begin at the beginning. You are a sinner, and you need the pardon of your sins, and the grace of God to strengthen your good desires. Go, then, to Jesus, Who died to take away sin, and Who alone can save your soul. Ask Him to have pity upon you; and pray that He will send down His Holy Spirit to change your sinful nature, and to sow within your heart the seeds of eternal life.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Reader, do you desire to have your sins forgiven, and to be at peace with God? Delay not for a single day, but seek your Savior now.</p>

<p class="verse">O Thou Who art the God of truth,<br />Pardon the follies of my youth,<br />The secret sins of heart and thought,<br />And all the ill that I have wrought.</p>

<p class="verse">Oh, where can trembling sinners flee?<br />To no one, Jesus, save to Thee;<br />Thy life and death, Thy cross and grave,<br />Proclaim Thy willingness to save.</p>

<p class="verse">To me Thy tender mercy show,<br />Thy great salvation may I know;<br />And, by Thy Spirit&#8217;s grace, impart<br />To me a new and holy heart.</p>

<h1>Making Others Happy</h1>

<p class="author">Lillian Payson</p>

<p>It was examination day at Bert&#8217;s school. Some of the mothers and aunts sat in chairs behind the teacher&#8217;s table. And Bert&#8217;s grandma was there, too, with her beautiful, gray hair that Bert liked so much. Then there were the school committee members, Dr. Bell and Mr. White. Of course, all the children wanted to be perfect in reading and spelling that day, if they never were before. When it was all over, Dr. Bell told the children that he thought they must have had a very happy time in school, because they had learned their lessons so well.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I hope you will all have a very happy vacation. How can you do it? What will make you happy, boys and girls?&#8221;</p>

<p>Up went the hands&#8212;one, two, three, four, five.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_1/02_question.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="667" /></div>
<p>&#8220;That little girl may tell me,&#8221; said Dr. Bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Play,&#8221; said Mabel.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what do you say, Robbie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go berrying,&#8221; answered Robbie, with a little smack of his lips.</p>

<p>And so one after another answered. Some said &#8220;Play,&#8221; some &#8220;Swing,&#8221; &#8220;Work in the garden,&#8221; &#8220;Go to Grandma&#8217;s,&#8221; and many other answers.</p>

<p>After a bit, Dr. Bell saw Bert&#8217;s hand come up. &#8220;Well, Bert, what are you going to do to be happy?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Bert&#8217;s eyes twinkled, and his face laughed all over as he said, &#8220;Make other ones happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Dr. Bell. &#8220;I like Bert&#8217;s plan best of all. I like to see children enjoy their play, and their gardens, and swings, and berry picking. But, wherever you are, boys and girls, whatever else you do, the thing that will be most sure to make the vacation happy is to try to make other people happy, forgetting all about yourself. Let me tell you about one of the happiest families I know.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the morning Nell and Daisy help their mamma, or smooth her forehead when she has a headache. Sometimes they try to do a little sewing for her, though they don&#8217;t know how very well. Even little Harry will run to the kitchen with a message for Bridget. Then, when mamma tells them they may go out to play, the girls take their brothers, too; and many times they give up playing what they would like themselves, so that they may please the little boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Their mother is often sick, so I have become quite well acquainted with the children in my visits; and they are such happy children that I often wish all boys and girls knew how happy they might be if they would follow the same plan. Bert has thought it out, you see, and if he and all the rest of you boys and girls only try, this vacation, to make others happy, I know I shall have my wish. What was it I wished you, children?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A happy vacation,&#8221; they answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the doctor, &#8220;and how can you be happy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make others happy,&#8221; they said again.</p>

<p>And I hope they all remembered.</p>

<h1>Children of the Kingdom</h1>

<p class="author">Author Unknown</p>

<p>The afternoon sunlight, streaming brightly through the windows of the little old-fashioned church, gilded the fair young heads in the choir, and down a broad golden path slid a quivering crown upon the good old minister&#8217;s silver hair. Daisy and Bob Saybrook sat in the square pew under the pulpit, tightly wedged in between Aunt Skinner and mischievous Cousin John, and listened with more than their usual attention to the words of the sermon. The text was so very sweet&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father&#8217;s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+12%3A32" title="Luke 12:32"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 12:32)</span></a></span></p>

<p>The tears came in Daisy&#8217;s eyes. She looked at Uncle Skinner, but he had settled down with his eyes shut, probably so that his attention might not be distracted by anything earthly. Aunt Skinner was taking a pinch of snuff, and John was scrawling in the hymn book, drawing pictures of dogs worrying cats, and another one, which made Daisy shudder, of a man hanging on a gallows. But Bob&#8212;that was a comfort&#8212;gave her a bright look of sympathy; and pressing each other&#8217;s hands, they listened with eager ears.</p>

<p>Now Bob and Daisy were orphans, and it was only a few weeks since their dear mother had died, and they had come to live with Uncle and Aunt Skinner. No one in all the world can take the place of a precious mother; so, although Aunt Skinner tried to be very kind, they could not yet feel at all happy in their new home, and they had to struggle very hard against a feeling of positive dislike towards their cousin John. He was older and stronger than Bob, and was continually doing every thing in his power to make his young cousins uncomfortable. Even now, as they sat in church, he would now and then vary his occupation of drawing by giving Daisy a violent pinch, which would make her start off her seat. Then Aunt Skinner would give her such a sharp look that the child&#8217;s heart would be nearly broken. So it is no wonder that these little children listened so eagerly to the comforting words of the good old minister. He told them such wonderful things of the glorious King who made all the shining worlds, of His great, white throne, and His angels, beautiful because they had stood so long in His light, the harpers, harping with harps, and the cherubim veiling their faces because the glory was so great. But this wonderful King so loved the little world that He sent His Son to die upon the cross, that all His sinful, wandering, earth-children might come back to His love. And he, the great King, would be their Father, Jesus his glorious Son their elder brother, and they with him should be heirs of the <i>kingdom.</i> &#8220;Behold, what manner of love!&#8221; said the good minister, with tears in his eyes. &#8220;Through this dear, Elder Brother we can even come nearer God&#8217;s heart than the angels.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daisy looked at Bob with a glad surprise; and when service was over, they walked slowly home, talking it over together. They had often talked before with their dear mother, and when she died, she hoped that she left them both <span class="scripture">&#8220;followers of God, as dear children.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A1" title="Ephesians 5:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 5:1)</span></a></span> But Daisy felt troubled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob,&#8221; said she, anxiously, &#8220;do you really think we are children of the kingdom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I hope so; but I&#8217;ll tell you what I did in church, Daisy. I gave my heart to God over again, and I promised to study his Book more, and find out all he wishes me to do, and then I&#8217;ll do it with all my might.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I will, too,&#8221; said Daisy, lifting her clear eyes to heaven.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll tell you what, Daisy, we&#8217;ll have a tough time trying to do <i>some</i> things. What do you think of&#8212;&#8216;Love your enemies?&#8217; Now there&#8217;s John&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, to be sure, my arm is all black and blue; but then I feel now as if I forgave him. And, indeed, Bob,&#8221; said she, slowly, &#8220;I&#8217;m not quite sure, but I think I could almost love him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, indeed!&#8221; sneered a voice behind them, &#8220;don&#8217;t put yourself out too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daisy colored violently. &#8220;Have you heard all we said?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had the privilege,&#8221; said John, in a nasal tone, &#8220;of listening to most of your edifying conversation. It was a great treat for such a poor sinner, I assure you. It&#8217;s so <i>very</i> affecting to think that these dear lambs of the flock can love a poor goat with such very long horns&#8221;; and he pretended to wipe his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, John,&#8221; said Daisy, deprecatingly, &#8220;you know we did not mean to say any thing so bad. We want to love you very much, but you will not let us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why not, pray, Miss Sanctity?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You need only look at her arm,&#8221; cried Bob, indignantly, &#8220;and you&#8217;ll have one answer. And I&#8217;ll tell you what, John Skinner, you&#8217;ll have to stop that fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah?&#8221; said he, with provoking coolness. &#8220;Will the little lamb fight? I thought it could only bleat, and cry for its ma.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tears sprang into Bob&#8217;s eyes at that heartless allusion to his recent sorrow, and a voice whispered in his heart, &#8220;It&#8217;s no use&#8212;give up trying to be one of God&#8217;s children, and pitch into John Skinner just once.&#8221; But he struggled against the feeling, though his hands clenched involuntarily, while he prayed for help. Daisy, too, would not trust herself to speak, and walked on silently, while John sang scraps of psalm-tunes through his nose, all the way home.</p>

<p>Arrived at the door, John turned to Daisy. &#8220;My dear, <i>Christian</i> friend, I have such a pleasant surprise for you.&#8221; Daisy followed him apprehensively through the garden to the barn, when, opening the door, out walked her little pet kitten, Pearl, her pure, white fur dabbled with streaks of red and yellow paint, looking like a little clown kitten.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_1/03_cat.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="486" /></div>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said John, while Daisy uttered an exclamation of dismay, &#8220;I knew your taste in <i>colors,</i> because you admired the sunset so much last night. I&#8217;m so glad I have pleased you&#8221;; and he grinned maliciously.</p>

<p>The kitten mewed piteously, as if in great pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I declare,&#8221; said John, &#8220;I believe she has been trying to lick it off. I hadn&#8217;t the least idea that she had a <i>taste</i> for color, too&#8221;; and he laughed loudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a cruel boy, John,&#8221; cried Bob, coming up. &#8220;That poor kitten has swallowed too much paint, and will die before night.&#8221;</p>

<p>John only laughed louder, while Daisy tenderly took her kitten, and with Bob&#8217;s help washed it with soap and warm water. The poor kitten seemed grateful, but lay languidly in Daisy&#8217;s lap till night, when, as Bob predicted, it died.</p>

<p>Daisy could not be comforted, and Bob indignantly told Aunt Skinner the whole story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, John is always up to his tricks,&#8221; said she, a little impatiently, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t think that little bit of paint hurt the kitten at all. It always <i>was</i> sickly. Daisy played with it too much. But don&#8217;t cry, child,&#8221; she added, more kindly; &#8220;you shall have another some time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will never be like Pearl,&#8221; sobbed Daisy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Sister Saybrook,&#8221; drawled John, passing her little stool, &#8220;you must set your affections on things above.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Daisy,&#8221; whispered Bob, as they lighted their candles to go to bed, &#8220;could you love John now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me,&#8221; cried poor Daisy, in a choking voice. &#8220;It&#8217;s as much as I can do not to <i>hate</i> him tonight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Daisy prayed so earnestly that God would take all bitterness out of her heart, that in the morning she was able to look quite cheerful, and spoke so pleasantly to John that he was greatly disappointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t love her kitten so much, after all,&#8221; said he to himself.</p>

<p>But now Bob was in trouble. One of his boots was nowhere to be found. His other pair had gone to be mended, and it was almost school-time. High and low pattered the willing feet of little Daisy, but all in vain.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a very careless boy,&#8221; cried Aunt Skinner; &#8220;John never did such a thing in his life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe John has done it now, then,&#8221; sighed Daisy to herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I must stay at home from school,&#8221; cried Bob, bitterly; &#8220;and I was so anxious not to lose my place.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no help for it, and Daisy left her brother with an aching heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all John,&#8221; cried Bob, fiercely, when he was left alone. &#8220;Now I&#8217;ve lost my place at the head. Oh, I just <i>hate</i>&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Stop a minute, Bob,</i> said his good angel. <i>There are worse things than losing one&#8217;s place at school. Remember your Father sees everything, and if you do right, and conquer these wicked thoughts, John can&#8217;t make you lose your place in the kingdom.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure!&#8221; said Bob, more cheerily; &#8220;how could I forget it for a moment?&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then a bright idea came into his head, and hurrying to the barn, he found an old cast-off boot of Uncle Skinner&#8217;s. It was a world too large, but Bob drew it on, and clattered bravely away to school. There was a great laugh when he made his appearance, but he kept his place at the head, and felt very happy. At night, John sullenly threw the missing boot into the room. &#8220;Where did you find it?&#8221; asked Aunt Skinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Under a chair in his room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, John!&#8221; cried Bob and Daisy together.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true,&#8221; said John. &#8220;But you&#8217;re just a couple of bats, and can&#8217;t see an inch beyond your noses.&#8221; Bob and Daisy looked at each other, but knew it was useless to say any more. A day or two after John came to them, saying, &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what: if you&#8217;ll give up trying to be such saints, I&#8217;ll give up plaguing you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob and Daisy could not agree to that. So day by day their trials increased. But still these little children of the kingdom struggled patiently on, and in the Book they studied to learn their Father&#8217;s command, they also often found his beautiful promises, and this was one:</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;As one whom his <i>mother</i> comforteth, so will I comfort you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+66%3A13" title="Isaiah 66:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 66:13)</span></a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Bob!&#8221; said little orphan Daisy, &#8220;how sweet it is to be children of the kingdom!&#8221;</p>

<h1>The King&#8217;s Army</h1>

<p class="author">Author Unknown</p>

<p>In the chill December air, Bob and Daisy were again wending their way home from church. The sweet voices of the village choir came floating on the wind, &#8220;Am I a soldier of the cross,&#8221; and in Bob and Daisy&#8217;s hearts were still ringing the words of the text,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I have fought a good fight&#8230;&#8203;I have kept the faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+4%3A7-8" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 4:7-8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 4:7-8)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>&#8220;Daisy,&#8221; said Bob, suddenly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I fight enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>can</i> you mean, Bob?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I think I take things too easy. When John provokes me (and Aunt Skinner always takes his part), I think it&#8217;s enough if I don&#8217;t say a word, or don&#8217;t strike him, when I&#8217;m just longing to do it. Oh, Daisy, if you only knew how angry I feel all the time. Sometimes I have to run out to the woodshed, and saw wood just as fast as I can, and sometimes I get the hammer and nails, and pound on the new chicken-yard just as if it was John&#8217;s head, and I just let all sorts of wicked thoughts run on, and don&#8217;t try to stop them. Now, if I&#8217;m in the King&#8217;s army, that the good old minister told about, I ought not to run away so like a coward. I ought to stand firm, and fight down all these wicked feelings&#8212;come out like a man into the front ranks, and stand the fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; sighed Daisy, &#8220;what do you think of me? I don&#8217;t know how to fight. Oh, Bob, must all the children of the kingdom be in the King&#8217;s army?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose they must,&#8221; said Bob, half laughing; &#8220;but then you, dear Daisy, don&#8217;t you remember what the minister said, that some had more fighting to do than others? Each one must do something, but there must always be someone to look after the baggage&#8212;&#8216;bear one another&#8217;s burdens,&#8217; you know&#8212;and then someone must carry the <i>banners.</i> Now I think you&#8217;d make a capital flag-bearer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you mean, Bob? Could anyone see my flag?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes; you must be so gentle, and forgiving, and patient, and loving, that when anyone looks at you, they will read something as plain as print on a banner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Daisy, with sparkling eyes, &#8220;what banner shall I carry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what <i>I</i> read,&#8221; said Bob, looking at her affectionately: &#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<p>Daisy colored painfully. &#8220;Oh Bob, don&#8217;t make fun of me; I&#8217;m so bad, no one would ever think of <i>that.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure,&#8221; cried Bob, kissing her round, dimpled cheeks.</p>

<p>They opened the garden gate, and, walking up to the stoop, paused a moment to look over the broad fields of snow, rosy in the light of the setting sun. Bob&#8217;s heart was full of gentle and brave resolutions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what, Daisy&#8212;you shall carry the banners, and make the music, and I&#8217;ll try to be a real faithful soldier, and&#8212;</p>

<p>His remarks were cut short by a very unexpected shower of icy water from the windows above.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a little too much,&#8221; cried Bob, angrily, &#8220;over our Sunday clothes, and your best bonnet; Daisy, I&#8217;ll&#8212;</p>

<p><i>Take care,</i> whispered a voice in Bob&#8217;s ear. <i>Is this the way you &#8220;stand fire&#8221;?</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; cried John&#8217;s voice above, in an affected tone of surprise and concern. &#8220;Who would have thought of your being down there? Dear pilgrims, with your new clothes just fresh from Vanity Fair! And that beautiful pink bonnet! How well it is that <i>Sister</i> Saybrook never took any pride in it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Daisy bit her lip, for she remembered looking in the glass that very morning, and feeling quite pleased with the pretty pink reflection on her cheeks. She also remembered feeling very uncomfortable at hearing John singing in the hall, in his disagreeable nasal tone,</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Why should our garments, made to hide<br />Our sin and shame, provoke our pride?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll be able to forgive me,&#8221; whined John.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, certainly,&#8221; replied Bob, who had quite recovered himself.</p>

<p>Now this was not at all what John wanted. He was greatly disappointed in not seeing Bob fly in a passion. So he called again, &#8220;Oh, you precious hypocrite, to tell the truth, I did it on purpose.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_1/04_door.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="419" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; cried Daisy&#8217;s cheery voice, as they hurried in to repair damages. &#8220;We forgive you just the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was too much for John, and he did not show himself again till tea time.</p>

<p>The next morning, as Bob came out of his room, he found chalked in huge letters on his door, &#8220;Saint&#8217;s Rest,&#8221; but he, smiling, wiped it off, and took no further notice of the intended taunt.</p>

<p>So the winter passed on with daily conflicts, but also some grand victories. To be sure, the young soldiers would often be very weary, and greatly discouraged, but they were never entirely conquered, and, sure of receiving fresh strength from above, they were always ready to come bravely back to the battle. And Daisy carried some very beautiful banners.</p>

<p>Towards spring there was to be a grand examination in the village school, and some rich gentleman had offered two very handsome prizes&#8212;one for the best scholar in mathematics, and one for the best composition. Now John, who was very ambitious, and a boy of good talents, was determined to have them both. In mathematics, Bob, Fred Gray, and he, had already distanced all other competitors, and it was hard to say which would be the victor. But one day John failed utterly in the demonstration of a difficult problem, which was successfully worked out by Bob. This was more than John&#8217;s spirit could bear, and for several days he went around with such an air of sullen gloom, that no one dared to sympathize with him. At last he suddenly betook himself with such energy to his composition, in which there was good prospect of success, that Bob believed his mortification was forgotten.</p>

<p>Every thing went on smoothly till the day before examination, when Bob came hurrying in after school, saying, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve so much to study. Don&#8217;t call me to tea, please, Aunt Skinner; I couldn&#8217;t eat a morsel;&#8221; and he sat himself down in a western window, to improve the last ray of light. Suddenly he uttered an exclamation of dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; cried Daisy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, someone has torn the leaves out of my Algebra, right in the hardest part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you lay it to someone else?&#8221; said Aunt Skinner, sharply. &#8220;You&#8217;ve probably been careless yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I kept it just like a new book,&#8221; said Bob, mournfully. &#8220;Oh, John, won&#8217;t you let me take yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By and by,&#8221; said John; but, though Bob begged and pleaded, he would not stir to find it till after tea. Then he came down stairs, saying, with a yawn, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry, Bob, but I just remember I lent mine to one of the boys yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob looked intensely disappointed, and, seizing his cap, rushed to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; asked Uncle Skinner, coming in with his coat dripping, and using all his force to shut the door against the driving wind. &#8220;It&#8217;s a terrible storm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind it,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;I <i>must</i> try and find an Algebra.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you crazy, child?&#8221; cried Aunt Skinner. &#8220;You shan&#8217;t stir a step. Do you think I can have you on my hands with fever and argue, all through the spring?&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_1/04_sigh.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="333" /></div>
<p>Bob came back in the room very quietly, and leaning his head on his hand, spoke not a word for more than an hour. Neither did little Daisy, who knelt beside him with her head on his knee. At last he turned to her with a very pale face, but a sweet, wan smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all over now, Daisy. It has been a great fight, and I&#8217;m very tired, but I&#8217;m not angry with anyone, now. I&#8217;m pretty sure I shall lose the prize, but perhaps I should have been too proud.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daisy only sobbed softly to herself.</p>

<p>John broke in fretfully, &#8220;Mr. Brooks said my composition would stand a good chance, if it were only a little fuller upon this one head. He said I&#8217;d find a great deal to help me in a book he told me about, but I can&#8217;t get it at <i>this</i> bookstore, and I suppose the roads will be perfectly impassable over to Snowdon tomorrow. What shall I do? I could alter this one sheet at the last minute, if I only had the book.&#8221;</p>

<p>No one answered, and he, grumbling, again applied himself to his task.</p>

<p>Poor Bob was up the next morning with the first streak of light. He secured an Algebra, and never before did a brain travel at such express speed over the difficult problems and equations. But the class was called so soon, he was not more than half ready. Poor Bob! He passed a fine examination, and had many compliments, but he missed <i>once</i> in that very hard place, and the beautiful prize went to Fred Gray.</p>

<p>As the boys walked silently home from school, Bob turned off at the little bridge over the creek. &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel quite well, John,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and I believe a walk would do me good. Please tell Aunt Skinner that I don&#8217;t care for any dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your pride&#8217;s hurt, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; cried John. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to show yourself, after being so badly beaten. Well, it <i>must</i> go down rather hard after all your superior airs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I forgive you, John,&#8221; cried Bob, throwing back a bright look, as he dashed into the wood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me? What for?&#8221; screamed John, stamping his foot. &#8220;Do you think <i>I</i> tore your book?&#8221; But Bob had sprung out of hearing. &#8220;Well, it would be a pity to let such lovely Christian charity die for want of exercise,&#8221; muttered John, and he loosened one of the boards of the little bridge, so that when Bob came bounding back it would tilt up and give him a heavy fall.</p>

<p>But John&#8217;s conscience troubled him all the afternoon, and he could not even think of the composition which was to come off with such glory on the next day. As soon as the late school was dismissed, he almost flew down to the little bridge. Ah! His fears were too true! There, at full length, in the dim, gray light lay the motionless form of his cousin Bob. He had struck his head in falling, and was quite unconscious.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done it at last,&#8221; groaned John, in conscience-stricken despair. &#8220;I&#8217;ve killed him now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lifted him tenderly, for Bob&#8217;s slight figure was a light burden, and carried him home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob has fallen and killed himself!&#8221; he screamed, as Aunt Skinner came to the door.</p>

<p>Then all was hurry and confusion. The doctor came, and old nurse Comfort, and poor little Daisy never ceased to sob and kiss Bob&#8217;s pale hands. John, too, could not keep away, and as he hovered near, he saw a little medal on a long black cord fall from his bosom. He took it up. On one side was scratched, in Bob&#8217;s plain hand, &#8220;Robert Saybrook, entered the King&#8217;s army Dec. 10th, 18&#8212;,&#8221; and on the other, &#8220;My Father&#8217;s promise:
<span class="scripture">&#8216;Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+2%3A10" title="Revelation 2:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 2:10)</span></a></span>&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<p>John shuddered, and for the first time in his life he prayed earnestly, &#8220;Not <i>yet,</i> O God! Keep it for him a little longer. Spare him <i>this</i> time.&#8221;</p>

<p>But John&#8217;s cup of remorse was not yet full for, carrying Bob&#8217;s coat in the hall, a heavy book fell out. John picked it up. It was the very one he had been wishing for, and in it was written, &#8220;John Skinner, with the love of his cousin Bob.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>That</i> is where he went then,&#8221; groaned John. &#8220;Poor, tired, disappointed Bob went way over to Snowdon for <i>me.</i> Oh, he&#8217;ll die; I know he&#8217;ll die! I&#8217;ve killed him!&#8221;</p>

<p>He went to his room, and threw himself on his bed in agony. The long hours passed on, and at last someone knocked at his door. &#8220;Is it all over?&#8221; said John, in a low, fearful whisper. &#8220;Is he dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; answered the pleasant voice of nurse Comfort. &#8220;Your cousin will live, and I thought you would like to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>No words can describe the happiness that thrilled poor John Skinner&#8217;s grateful heart. Neither can it be told with what tenderness he waited on Bob through all his weary confinement. And at last, when the boy was able to bear it, he made a long confession of all his wicked and malicious deeds, and humbly asked for forgiveness. &#8220;For you see,&#8221; said John, in a faltering voice, &#8220;you have been such a good soldier, you have not only conquered yourself, but even <i>me,</i> your greatest enemy, and now I want you and Daisy to tell me how to join the King&#8217;s army, for I, too, am determined to fight the good fight. Oh, Bob, if you could only know how I thank you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t thank <i>me,</i>&#8221; faltered Bob; but could say no more for the happy tears. But as Daisy looked at his radiant face, she whispered, &#8220;I know what banner you are carrying today.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked Bob.</p>

<p>Daisy clasped her fair hands reverently: &#8220;

<h1>Lucy and Her Little Sunbeam</h1>

<p class="author">A. S. K.</p>

<p>Lucy sat, one afternoon, watching her sick mother. The room was very still and dark. The shutters were closed, and the curtains half-drawn; for sick people, you know, cannot bear the strong light.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_1/05_bed.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="204" /></div>
<p>The poor child was very tired and weary, and her little face, that was generally so bright, looked now as though it were in a long shadow. She had been reading aloud for more than an hour to her mother, until at last her head began to be quite tired, and her eyes very heavy. She was sitting in her low chair, by the bedside, and as she watched the long shadows on the floor, some sad thoughts came into her head. &#8220;How I wish that poor, dear mother was well again, as she used to be,&#8221; thought Lucy. &#8220;It seems <i>so</i> long since she was able to go out of doors, or even to sit by the window in the sunshine! I do wonder if it will always be just so! I&#8217;m sure it must be very tiresome here for her. And then&#8212;oh, dear! I am not half so good and patient as I ought to be; I get cross so often, and I&#8217;m afraid I am not a bit of a comfort to Mother, though I am her only little girl!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Lucy heaved a long sigh, and let her head fall wearily on the bedside. That dark room, with its four walls, seemed like a very gloomy world to her, and she forgot how <i>many</i> things there were to make her bright and happy. I don&#8217;t know what else Lucy might have thought, but, all of a sudden, her head started up, and with a very bright voice, she exclaimed: &#8220;Oh, Mother dear! Just see that beautiful streak of sunlight coming in through the blind. There! It has flown across the floor, and is trying to hide itself under your pillow!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her mother looked up with a sweet, quiet smile, and Lucy thought the sunbeam was looking out of her very eyes, as she answered: &#8220;Yes, Lucy, it is very beautiful. It does me good to look at it. You are out in the merry sunshine every day, and can hardly tell what a dear little messenger this stray sunbeam is to <i>me,</i> in this dark room! It makes me thank God, my child, for all His goodness to me. Do you know, Lucy, that <i>you</i> are my own little sunbeam? How could I do without you!&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_1/05_sunbeam.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="247" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother!&#8221; and Lucy&#8217;s head sank lower than ever. &#8220;I wish I <i>could</i> be your sunbeam! I was thinking only just now, how dull it was for you here, and how I wished I could make it brighter and pleasanter for you! Don&#8217;t you get tired of me sometimes, Mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucy, my child, you are my dear little comfort&#8212;my own precious daughter&#8212;and I want to tell you how much you have helped to make me happy and cheerful all the time I have been sick. I thank God every day for having given you to me. And Lucy, when He takes me home to Himself, you must try to be a comfort to others, just as you have been to me. Ask God to keep a bright spot in your heart; to put the sunshine of His own smile there; and then, however dark and sad things may seem about you, you will be happy and useful, and perhaps a stray sunbeam may get into somebody else&#8217;s heart from yours!&#8221;</p>

<p>Neither Lucy nor her mother said any more just then; and Lucy looked towards the window where she had first seen the light shining in. &#8220;It was only one little bit of a ray,&#8221; thought she, &#8220;but it made the whole room look different. It seemed like a bright thought coming in all of a sudden, to keep me company. Well! I <i>will</i> try to be a sunbeam myself; I never thought of it before. I am sure I <i>can</i> be more like one, if I try. I am afraid I often wear a cloudy face instead of a sunny one. God must love the sunshine, for He made it; and the little Bible-verse I learned the other day, says,
<span class="scripture">&#8216;God is light.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1%3A5" title="I&nbsp;John 1:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 1:5)</span></a></span>
I will think of that when I begin to feel selfish and cross, and perhaps it will keep the sunshine in my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so Lucy did try, day after day, at home and at school, to be like the sunbeam. Sometimes it was quite easy, and then again it was <i>very</i> hard; and there would be a fight between the clouds and the sun; and sometimes, I am afraid, the clouds <i>did</i> get the victory. But Lucy was in real earnest, and kept asking God to help her, and to put His light in her heart. And so, although she did not know it, she grew more and more like the sunbeam, and carried light with her wherever she went. She only knew that she felt very happy, and so she tried to make others happy too. She had such a bright smile, and such a cheerful voice, that people were really ashamed to be dull or gloomy when she was near.</p>

<p>One day, not very long after the time when Lucy saw the little sunbeam come in at the window, she stood in her mother&#8217;s room, by the same bedside, but her face was very pale and sorrowful. She knew that her dear mother had left her, and as she looked for the last time on her sweet face, so peaceful and still, she thought how God had taken her mother to be with Him in the land of glory. And Lucy knelt down, and prayed that God would make her fit for heaven, so that she too might be glad when the angel of death came to take her home. When she rose from her knees, the sunlight was streaming softly in at the western window, and Lucy&#8217;s heart was light and happy, for she remembered how Jesus is called the &#8220;Sun of Righteousness,&#8221; and she felt sure that He would shine into her lonely little heart, and fill it with His love!</p>

<h1>Little Red Cloak</h1>

<p class="author">Harriet Burn McKeever</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_1/06_window.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="235" /></div>
<p>Here is Alice standing by the parlor window after tea, looking out upon the winter night.</p>

<p>There is a high wind, and it has been snowing through the day. It is a cold, cheerless night, and the foot-passengers are hurrying along the dreary streets. The flickering gaslight reveals the form of a poor match-girl, who, weak, hungry and cold, has fallen under the lamp, with her basket of matches by her side.</p>

<p>Out runs little Alice with her red cloak on. The child is moaning with pain and suffering, but, with the aid of the cook, the shivering child is brought into the warm kitchen and laid on a settee near the fire.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_1/06_girl.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="216" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it a pity, Nancy?&#8221; said Alice. &#8220;Just see how old her clothes are; she has only one thin petticoat and this ragged dress. I know that we have something to spare,&#8221; and away ran &#8220;Little Red Cloak&#8221; to seek out mamma.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mamma! just come down to the kitchen,&#8221; said the child. &#8220;There is such a poor little girl there, so cold and hungry. Haven&#8217;t we something to give her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go and look, Alice. I think we have an old cloak and a warm dress and skirt. But run back again, my dear, and tell Nancy to give her a good supper; I will soon follow you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The kind-hearted cook had not waited for orders, for when Alice returned the child was sitting by the kitchen-table and eating heartily what Nancy had prepared.</p>

<p>Didn&#8217;t the brown eyes sparkle at the sight? Alice seated herself where she could enjoy the pleasant picture, and in a little while Mrs. Murray entered, with a bundle of good warm clothing hanging on her arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor child!&#8221; said the good lady, as she turned up the old ragged dress and saw the threadbare petticoat and bare legs of the little girl.</p>

<p>In a few minutes a pair of good stockings, some comfortable shoes and warm winter garments replaced the threadbare rags, and the match-girl&#8217;s eyes filled with glad tears as she said, &#8220;Thank you! dear good lady. We are so poor. Mother has been sick all winter and father didn&#8217;t do right. He has had no work for a whole year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you live, little girl?&#8221; asked Mrs. Murray.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Taylor&#8217;s court, ma&#8217;am. Last year we had some nice things in our house&#8212;a good table and some chairs, a bedstead and warm bed, and some bed clothes; but they are all gone now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have they gone to?&#8221; inquired the listener.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father sold them. Then mother got sick and couldn&#8217;t work any more, and I sell matches to get something to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Murray took the directions and promised to call upon them and see what could be done.</p>

<p>Little Peggy was a thankful child when she bade goodnight, for she carried home a basket of good food, with some money to buy a little coal, and, better than all, the feeling that they had found a friend.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_1/06_going.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="296" /></div>
<p>The next day was a bright cold day, and Mrs. Murray, with &#8220;Little Red Cloak,&#8221; started for Taylor&#8217;s court.</p>

<p>Peggy&#8217;s story was all true.</p>

<p>It was a sight of misery. A poor, sick woman in the corner, on a bundle of old rags, with nothing but a worn-out cloak to cover her, a drunken man by the stove fast asleep, and little Peggy getting something ready for her mother to eat.</p>

<p>Mrs. Murray took the case in hand, had the wretched man sent to the alms-house, provided a physician from the dispensary, and then sent a bedstead, with warm bed-clothes and whatever was necessary for the comfort of the poor woman. Kindness and proper food soon restored the sufferer, and as soon as she was well enough Mrs. Murray got for the mother a good place in a respectable family, whilst she took little Peggy into her own family, to learn to be a waiter. Thus Peggy was cared for, and also removed from the bad influences of her home.</p>

<p>Alice always felt as if Peggy belonged very much to her, and the little warm-hearted Irish girl in return looked upon the child as one sent by heaven to save her mother and herself from starving.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant sight to watch the love between the two. If any delicacy fell to Peggy&#8217;s lot, away she would run to Miss Alice with the nice ripe peach, the red-cheeked apple, or juicy pear.</p>

<p>&#8220;And sure it isn&#8217;t for the likes o&#8217; me,&#8221; the little girl would say; &#8220;I niver was used to no sich things, and it&#8217;s jest the thing for your pretty little mouth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have had quite enough, Peggy, and mamma likes you to have a share always.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, Miss, that you&#8217;re often hungry when you come in from school. Jest take it, honey, to please little Peggy. I would a heap rather see you have it than eat it myself,&#8221; and the child would run off laughing, leaving the gift of love behind.</p>

<p>Alice would not eat the fruit, but many a time would she return the same to Nancy, telling her to bring it out as her own gift to little Peggy.</p>

<p>Every Saturday the mother came to look after her child, and Alice Murray was very happy when she saw the cheerful, neatly-clad woman, with such a healthy look, and little Peggy smiling by her side. Alice had not forgotten the cold night when she brought in the little girl from the winter storm, or the miserable home where they had found the two.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_1/06_teaching.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="201" /></div>
<p>Peggy was very ignorant, for their poverty had kept her away from school, and so Alice thought that she must teach her little girl. Accordingly, every evening after tea, the two are seen around the kitchen-table, Alice with her schoolbooks, and Peggy, with her bright Irish face, listening to her kind, young teacher. After the lessons were over, nothing delighted Peggy so much as the pretty stories that Miss Alice read from her Sunday-school books.</p>

<p>Sweet spirit of love! A little drop of the same that brought Jesus from the skies to bless and save a world of sinners. The dewdrops fell all unconsciously from the lips of little Alice, and found their way into the heart of Peggy, the match-girl.</p>

<p>Goodbye, Peggy; we leave you to the care of the &#8220;Little Red Cloak.&#8221; God lead you both from the parlor and the kitchen safely home to the better land!</p>

<p>No wonder that Alice Murray is a blithe singing bird, with a heart so full of love and a life so full of kind actions. She loves to think of Jesus and to study the sweet chapters that tell about his patience, his tenderness and love. She thinks of Him the first thing in the morning and the last at night. Alice has other pleasant thoughts, but this is the one great idea that swallows up all the rest. Some are like the little stars, but Jesus is the bright sun of Alice Murray&#8217;s young heart.</p>

<h1>Helen&#8217;s Difficulty</h1>

<p class="author">Annie E. S. Beard</p>

<p>Helen Preston was reading the parable of the pounds from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+19%3A11-27">Luke 19</a>.
When she had reached the end, she sat back in her little rocking chair with a very sober face. Presently Aunt Emma came in, and, seeing the small figure in the chair, said, &#8220;Why, Helen, what&#8217;s the matter? You look puzzled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I am, Auntie. Why didn&#8217;t he praise the man for taking good care of his one pound? If he didn&#8217;t want to use it, why wasn&#8217;t he right to keep it carefully until the owner&#8217;s return?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Vernon came and sat down by her little niece, and after a moment&#8217;s thought, said, &#8220;What was the command given to each man as he received the pounds?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen glanced down at the open Bible in her lap, and after a little hesitation, replied, &#8220; <span class="scripture">&#8216;Occupy till I come.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+19%3A13" title="Luke 19:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 19:13)</span></a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and when their lord returned he called them all to him, that he might know how much they had gained by trading. Evidently, then, they were suppose to make good use of those pounds. They were to be used in such way as would make it most profitable to the owner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen&#8217;s face brightened. &#8220;Now I understand it. I thought they were only to take care of the pounds until his return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you read these parables you must remember they are picture-lessons&#8212;stories with meanings to them, and the things Jesus wanted to teach the people were more important than the real facts in the story. Do you know what is the meaning of this parable?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen always liked Auntie&#8217;s questions. Now she said eagerly, &#8220;Oh, yes; this was our Sunday-school lesson not long ago. Teacher said it was to show us how God expected a right use of the things he has given us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What things, Helen?&#8221; questioned Auntie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time, and&#8212;and the being able to do things&#8212;&#8221; Helen hesitated; it wasn&#8217;t easy to put into words, though she knew what it meant&#8212;&#8220;you know, Auntie, it may be little things or big things, our hands or our feet, our thoughts, our tongues, and ever so many others.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Emma smiled. &#8220;Yes, dear, whatever God has given us the power to do ought to be done rightly and well, so as to please and honor Him. To let that power lie idle&#8212;to do nothing when we might do something&#8212;is being unfaithful to Him who has trusted us with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like the man with the one pound.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so; Jesus wanted to teach us that neglect to use what he has given us to make good use of is sin. Suppose, Helen, it was grain, instead of money, that this man gave to his servants. All but one sowed it in the proper season, and when harvest time came they had a much larger amount of grain than at the first, because they had made good use of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did the one man do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He carefully put the grain away in a sack in the barn, and when after some years the owner claimed it, he brought it out, and lo! it was all mildewed and dried up, of no use at all. So you see the very keeping of some things wastes and spoils them, while the using of them increases their value. We often think that we only sin when we do wrong, but Jesus tells us that we sin when we fail to do right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I never thought of it that way, Aunt Emma,&#8221; said Helen, with a very sober look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not, dearie, but don&#8217;t forget it in the future. To waste time or anything else God has given us, or to spend it foolishly or uselessly, is as wrong as to use it for evil purposes. Try, little Helen, to make a good use of your life and everything in it, that at the end God may say to you also,
<span class="scripture">&#8216;Well done, good and faithful servant.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+25%3A23" title="Matthew 25:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 25:23)</span></a></span>&#8221;

<h1>&#8220;Tenderhearted, Forgiving One Another&#8221;</h1>

<p class="author">Author Unknown</p>

<p>In the sweet June twilight, Willy Carter came slowly through the clover-scented fields, carrying, very carefully, a little willow basket, with the cover tied fast. A very satisfied smile was tugging at the corners of Willy&#8217;s red mouth, and happy thoughts were dancing like fire-flies in the twilight of his great gray eyes. It was so pleasant walking there so quietly, with the red sunset still burning in the west, and the birds crooning so sleepily from the trees. And then when, once in a while, he took a delighted peep through the crevices of the basket, how could he help smiling more and more?</p>

<p>But suddenly, as he lifted his eyes, he saw Jack Dawkins standing by the gate at the end of the meadow. Now Willy was quite afraid of Jack, who was a rather mischievous boy, loving to tease his companions, and so he turned quietly to go in another direction.</p>

<p>But Jack saw the intention, and called loudly, &#8220;Here, Will Carter, you little blockhead, where are you going so fast, and what have you got in your basket?&#8221;</p>

<p>Willy knew it would do no good to run, and so he thought he would just try to be very pleasant and polite, and perhaps he would have no trouble. So he went forward as cheerfully as he could, saying, &#8220;Oh! Jack, what do you think! I have been over to grandmother&#8217;s, and she has given me the most beautiful kitten in the world!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see her,&#8221; said Jack.</p>

<p>Will lifted the cover cautiously, saying, &#8220;She&#8217;s so lively, she&#8217;d be out in a minute, if you didn&#8217;t take care. Now did you ever see such a beauty?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack peered in curiously. &#8220;She is pretty, that&#8217;s a fact&#8212;just as white as snow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t a black hair on her, anywhere,&#8221; cried Will, with enthusiasm; &#8220;and I&#8217;m trying to think what name to give her. Pearl is good, and Snowball, but grandmother called her Lily, and I guess I will, too. Oh! You ought to see her run after a string. She rolls over and over, just like a little ball of wool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will you take for her?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t want to sell her,&#8221; said Will, with great apprehension, sliding the cover over the basket.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you my top.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My kite?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got one of my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; urged Jack, &#8220;what if I should give you my knife with two blades?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Willy, thoughtfully, &#8220;maybe you&#8217;d want it back again; and, any way, I think I&#8217;d rather keep the kitten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a mean, stingy fellow!&#8221; cried Jack, angrily, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve a good mind to take it away from you this minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; pleaded Willy, &#8220;you wouldn&#8217;t like to give me your little dog, Spot, would you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed; I love him as well as I do myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why won&#8217;t you let me keep my kitten?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re such a baby, you don&#8217;t know half the funny things you can do with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me take her a minute, and I&#8217;ll show you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Willy didn&#8217;t dare refuse, and tremblingly handed out his little pet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;in the first place, you can play <i>hand-organ</i> with her. You just take her by the back of the neck, <i>this</i> way, and then take her tail and turn it round and round&#8212;just so. There,&#8221; said he, laughing loudly, &#8220;do you hear the <i>mew</i>-sic?&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor kitten stretched out her little velvet paws, and mewed piteously, while the tears started to Will&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s <i>too</i> cruel, Jack; you will twist her tail off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then she&#8217;ll be better off; for suppose my dog, Spot, chases her, and she runs for some hole, and <i>just</i> has time to squeeze in, won&#8217;t she be a great deal happier if she don&#8217;t have her tail to look after?&#8221; and Jack laughed loudly at this poor attempt at wit.</p>

<p>Poor Will now begged very hard that Jack would put the kitten back in the basket, but all in vain; and he was just ready to despair, when he saw the school-teacher, good Mr. Hope, who was taking his evening walk through the fields. This gentleman, who had heard the latter part of the conversation, now stepped up quickly, and ordered Jack to restore the kitten, while he gave him a severe reprimand for his cruelty. Jack colored with rage and shame, and whispering to Will, &#8220;I&#8217;ll pay you for this, some day,&#8221; he darted across the fields, and Will hastened home to his mother. You may be sure he had a long story to pour into her sympathizing ears; but at last, he finished, saying, &#8220;Now, mother, did you ever know such a hateful boy? I declare, I can&#8217;t bear him; and I almost wish somebody would cut off Spot&#8217;s tail.&#8221;</p>

<p>His mother looked very sad, and said, &#8220;My dear, dear son, you do not know what you are saying. I am afraid our great Father in heaven sees very little difference in the hearts of Willy Carter and Jack Dawkins. I am sure Willy has been a sinful child today. He has been cross, thoughtless, disobliging, selfish, and has cherished many unkind thoughts. Oh! How very sad it would be if God should remember my little son&#8217;s morning prayer, &#8216;Forgive us <i>our</i> trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us,&#8217; and should say, &#8216;I will forgive Willy Carter just as <i>he</i> forgives Jack Dawkins.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_1/08_sobbing.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="413" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother!&#8221; said poor Will, with streaming eyes, &#8220;I never thought of that. Do kneel down with me, and ask God to forgive me, and help me to forgive Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they prayed a long time; and when, at last, they rose from their knees, Willy looked as if he were at peace with all the world. Then his mother kissed him, and said, &#8220;I have a little Bible verse which I wish my son to learn and always remember. It is this: <span class="scripture">&#8216;And be ye kind one to another, <i>tenderhearted, forgiving one another,</i> even as God for Christ&#8217;s sake hath forgiven you.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+4%3A32" title="Ephesians 4:32"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 4:32)</span></a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Willy learned it perfectly, and then, before going to bed, went out to find a good place in the barn where Lily might lodge for the night. As he left her nicely curled in the straw, he heard a slight noise, and thought he saw, through a knothole, the envious eyes of Jack Dawkins. But they were gone in a minute, and he concluded it was a mistake.</p>

<p>The next morning he rose early, and ran out to have a scamper with Lily before breakfast; but, to his surprise, she was not in the barn. A hasty search through the garden and kitchen was equally unsuccessful; and so he ran very swiftly across the fields to grandmother&#8217;s, to see if the kitten had grown homesick and run back to her brothers and sisters. But no, she had not been seen since they squeezed her little white back under the cover of Willy&#8217;s basket. Poor Willy came back slowly and heavily, had no appetite for his breakfast, and sat down to his lessons with a very sad heart.</p>

<p>In the afternoon a small box was left at the door for Will. The little boy tore off the wrapper, and read, printed on the box in straggling letters, &#8220;A <i>pond</i> Lily for <i>Miss</i> Willy Carter.&#8221; He opened the box with a queer choking in his throat, and a vague suspicion that all was not right; and there, indeed, lay his little white kitten, with filmy eyes, draggled, dripping, <i>drowned!</i> Willy gave one look, and threw himself, sobbing, into his mother&#8217;s arms. He could not speak for a long time; but at last exclaimed, passionately, &#8220;Oh, Jack, Jack! How could you be so cruel? It&#8217;s too mean, <i>too</i> mean!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220; <span class="scripture">&#8216;Tenderhearted,&#8217;</span>&nbsp;&#8221; whispered his mother, &#8220; <span class="scripture">&#8216;forgiving one another.&#8217;</span>&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t <i>now,</i>&#8221; sobbed Will, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll try by and by.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he <i>did</i> try very hard, and, going to his own little room, he prayed so earnestly for help, that God gave him a &#8220;tender heart,&#8221; and took away all anger and desire of revenge.</p>

<p>That night, as Will stood sadly in the garden, over the spot where he had buried his kitten, he heard a sudden cry of &#8220;Fire!&#8221; Soon men came hurrying past, and little Will, carried away by excitement, joined them. &#8220;Where is it?&#8221; cried one. &#8220;Neighbor Dawkins&#8217; barn, and he away at town,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>It was almost dark, and Will stood gazing at the flames, with mingled fear and delight, when he heard the melancholy howl of a dog, and it flashed across his mind that poor Spot was chained in the barn, and Jack had gone off with his father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! How terribly Jack will feel to have Spot burnt up!&#8221; thought Will. &#8220;I wonder where the poor dog is.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ran hastily around the other side of the barn, and caught a glimpse of Spot, jumping furiously the length of his chain, and then giving a long, despairing howl. The sympathy in Will&#8217;s great, big heart drove out every thought of fear, and, seeing that that part of the barn was not yet in flames, he sprang through an opening, into the midst of the smoke, unchained the trembling little Spot, and escaped safely into the open air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, boy, are you crazy?&#8221; cried the stout fireman, catching him up. &#8220;It was only a dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I could not bear to see him burn up; and then Jack <i>loves</i> him so dearly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then Jack came rushing up. &#8220;Where&#8217;s Spot?&#8221; he cried, in a trembling voice. &#8220;Did nobody unchain Spot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said a man, &#8220;<i>this</i> little fellow periled his life to save him for you. He must think a heap of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack turned crimson, and took the dog without a word, while Willy ran home.</p>

<p>An hour afterwards, as Willy still lingered upon the patio, talking with his mother, Jack came suddenly running up the walk, and threw his arms around his neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear, good Will,&#8221; he sobbed, &#8220;can you <i>ever</i> forgive me? See, I have brought you Spot. He is more yours than mine. Oh, will you be my friend, and help me to be a better boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve forgiven you long ago, Jack,&#8221; said little Will, giving him a kiss of peace; &#8220;but I do not want Spot. I could never feel happy to take your own little dog you have loved so long.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Jack could hardly be comforted, till Willy&#8217;s mother, taking his hand, talked kindly to him a long time, and taught him Willy&#8217;s sweet verse. Jack went home that night with some new thoughts in his head, and he made a firm resolve, with God&#8217;s help, to lead a different life.</p>

<p>The next morning he walked two miles to get another kitten for Will, and I am happy to say that these two boys did become so kind, so tenderhearted, so forgiving, to one another, and to all others, that we have every reason to believe that God, for Christ&#8217;s sake, has fully forgiven them.</p>

<h1>The Garden of the Beloved</h1>

<p class="author">Author Unknown</p>

<p>&#8220;There, now you&#8217;ve done it,&#8221; cried John Cramer to his twin brother, Cornelius, as he arrived breathless at the garden gate. &#8220;You weren&#8217;t fair a bit in that race, and you ran twice right over Phoebe&#8217;s flowerbed, and took the heads off her very best tulips. Oh! won&#8217;t she be mad? And here she comes this very minute to look at them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a fact,&#8221; said Cornelius, &#8220;and I may as well walk right up and &#8216;face the music,&#8217; and have it over with.&#8221; He went slowly up to Phoebe, who was bending in sorrowful surprise over her little tribe of tulips that had been so remorselessly scalped.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_1/09_flowers.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="288" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes, <i>I</i> did it,&#8221; said Cornelius, in dogged response to her look of mute inquiry. &#8220;There now, how angry you are. You pretend to be good, and you&#8217;re not a bit like that girl in the story of &#8216;Good Little Jane.&#8217; <i>She</i> would have said right away, &#8216;Oh, if anyone&#8217;s flowers are spoiled, I hope they are <i>mine,</i>&#8217; and she would have been so glad that they were not her brother&#8217;s, that she would have been happy as a queen. But <i>you</i> are so selfish, I do believe you are going to cry. You ought to have been called <i>April</i>&#8212;it&#8217;s just shower, shower, shower all the time. Yes, here it comes,&#8221; said he, as two white clouds, with heavy fringes, swept down over those little samples of blue sky, commonly called Phoebe&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;April showers!&#8221; continued he, in a tone of great disgust, to John, who drew nigh.</p>

<p>Phoebe spent a moment trying to swallow something, which, from the effort, might have been the whole range of the Alleghany Mountains. Then, looking up with a smile like a rainbow, she said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m sure I didn&#8217;t mean to be selfish, and I am <i>truly</i> glad they are not your flowers, but you know these disappointments come on one sometimes, just like a great cloud, and one can&#8217;t help a little rain.&#8221; She added, good-naturedly, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember the little rhyme, &#8216;April showers bring May flowers?&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you,&#8221; said Cornelius. &#8220;It would be a funny flower-garden that would spring up under those showers. What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t explain it very well,&#8221; said Phoebe, &#8220;but Miss Weston was telling me last Sunday that when any trouble came&#8212;big or little&#8212;it made every thing gloomy like the clouds on a rainy day. But if we took the cloud patiently, and let the rain come down and soften our hearts, after a while flowers would bud and bloom&#8212;fair white flowers&#8212;and the Beloved would come down into his garden to gather lilies.&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_1/09_boy.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="162" /></div>
<p>&#8220;What a terribly mixed-up speech <i>that</i> is,&#8221; said Cornelius, scornfully. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you have the least idea what you are talking about. Lilies and flowers in one&#8217;s heart! What do you mean, you ridiculous goose?&#8221; And John joined in the derisive laugh.</p>

<p>Phoebe answered timidly, &#8220;I do not know that I ought to say it, but now, after this cloud, which has been quite a big one to me, I&#8217;m hoping&#8212;you know I didn&#8217;t get angry, Cornelius, or scold&#8212;so I&#8217;m hoping that there is a little bud of <i>patience</i> in my heart. I won&#8217;t call it a flower yet, but may be it will be some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Phoebe,&#8221; said Cornelius, emphatically, &#8220;you&#8217;re a Pharisee, and Miss Weston&#8217;s a prig! Now, don&#8217;t let me hear any more such nonsense, or I&#8217;ll cut off all your red hair, and give it to the boys to keep their hands warm. Ah! there it goes again. One, two&#8212;oh, what big drops! Never mind, perhaps patience will shove out a new leaf.&#8221; And, with a loud laugh, Cornelius turned a somersault down the garden path, followed by his shadow and echo&#8212;John.</p>

<p>Phoebe turned to the house, her heart so full of bitter thoughts that she couldn&#8217;t feel at all certain about that rare plant she had hoped was beginning to bud. She had felt a very strong impulse to strike Cornelius when he spoke so cruelly about her red hair, and some way she had a queer feeling that the blow had fallen instead upon that small bud, and that if it ever came to any thing it would be a rather scraggly flower.</p>

<p>Phoebe took a turn or two in the garden, and gradually became more composed. This was Saturday&#8212;a holiday&#8212;and it would not do to waste it all in tears. She would go and get the beautiful book Susan Brown lent her, and have a splendid time, reading, all by herself. But as she hurried into the house, her oldest sister, Caroline, called from the parlor, &#8220;Here, Phoebe, take this glove and sew up the rips just as quick as you can. No; you may run up stairs first, and get my crimson shawl, and my handkerchief, and then just run to the basement and get me a glass of water before I go out. There&#8212;that&#8217;s a dear little girl! Oh! Did you bring my parasol? The sun is so hot! No? Oh, well, you&#8217;ll find it in some of my drawers. It won&#8217;t take you a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Up went the patient feet, and back again.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; cried sister Caroline, &#8220;how do I look?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beautiful!&#8221; was the heartfelt response; and the pleased Caroline, kissing her, said, &#8220;Well, <i>you</i> are good, if you are not very pretty,&#8221; and she tripped carelessly from the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;If not very pretty,&#8221; said Phoebe to herself, sadly, and she stole up to the mirror and looked in. A pale, thin, little face, topped with a crown of flaming hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another April shower,&#8221; cried Cornelius at the door, and poor Phoebe turned away very patient, very humble, and the flowers of meekness and gentleness began to open their sweet leaves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I shall have a little time to read,&#8221; thought Phoebe again to herself, and she hurried up stairs to forget her sorrows in the wonderful book; but, alas! the nursery door opened just as she reached the top of the steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Phoebe,&#8221; cried nurse, carrying little sobbing Bobby, &#8220;would you be so very kind as to amuse baby just five minutes? My head aches so, I&#8217;m quite distracted, and if I could only lie down, and bathe it with camphor&#8212;but Bobby is so cross about his teeth, he won&#8217;t be put down a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phoebe gave a long sigh. &#8220;No, Miggs,&#8221; she began, &#8220;I&#8217;m tired myself.&#8221; Oh! How the tender buds of gentleness and love began to droop, and a great weed of selfishness grew faster than a mushroom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Miss,&#8221; said Miggs, kindly, &#8220;I suppose you are. You&#8217;re everybody&#8217;s little slave, that&#8217;s a fact! Never mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; cried Phoebe, falteringly; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean that. I&#8217;ll take him a little while. Come, Bobby&#8221;; and Bobby&#8217;s fretful mouth softened into a smile as he sprang into the arms of his favorite sister.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_1/09_visitor.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="290" /></div>
<p>It was afternoon, and again there seemed a prospect of a little peace. Carry, mother, nurse, and baby were out taking a drive, and John and Cornelius, with their schoolmates, were holding a meeting in the barn.</p>

<p>Phoebe settled herself with her book in the broad window-seat, and all her trials seemed to fade away, but when she had been reading about ten minutes, and was just in the most exciting part of the story, there came a timid knock at the door. She raised her head with a frown, and there&#8212;she could just have cried from vexation&#8212;there stood tedious, old Mrs. Smith. Phoebe felt very rebellious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother and Carry are both out,&#8221; said she, very quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, my dear. I will sit awhile with <i>you.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p><i>This is the biggest cloud yet,</i> said Phoebe bitterly to herself. <i>I thought I had had enough for one day. It is too bad, too bad!</i> But unconscious old Mrs. Smith sat down, and took off her shoes, and laid down her shawl, as if she had come to stay all the rest of the day. Then she began to tell little Phoebe about her last attack of rheumatism, and of the dreadful cough she had nights, how she had frozen her feet last January, and how she had fallen and knocked out one of her front teeth, and how brother John&#8217;s children&#8212;the whole eight of them&#8212;had the measles&#8212;all when poor Phoebe was just dying to read whether Jack Ringtop ever found his way out of the black forest. Phoebe was very rebellious at first, and I am afraid that if the Beloved had then gone down into His garden, He would have found no lilies. But, after a great struggle, she concluded to make the best of this shower, and she answered Mrs. Smith so kindly, and had so much sympathy for all her trials, that the old woman was full of grateful surprise, and going away at last, she laid her withered old hand upon her head, and blessed her in the name of the Lord. And though, almost as soon as she was gone, crying baby came home, and Carry had a dozen errands for the willing hands and feet, still Phoebe felt wonderfully happy, and the buds of long-suffering began to put forth in the showers, while patience really burst into full flower.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_1/09_girl.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="222" /></div>
<p>It was now tea-time, and Phoebe was looking forward with some apprehension to the coming of her ill-natured, teasing brother, when John appeared, breathless, with a white face, and announced that Cornelius had fallen from the hay-loft, and hurt himself very much. The news was indeed too true. Cornelius had broken his leg, and was carried to his room to be a prisoner for weeks. Forgiving Phebe was his nurse from the first, and Cornelius, impatient, and angry with pain and confinement, exhausted his ingenuity in contriving ways to make her trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;You little fright!&#8221; he cried angrily, one night, as she stole in to see if there was any thing more she could do, &#8220;do you want to know what you look like? In the first place, you&#8217;re about as fat as a broomstick, and in that white wrapper you look like a tallow candle with your red hair for the light. Get out of my sight; you&#8217;re horrid! I&#8217;d like to snuff you out.&#8221;</p>

<p>But no sooner had poor Phoebe stolen humbly away, than he called her back to execute a dozen different commands, reproaching her that she wasn&#8217;t more unselfish&#8212;like &#8220;Good little Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a long, cloudy time for Phoebe, and more than an April rain, but the flowers grew fast in the showers. Love, patience, long-suffering, gentleness, meekness, were all there, and Phoebe was far from unhappy, for joy and peace are always found blossoming in the same company.</p>

<p>Cornelius worried himself into a fever, and his life was despaired of, but when, after a long struggle, his strong constitution conquered, and he began slowly to improve, everyone could see that some change had come over him. His eyes had a different look now, as they followed little Phoebe&#8217;s swift, noiseless steps around his room. Such patient, tireless feet! Such an uncomplaining, self-sacrificing sister! How could he have been blind so long? And that red hair, how he loved every golden thread! As she sat by the window at sunset one day, with her little Bible opened before her, it seemed like a saint&#8217;s halo around her sweet face.</p>

<p>&#8220;John,&#8221; whispered the repentant Cornelius, &#8220;I have made a long April for our little sister, but oh, how the flowers have grown! I see it all now, and do you know? I have made a resolve that from this time I will do all I can to make life sunshine to her, for I&#8217;m frightened to see her so good, and I&#8217;m afraid when the May flowers are all in bloom, they will take her where everlasting Spring abides.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_1/09_window.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="379" /></div>
<p>Just then sister Carry entered the room. &#8220;Hush,&#8221; said Cornelius, putting his finger on his lip, and pointing to Phoebe, who still sat, her sweet face upturned, and her lovely eyes looking far away into the rosy sky.</p>

<p>Carry looked, and almost started, as the idea suddenly flashed upon her that little Phoebe was <i>beautiful,</i> far more beautiful than she, with her red cheeks and brown hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> never looked like that, Carry,&#8221; said Cornelius, softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never half so pretty,&#8221; cried echo John.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; said Carry, almost fretfully. &#8220;Phoebe!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush,&#8221; implored Cornelius, &#8220;don&#8217;t trouble her. <i>I</i> will tell you. I understand it all now&#8221;; and the tears rolled down his thin cheeks. &#8220;Don&#8217;t disturb her for the world. Little Phoebe has a beautiful heart, and whenever she looks like <i>that</i> you may know the <span class="scripture">&#8216;beloved is gone down into his garden&#8230;&#8203;to gather lilies.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Song+of+Solomon+6%3A2" title="Song of Solomon 6:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Song of Solomon 6:2)</span></a></span>&#8221;</p>

<h1>Johnny&#8217;s Christmas Present</h1>

<p class="author">M. A. H.</p>

<p>Frank Ripley was going to school one morning, feeling very happy indeed.</p>

<p>One reason was that he knew all his lessons, but the greatest reason of all was that in two days it would be Christmas. He always had a very happy time on that day, because, in the first place, he had plenty of kind friends to make him presents, and then he always went with all his cousins&#8212;and he had a great many&#8212;to his grandfather&#8217;s, to dinner, where they had a grand time.</p>

<p>As he went whistling along, thinking of all these things, he passed a house where a poor woman lived, who sometimes worked for his mother. She was a widow, with only one child, a little boy, who was lame. He was about Frank&#8217;s age, but he was much smaller, and looked so pale and delicate, that he seemed two or three years younger.</p>

<p>On this morning, as Frank passed the house, the little lame boy was at the window, looking so sad and lonely&#8212;for his mother was out at work&#8212;that Frank was almost tempted to stop and talk to him a little while. But it was almost school-time, and he had a long walk still before him; so he had to be satisfied with giving him a smile and a nod, as he hurried past.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Johnny!&#8221; said he to himself as he walked along, &#8220;he must have a very tiresome time, alone all day with no one to speak to him. I wonder if he is glad Christmas is coming? No, I suppose not, for he has no one to give him presents, and no grandfather&#8217;s house to go to.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then what his teacher had said in Sunday school the day before came into his mind: that Jesus came into the world to make everybody happy, and those who wanted to be like Jesus would try to make everybody happy too. And then his teacher said that little children had so many things given them on Christmas day, and so much done to make them happy, that they very often forgot that they ought to make somebody else happy, too. He wanted each of his scholars to try if they could not add to someone else&#8217;s happiness on the next Christmas day.</p>

<p>Frank thought of all this as he walked along, and he tried to think of something that he could do for Johnny. But he had not made up his mind what it should be when he reached the schoolhouse, and then there was so much for him to think about, that he forgot Johnny until he passed the house again on his way home; then he remembered his morning&#8217;s thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what I can give him?&#8221; he thought again. &#8220;I might buy him a sled with that gold piece Uncle Charles gave me, but he couldn&#8217;t use it, nor skates either, nor marbles, nor a kite. He might like a book. I&#8217;ll ask Mother; she&#8217;ll know.&#8221;</p>

<p>But his mother was out when he reached home, so he had to leave the question unsettled, and after putting away his books, he went out to feed his rabbits.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_1/10_basket.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="426" /></div>
<p>Frank loved his rabbits very much, and he used to spend a great deal of time with them, as he had no brothers or sisters to play with. They were very tame, and would run to him when he came near their pen, as if they were very glad to see him.</p>

<p>As he was feeding them, the thought came into his mind, perhaps Johnny would like some rabbits to play with. He could have a pen for them at the side of his mother&#8217;s house, and when he was alone, he could bring them into the house for company. Then Frank began to look among his rabbits&#8212;for he had several&#8212;to see which he could spare the best. But he loved them all, and he could not make any choice. In fact, it would cost him more self-denial to give Johnny two of his rabbits than any thing else. But he could not think of any thing that it seemed to him Johnny would like as well. So when his mother came home he told her his plan. She was very much pleased to have her boy so thoughtful for another&#8217;s happiness, and she was sure Johnny would be delighted.</p>

<p>After Frank decided to give the rabbits, nothing gave him so much pleasure as the thought of making Johnny the present. Early on Christmas morning he went to his rabbit-pen, and chose two pretty little white fellows, and putting them in a basket, with something for them to eat, started for Johnny&#8217;s house. He found him seated at the window, waiting for his breakfast, which his mother was preparing.</p>

<p>His eyes had never sparkled so before as they did when Frank showed him the rabbits, and told him they were for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever see any thing so pretty, Mother?&#8221; said he. &#8220;Now you won&#8217;t feel so sorry to leave me every day, for I shall have these dear little rabbits to keep me company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, Frank,&#8221; said Johnny&#8217;s mother, &#8220;I cannot tell you how much I thank you. I was just telling Johnny how sorry I was that I had no present for him; I had to buy coal last week, and I had no money left. But I could not have bought him any thing so pretty as these little rabbits.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frank went home with a light heart, and though he received many presents, none of them gave him as much pleasure as his gift to Johnny.</p>

<p>The next day he persuaded some of the schoolboys to help him make a pen for Johnny&#8217;s rabbits, out of some boards his father gave him. When school commenced again, and he passed Johnny&#8217;s house every day, Johnny almost always brought the rabbits to the window, to let him see that he was not alone now, and he looked very happy.</p>

<p>This was the way that Frank on that Christmas day joined in the angels&#8217; song: &#8220;Peace on earth, good will toward men.&#8221;</p>

<h1>The Young Conqueror</h1>

<p class="author">Author Unknown</p>

<div class="center"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_1/11_beds.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="168" /></div>
<p>The retiring bell had rung in Mr. Avery&#8217;s large boarding school for boys, and, one by one, like the closing of so many little twinkling eyes, the lights were extinguished, and the old gray house seemed fast asleep. But in one of the rooms, flooded with the light of the full April moon, lay four wakeful boys, engaged in some eager discussion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Hal,&#8221; cried Bill Massey, exultingly, &#8220;I believe I can beat any boy in school in running and jumping. And just feel of these muscles; do you think one of you could stand up a minute, if this arm said &#8216;Go down&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think Hal could,&#8221; responded Bob Wilson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think he&#8217;d have a tough time with me,&#8221; cried Hal Gray&#8217;s cheery voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps so; and we&#8217;ll try it tomorrow. But it&#8217;s a great thing to be strong, and when I&#8217;m a man I shall enter the army. I shall soon be promoted on account of my bravery, boys; and then how I&#8217;ll lead my company on to battle! We&#8217;ll be like Napoleon&#8217;s Old Guard. Nothing shall stand before us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; interrupted Hal, with a shiver, &#8220;don&#8217;t you think any thing of shooting people down, killing them all in a minute? I&#8217;m sure there could be no glory in battle for me, when I heard the dying men groaning on every side, and thought of the poor mothers and sisters watching and waiting for friends they would never see again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear chicken,&#8221; replied Bill, &#8220;of course I could not walk right up to a man and shoot him coolly through the heart. But you see it will be all excitement&#8212;horses and men all mixed in together&#8212;officers shouting and urging one on, while the guns and cannons make roar and noise enough for fifty Fourth of July&#8217;s. Then you know our country&#8217;s enemies will be before us, and you wouldn&#8217;t want them to beat <i>us.</i> No, indeed! So I, for one, should rush in, dealing blows right and left; and, by and by, the battle would be over, and some proud, rich city would be conquered. Then, in a most magnificent carriage, I should ride through the streets, while the crowd hurrahed, and the band played &#8216;See the conquering hero comes!&#8217; What do you think of that, boys?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All very well,&#8221; laughed Hal Gray, &#8220;if, in the first place, you only get promoted, and if, secondly, you are not killed yourself upon the field of battle. Two rather important <i>ifs.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, captains are never killed,&#8221; responded Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to fight in a safer field,&#8221; said Bob Wilson, &#8220;and perhaps I shall have full as much glory, after all. I&#8217;m determined to be <i>wise.</i> There shall not be one difficult study that I will not conquer. I&#8217;ll fight all the knotty problems. I&#8217;ll make all the sciences my slaves. I&#8217;ll lead the languages captive; and then, when Bill is flourishing his sword and gun in the midst of danger, I shall sit quietly in my room, and, with a few strokes of my pen, conquer a nation. Yes, indeed! I intend to be <i>strong,</i> and to <i>conquer,</i> but I shall be what Mr. Avery calls an &#8216;<i>intellectual</i> giant.&#8217; I intend that my name shall be one of the first in the temple of fame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got the best of it, Bob,&#8221; cried Hal&#8217;s clear voice. &#8220;I like your way of fighting, and I think you&#8217;ll stand the best chance of glory, too. I mean to try as hard as you for the prize that Mr. Avery has offered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; said a childish voice, and the pale face of lame Jemmy Packard was raised from his cot. &#8220;I should like to tell you of something else you ought to fight against, and, if you conquer, you will have far greater glory than any you have spoken of yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; said the boys, good-naturedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;
<span class="scripture">&#8216;He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city,&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+16%3A32" title="Proverbs 16:32"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 16:32)</span></a></span>&#8221;
repeated Jemmy, emphatically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you miserable little Puritan! Shut your eyes and go to sleep,&#8221; cried Bill Massey.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Hal, &#8220;fair play. Jem has as good a right to speak as any of us, and he shall tell us all about it. Now, Jemmy,&#8221; continued he, laughing, &#8220;that would be the hardest kind of a fight for me; do tell us what reward we would have, after our uncomfortable struggle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are so many rewards,&#8221; cried lame Jemmy, &#8220;that I hardly know where to begin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Bob Wilson, impatiently, &#8220;you&#8217;ve been sick so long, you&#8217;re always thinking about these things. All you mean now is, that people, if they are good, will go to heaven. But if I should get there some day, there are so many great angels there already, that nobody would take any notice of me. Now <i>I</i> want to occupy a high place, and make my name known.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you have quite the right kind of ambition, Bob,&#8221; said Jemmy, meekly; &#8220;but if you struggle all your life for earthly fame, it will be nothing compared to the glory given to the conquerors in this nobler battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us about it,&#8221; said Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;These are the words of the promise,&#8221; replied Jemmy: &#8220; <span class="scripture">&#8216;To him that <i>overcometh,</i>&#8217;</span>&#8212;you know what kind of enemies, boys&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8216;will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+3%3A21" title="Revelation 3:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 3:21)</span></a></span>; and <span class="scripture">&#8216;I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+3%3A5" title="Revelation 3:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 3:5)</span></a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Bob, isn&#8217;t that a greater throne than any you can reach on earth, and isn&#8217;t that a glorious company to be all listening when the Savior speaks your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would he speak my name, my very name&#8212;Bob Wilson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; said Jemmy, with strong faith. &#8220;At least, everyone in heaven would know who you were, and that you were the Savior&#8217;s friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there any more promises?&#8221; asked Hal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, a great many; you must read about them all. He will give you to
<span class="scripture">&#8216;eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+2%3A7" title="Revelation 2:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 2:7)</span></a></span>
He will give you the
<span class="scripture">&#8216;morning star,&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+2%3A28" title="Revelation 2:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 2:28)</span></a></span>
and you
<span class="scripture">&#8216;shall not be hurt of the second death.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+2%3A11" title="Revelation 2:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 2:11)</span></a></span>
I cannot remember them all, but it&#8217;s a very great reward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe Jemmy is the wisest of us all; don&#8217;t you think so, boys?&#8221; asked Hal.</p>

<p>But there was no reply, and the low, regular breathing from that side of the room proved that they had both fallen asleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Jemmy,&#8221; continued Hal; &#8220;I know you are right. It is just as mother has always taught me; and sometimes I do try to rule my spirit. But I get angry so easily, and when all the blood rushes to my head, and my heart thumps so fast, I have to do just the first thing I think of, and that is sure to be wrong. It isn&#8217;t because I&#8217;m ashamed or afraid to do right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I knew you were not afraid the first night you came, when you kneeled down before us all and said your prayers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Jemmy, when the boys provoke me, I can&#8217;t bear to take it so meekly, and, as the good people say, &#8216;turn the other cheek,&#8217; but I want to defend myself&#8212;show them it won&#8217;t do to plague such a boy as I am. As Bill says, I want to <i>conquer</i> them. I always thought if ever I were an angel, I should want to be one of those who
<span class="scripture">&#8216;excel in <i>strength.</i>&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+103%3A20" title="Psalm 103:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 103:20)</span></a></span>&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Hal,&#8221; said Jemmy, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you have a great many victories to gain before you could be the poorest kind of an angel. It is very easy for such a strong boy as you to have all sorts of triumphs like Bill Massey&#8217;s, but can&#8217;t you see how much nobler and grander it is to conquer one&#8217;s self?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I <i>do</i> see it, and I <i>will</i> try. It will be hard, but I&#8217;ll have no mercy on myself. Down envy! Down pride! Down passion! What beautiful promises to &#8216;him that overcometh!&#8217; Pray for me, Jemmy, that I may be one of the right kind of conquerors, for they <i>are</i> better, far &#8216;better than the mighty!&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>It was a warm morning in the latter part of May, and Hal Gray, on his way to chapel&#8212;arm in arm with lame Jemmy&#8212;met Bill Massey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Puritans,&#8221; said he, with a kind of wicked smile. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be apt to see some fun at prayers this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked both together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! You two boys are always talking about being so good, and &#8216;overcoming,&#8217; and all that; perhaps you&#8217;ll see old Prex overcome this morning, or <i>come over,</i> just as you please to take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harry immediately suspected some trick, and begged Bill not to do any thing to hurt the feelings of kind Mr. Avery. But he could draw nothing further from his mischievous schoolmate, and so went reluctantly on.</p>

<p>As he entered the chapel, he looked hurriedly around. Every thing was in its place, and he felt somewhat reassured. Presently Mr. Avery appeared, and walked, with dignified step, to his chair. Hal watched him, with painful interest; nor were his fears in vain; for, as the worthy man seated himself, the chair suddenly gave way, and he was prostrated on the floor. A few silly boys laughed, but the hot blood rushed to Hal&#8217;s cheeks and brow, especially when he saw that Mr. Avery had so sprained his foot as to be unable to rise without the assistance of an under teacher. The chair was immediately examined, and it was discovered that one of the back legs had been sawed off.</p>

<p>Mr. Avery turned very sternly to the assembled boys, and demanded who had dared perpetrate such a miserable joke.</p>

<p>The most profound silence followed the question, but as Mr. Avery&#8217;s keen eye swept round the room, it rested on the embarrassed face of Hal Gray.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do <i>you</i> know about it, sir?&#8221; he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>The crimson grew deeper upon Hal&#8217;s cheeks; but he drew himself up a little proudly, as he firmly replied, &#8220;I did <i>not</i> do it, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know who did?&#8221; persisted Mr. Avery.</p>

<p>Harry hesitated, and at last said, faintly, &#8220;I would rather not answer, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I command you. Come, I am waiting for the name,&#8221; said Mr. Avery, with growing impatience.</p>

<p>Harry hesitated, and a low murmur of disapprobation ran through the ranks of boys, most of whom had imbibed that false idea of honor which makes it very contemptible to inform against a schoolfellow, no matter how deeply he is to blame. Harry had a vague idea that such a cowardly act ought to be punished, but it was <i>so</i> hard to speak; besides, what <i>proof</i> had he, after all, that Bill Massey was the rogue?</p>

<p>&#8220;Please excuse me, sir,&#8221; pleaded Hal; &#8220;I cannot tell that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Cannot?</i> And why?&#8221; cried Mr. Avery, a little angrily. But poor Hal could only repeat, &#8220;Please excuse me, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Mr. Avery, thoroughly vexed at what he called Hal&#8217;s obstinacy, while the growing pain in his foot tended to increase an irritability in which he seldom indulged. &#8220;Very well, sir; if you have nothing further to say, we may reasonably conclude that you are the guilty one yourself, and will proceed to award your punishment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not do it, Mr. Avery,&#8221; interposed Hal; but that gentleman, with a hastiness he afterwards regretted, proceeded to say, &#8220;Harry Gray is suspended from his classes for one week, and ordered to remain in his room during the hours of recreation for the same length of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lame Jemmy interposed tearfully, &#8220;Will this prevent him from taking the prize at the end of this term, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Mr. Avery, briefly, and proceeded with the same morning exercises.</p>

<p>This last was too great a blow for Hal. He had striven so hard for that prize, and meant so to delight his mother, and now to lose it all in a minute! It was too much, and leaning back in the shadow of the chapel pillar, he with difficulty restrained his tears. And then, too, how hard to have Mr. Avery think so ill of him. Surely Bill would not have the heart to leave him in such disgrace&#8212;he <i>would</i> confess. But no, not a word more was said upon the subject; and presently the boys dispersed to their different class rooms, giving Hal many a look and word of sympathy as they passed, for he was a great favorite in the school.</p>

<p>At the hour for morning exercise, Hal could not resist hurrying down for one minute&#8217;s talk with Bill Massey. &#8220;Bill, Bill,&#8221; he cried, as the boy tried to evade him, &#8220;surely, you do not mean to make me lose the prize. You <i>will</i> tell Mr. Avery, won&#8217;t you? I know he won&#8217;t scold very hard, now it&#8217;s all over; and you know <i>you</i> can&#8217;t get the prize, any way. <i>Won&#8217;t</i> you tell him, Bill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I shall do any thing of the kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t tell him?&#8221; cried Hal, with indignant surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Bill, doggedly.</p>

<p>The bright color leaped into Hal&#8217;s cheeks, and his eyes flashed with anger.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_1/11_pleading.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="303" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, you&#8217;re a mean-spirited fellow, and a coward!&#8221; cried Hal, his fiery temper entirely getting the mastery of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No boy shall call me that,&#8221; said Bill, coolly rolling up his sleeves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; cried Harry, excitedly. &#8220;I&#8217;m ready to fight, if that&#8217;s what you mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hal, <i>dear</i> Hal,&#8221; pleaded lame Jemmy, and his clinging touch was upon the boy&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>Hal&#8217;s eyes softened a little, as he said, &#8220;Go away, please, Jem; I might hurt you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Jemmy clung the tighter. &#8220;Dearest Hal, you are not the right kind of a conqueror now. Oh! think, Hal, &#8216;to him that overcometh,&#8217; the tree of life, the morning star, the paradise of God. Now is the time to fight hard, &#8216;down passion, down revenge.&#8217; Be a conqueror, Hal, but be <i>sure</i> and strike in the right place.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hal&#8217;s anger rapidly cooled as Jem spoke, and at last he threw his arms around his little friend, exclaiming, &#8220;Jemmy, I believe you are my good angel.&#8221; Then turning to Bill, he said, with an effort, &#8220;I am sorry I called you names, but I cannot fight with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill broke into a loud, sneering laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good way to get out of it, you miserable sneak. Why don&#8217;t you say you don&#8217;t <i>dare</i> fight, instead of playing good, and trying to imagine you&#8217;re a martyr just ready to be taken out of a wicked world?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hal was about making an indignant reply, but checked himself just in time, and rushing to his room, threw himself upon his knees, repenting bitterly of this outburst of passion, and humbly asking help for the future. Harry bore the remainder of his week of disgrace with quiet gentleness and patience, and Mr. Avery more than once regretted the severity of his sentence.</p>

<p>A few more weeks passed, and found Hal still fighting the good fight, with his proud, young spirit under firm control.</p>

<p>In the long twilight of a lovely June evening, Hal was walking with Jemmy by the river, watching Bill Massey, as he taught a troop of young boys to swim.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one thing troubling me, Jemmy,&#8221; said Hal, at length. &#8220;I do not think I feel quite right towards Bill Massey yet. I don&#8217;t like to have him near me, and I would rather oblige any boy in school than him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it <i>is</i> hard, but I suppose it is another feeling to overcome. We must pray for strength to fight it down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>do,</i> Jem,&#8221; said Hal, with sweet seriousness, &#8220;and I wish you&#8217;d pray for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not such a bad boy, after all,&#8221; cried Jem, lovingly, looking into Hal&#8217;s clear, honest eyes. &#8220;I believe if there were some great service to be done for Bill this minute, you&#8217;d be the first to offer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure of that,&#8221; returned Hal, laughing.</p>

<p>Just then there was a great commotion among the swimmers, and some little boys on shore cried out, &#8220;Bill Massey is going down! He has the cramp; he will drown!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that is true!&#8221; cried Jem; &#8220;and those little fellows can only keep their own heads above water. Oh, why <i>did</i> he go out so far?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hal did not stop to think twice, but, pulling off coat and boots, plunged into the water, and with swift strokes approached the drowning boy. Bill was a long distance from shore, and it was almost by superhuman efforts that Hal managed to reach him as he was sinking for the last time.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, he has him!&#8221; shouted the little boys. &#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; But Jem&#8217;s anxieties were not over. &#8220;Poor Hal is so tired,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;how will he tow in that heavy Bill Massey?&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_1/11_swimming.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="120" /></div>
<p>Slowly, and with painful effort, carefully keeping the head of his companion above the water, the brave swimmer struck out for the shore. At first he came on gallantly, then his strength seemed to flag, and once or twice both disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if I were only not quite so helpless,&#8221; groaned Jemmy. &#8220;Run, call some of the big boys, quick, or they will both drown!&#8221;</p>

<p>What an endless time it seemed before help came. Ah! There was Hal&#8217;s curly head again, nearer, nearer. &#8220;A few more strokes, dear Hal,&#8221; cried Jem. &#8220;You are almost in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the little boys set up a wild shout, as two or three of the older students arrived just in time to draw the exhausted pair from the water. Part of them then applied themselves to the task of reviving Bill Massey, while the rest crowded around Hal, congratulating him, and warmly shaking his hand. Hal smiled faintly, and tried to thank them; but suddenly he turned deathly pale, a stream of blood gushed from his mouth, and he fell fainting in Bob Wilson&#8217;s arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; cried Jemmy, in terror, as they laid him upon the grass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Call Mr. Avery, and run for a physician,&#8221; cried Bob, giving quick orders to the little boys. Jem, in the mean while, knelt down, and drew the dear head upon his breast. Smoothing back the wet curls, he whispered anxiously, &#8220;How do you feel, darling?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hal opened his eyes, and with his own bright smile, ever mindful of the feelings of others, replied, &#8220;It is nothing; I do not suffer any.&#8221;</p>

<p>But with the exertion of these few words, the life stream gushed forth so violently that the boys turned pale, and looked at each other with a terrible fear.</p>

<p>Presently good Mr. Avery came hurrying down. &#8220;What is this, my dear, dear boy?&#8221; he cried, as he saw his favorite pupil extended, apparently lifeless, before him.</p>

<p>A few hurried words explained the whole matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can be done for him?&#8221; he cried, as the physician made his appearance. &#8220;Dr. Brown, you <i>must</i> save this noble boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor knelt beside him a moment, with a very grave face. &#8220;He has broken a blood-vessel,&#8221; he whispered to Mr. Avery. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid he will live but a few minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do not say that,&#8221; groaned Mr. Avery. &#8220;Make every exertion for his life&#8212;leave no remedy untried.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then Hal opened his eyes, dreamily, and seeing the pale, grave face of his teacher bending over him, he said, anxiously, &#8220;Do you still think I did it, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill Massey broke through the crowd, and, in a tone full of anguish and remorse, cried out, &#8220;Oh, Mr. Avery, if he means the chair, I did it, I did it. Oh, Hal, you must, you must forgive me.&#8221;</p>

<p>A look of satisfaction passed over Hal&#8217;s pale face, and he turned smilingly to Mr. Avery. &#8220;Is it all right now, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my darling child!&#8221; sobbed Mr. Avery, and could say no more.</p>

<p>All remedies were in vain, and the young life ebbed fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, dear Hal?&#8221; wept Jemmy, putting his ear close to those loved lips, to catch an almost inarticulate murmur.</p>

<p>&#8220;The morning star,&#8221; whispered Hal, faintly; &#8220;the tree of life in the midst of the paradise of God!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;
<span class="scripture">&#8216;To him that overcometh,&#8217;</span>
to you, dear Hal; but, ah!&#8221; cried lame Jemmy, with a sudden burst of anguish, &#8220;will you leave <i>me</i> behind, oh, Hal!&#8221;</p>

<p>Harry Gray did not seem to heed those once familiar tones, but, opening his clear eyes once more, he gazed lovingly around the weeping circle, gave one last, bright smile, and the last enemy was destroyed, even Death.</p>

<p>That night, as Bob and Jemmy watched in the room where the young conqueror slept peacefully after the battle of life, the door softly opened, and Bill Massey stole in.</p>

<p>Jemmy half shuddered when he saw him, but the boy was so changed, so pale and broken-hearted, Jemmy could not say a word to reproach him. For a while he mourned and wept bitterly, then, drawing forth a wreath of laurel, he laid it reverently upon Hal&#8217;s soft, bright curls.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a greater conqueror than ever I shall be,&#8221; he sobbed, as he rushed from the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; added Bob, &#8220;and he has won a greater prize than I have ever striven for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I believe,&#8221; cried Jemmy, almost with exultation, as he kissed the fair brow, &#8220;I believe God has made him an angel, <i>excelling</i> in strength.&#8221;</p>

<h1>What a Little Fire Kindled</h1>

<p class="author">Isabella M. Alden</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah,&#8221; said Will Bailey, &#8220;you&#8217;re fooling, Howard Minturn!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As sure as I live, &#8220;I&#8217;m not,&#8221; answered Howard earnestly; &#8220;you can ask our teacher, Mr. Burrows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; inquired Ellis Holbrook, joining the two.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Howard is telling the biggest yarn you ever heard; he says Tip Lewis went to prayer meeting last night and made a prayer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tip Lewis!&#8221; and Ellis Holbrook&#8217;s voice was full, not only of surprise, but scorn; &#8220;I should like to hear him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s true,&#8221; repeated Howard. &#8220;My father told us about it this morning, and he said it was a good prayer, too&#8212;he said, Ellis, that your father couldn&#8217;t keep the tears out of his eyes when he heard him, and Mr. Burrows walked uptown with Father and told him that Tip had changed wonderfully, that he was one of the best boys in school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Will Bailey, &#8220;if Tip Lewis has turned saint, I&#8217;ll give up. Why, he&#8217;s the meanest scamp in town&#8212;my father says he&#8217;s bad enough for anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well now,&#8221; answered Ellis, &#8220;there&#8217;s no use in being stupid enough not to see that what Mr. Burrows says is true. I never saw anyone change as he has in my life, but I&#8217;ll be hanged if I like him as well as I did before he was so awful good; he&#8217;s too nice for anything nowadays.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Especially when he trips <i>you,</i> the minister&#8217;s son, up about twisting the Bible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ellis&#8217;s face glowed, but he was an honest boy. &#8220;He was right enough about that,&#8221; he said promptly; &#8220;my father says it&#8217;s wrong; but if it will do you any good to know it, I haven&#8217;t liked Tip so well since.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_1/12_boys.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="360" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Say, Tip!&#8221; said Will Bailey, hailing him at recess, &#8220;come here and give an account of yourself; they say you turned parson last night. Did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Tip with the greatest good humor, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you speak in meeting?&#8221;</p>

<p>A quiet gravity spread itself over Tip&#8217;s face. &#8220;I prayed in meeting,&#8221; he answered soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! well, what did you pray for? Come, let&#8217;s know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I prayed for <i>you.</i>&#8221; Tip spoke with quiet dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! Now that&#8217;s clever, certainly; much obliged.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Will said no more.</p>

<p>Certainly, the boys had never talked so much about any prayer meeting in their lives as they did about this one. So that was the way it commenced; such a little fire kindled it. Tip didn&#8217;t know it; he never found out; probably never will, until he takes his crown in heaven. From the humble little prayer which Tip had offered sprang the first budding of the great revival which God sent down to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; said Howard Minturn to Ellis on the next Thursday evening, &#8220;let&#8217;s go over to prayer meeting tonight; I really am dreadfully anxious to hear Tip speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Ellis, speaking heartily, more heartily that he often did to Howard, &#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t care in the least to hear him, and I have enough to do without going there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Howard was <i>determined</i> to go, and to find company.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will, let&#8217;s go to meeting tonight,&#8221; he said the next time he came across Will Bailey.</p>

<p>Will looked at him in amazement. &#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To hear Tip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Will, &#8220;good! I&#8217;ll go; let&#8217;s get a lot of boys and go over; just to encourage him, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>And they went. Tip and Kitty were there again; and again, with Tip, the struggle had to be gone through; his coward spirit whispered to him that the boys would only make fun of him if he said a word and it would do more harm than good. His conscience answered, &#8220;Whosoever will deny me on earth, him with I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.&#8221; The solemn words conquered, and again Tip knelt down and prayed.</p>

<p>&#8220;My!&#8221; said Mr. Minturn, talking with his wife after they reached home, &#8220;when I thought of the bringing up which that boy has had&#8212;no bringing up about it, he has just <i>come</i> up, the easiest way he could&#8212;but when I heard him pray tonight, and then thought of our boy, who has been prayed for and watched over every day since he was born, I declare I felt as though I would give all I&#8217;m worth to have Howard stand where Tip Lewis does now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Howard heard this as he waited in the sitting room for his father and mother; heard it in great amazement, and at first it made him indignant. The idea of comparing <i>him</i> with Tip Lewis! Then it made him sorrowful; his father&#8217;s tones were <i>so</i> sad; after all that had been done for him, it <i>was</i> hard that he should disappoint his parents.</p>

<p>He listed to his father&#8217;s prayer that night very closely, and its earnestness brought the tears to his eyes. Altogether, Howard went to school the next morning with a somewhat sober face and took no part whatever in the boys&#8217; fun over the meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. Burrows&#8217; heart had been warmed by the voice of prayer from one of his scholars, and he began to pray and long for others of them to live for Jesus also; and the great God, who knows the beginning and the end, led his first words of anxiety to Howard Minturn. They stood at the desk, teacher and scholar, Howard bending over his slate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you get it?&#8221; Mr. Burrows asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Howard, are you working with all your thoughts today?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221; And a bright flush mounted to his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Howard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, sir; not much of anything, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you not quite satisfied with yourself today?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Satisfied! I&#8212;why&#8212;I don&#8217;t know what you mean, sir; I have tried to do the best I could, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really think so, Howard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_1/12_talking.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="379" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Did you think so last evening, in the prayer meeting? Can a boy who is as well taught as you have been feel that he is doing as well as he can, when he knows that he is every day cheating God?&#8221;</p>

<p>Howard&#8217;s face fairly burned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you?&#8221; and Mr. Burrow&#8217;s voice was very kind. &#8220;I wish that God&#8217;s own Spirit might help you to understand it. Didn&#8217;t your father and mother promise God, when you were born, to try to train you up for Him, because you belonged to Him and they knew it? Now, haven&#8217;t they done their duty? Is it their fault that you are not a Christian?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it comes back to you. You belong to God, body and soul; He made you; He has kept you; He would save you, only you will not let Him. You can&#8217;t help the fact that you belong to Him; all you can do is to refuse to give Him your love and let Him lead you to heaven, and this you are doing. It is right?&#8221;</p>

<p>Howard was growing haughty.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel the need of any such things, Mr. Burrows,&#8221; he answered coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you don&#8217;t, does that help the matter any? Does it change the fact that you belong to God; that you are cheating him out of His own property? The question I ask is, are you doing right?&#8221;</p>

<p>Howard stood with eyes fixed on his slate saying nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you answer me, Howard?&#8221; Mr. Burrows asked gently. &#8220;Is it right?&#8221;</p>

<p>And after a long, long silence, the boy&#8217;s honest, earnest eyes were raised to his teacher&#8217;s face, and he spoke steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you willing to go on doing wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you turn <i>now,</i> Howard, and start right?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now came another long silence. Howard Minturn, the honest, faithful boy, always getting a little nearer right than any of the others, had been condemned by his own words and knew not what to say. At last he spoke. &#8220;I can&#8217;t promise, Mr. Burrows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Howard! Such an answer from <i>you,</i> to whom I have only needed to point out what was right in order to have it done!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t trust myself, sir; I shall not feel tomorrow as I do now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is, you feel like doing your duty today, but you expect if you wait until tomorrow that you will feel less like it; so you mean to wait. Is that right?&#8221;</p>

<p>The silence was much longer this time; so long that the boys began to look curiously at the two figures over by the desk and wonder why the bell was not rung. But at last he raised those clear, truthful eyes once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Burrows, I&#8217;ll try.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the next Thursday evening, in the house of prayer, when it was very still because Mr. Holbrook had just said, &#8220;Is there not one hear tonight who wants us to pray for him, and if there is, will he not let us know it <i>now?</i>&#8221; suddenly there was a row of astonished faces in the seat where the schoolboys were sitting because from among them arose Howard Minturn, and his face was pale and grave, and his voice was steady; they all heard his words:</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to be a Christian; will you pray for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Oh, wouldn&#8217;t they! Was there ever such another prayer as that which Mr. Minturn offered for his son! Did anyone who heard it wonder that such prayer was answered? And in the next meeting, Howard, speaking with a little ring of joy in his voice, said, &#8220;I love Jesus tonight. I want everyone to love him. I am very happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>From this the work went on. The little lecture room grew full and overflowed, and the crowd now filled the church; and every single night some new voice was heard, asking for prayer.</p>

<p>Will Bailey seemed filled with the spirit of torment; teased the boys unmercifully, went to the meeting every evening, and made fun of it all day; but the boys were praying for him, and God&#8217;s pitying eye was on him.</p>

<p>One evening there were two who arose to ask the prayers of Christians; one was Will Bailey, the most hopeless, so the boys thought, of all the boys in town; the other was Will Bailey&#8217;s gray-haired father, the most hopeless, so the good men feared, of all the strong, self-satisfied men in town.</p>

<p>Yet there were two, for whom daily, earnest prayer was offered, who, in this blessed time, held themselves aloof; two boys, so far separated that it seems strange and sad that their names should be coupled just here. Bob Turner, and Ellis Holbrook, the lowest and the highest; the worst boy in school and the best! Yet they were united in this one thing, that they would have nothing to do with Christ. Tip had prayed for both, worked for both; but this was his success one afternoon:</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Bob, won&#8217;t you go to meeting tonight, just to please me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t, Tip, no way in the world. I&#8217;d do most anything to please you, too, for the sake of old times when we used to steal apples together; but I promised to go with Nick Hunt tonight and tie old Barlow&#8217;s cat fast to his front doorknob, and that&#8217;s got to be done while the old man is at the meeting, you know. Tain&#8217;t no matter, either, about me going; you just do the praying for you and me, too; then it will be all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tip turned away with a sigh and shudder. Could it be possible that <i>that</i> boy had ever been his only companion! Ellis was round by the ball ground, and he went thither.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ellis, won&#8217;t you go down tonight with the boys? It&#8217;s almost the last meeting, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ellis wheeled around and spoke in his coldest tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tip Lewis, you seem to take a wonderful interest in me, and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m much obliged to you; but I&#8217;ll be a great deal more so if you&#8217;ll attend to your own affairs after this and let me alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Tip! How discouraged he felt. Yet that very evening, going home from school, he met Mr. Holbrook; the minister turned and walked uptown with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Edward,&#8221; he said, &#8220;are you praying for my boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you never stop praying for him while you live, until he comes to Christ?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never <i>will,</i> sir,&#8221; answered Tip with energy.</p>

<p>And he didn&#8217;t.</p>
