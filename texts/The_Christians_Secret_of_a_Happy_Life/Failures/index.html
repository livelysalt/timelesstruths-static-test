<h1>Failures</h1>

<p>The very title of this chapter may perhaps startle some. &#8220;Failures,&#8221; they will say; &#8220;we thought there were no failures in this life of faith!&#8221; </p>

<p>To this I would answer that there ought not to be, and need not be; but, as a fact, there sometimes are. And we have got to deal with facts, and not with theories. No teacher of this interior life ever says that it becomes impossible to sin; they only insist that sin ceases to be a necessity, and that a possibility of uniform victory is opened before us. And there are very few who do not confess that, as to their own actual experience, they have at times been overcome by momentary temptation.</p>

<p>Of course, in speaking of sin here, I mean conscious, known sin. I do not touch on the subject of sins of ignorance, or what is called the inevitable sin of our nature, which are all covered by the atonement, and do not disturb our fellowship with God. I have no desire nor ability to treat of the doctrines concerning sin; these I will leave with the theologians to discuss and settle, while I speak only of the believer&#8217;s experience in the matter. And I wish it to be fully understood that in all I shall say, I have reference simply to that which comes within the range of our consciousness.</p>

<p>Misunderstanding, then, on this point of known or conscious sin, opens the way for great dangers in the higher Christian life. When a believer, who has, as he trusts, entered upon the highway of holiness, finds himself surprised into sin, he is tempted either to be utterly discouraged, and to give everything up as lost; or else, in order to preserve the doctrine untouched, he feels it necessary to cover his sin up, calling it infirmity, and refusing to be honest and above-board about it. Either of these courses is equally fatal to any real growth and progress in the life of holiness. The only way is to face the sad fact at once, call the thing by its right name, and discover, if possible, the reason and the remedy. This life of union with God requires the utmost honesty with Him and with ourselves. The communion which the sin itself would only momentarily disturb, is sure to be lost by any dishonest dealing with it. A sudden failure is no reason for being discouraged and giving up all as lost. Neither is the integrity of our doctrine touched by it. We are not preaching a state, but a walk. The highway of holiness is not a place, but a way. Sanctification is not a thing to be picked up at a certain stage of our experience, and forever after possessed, but it is a life to be lived day by day, and hour by hour. We may for a moment turn aside from a path, but the path is not obliterated by our wandering, and can be instantly regained. And in this life and walk of faith, there may be momentary failures, which, although very sad and greatly to be deplored, need not, if rightly met, disturb the attitude of the soul as to entire consecration and perfect trust, nor interrupt, for more than the passing moment, its happy communion with its Lord.</p>

<p>The great point is an instant return to God. Our sin is no reason for ceasing to trust, but only an unanswerable argument why we must trust more fully than ever. From whatever cause we have been betrayed into failure, it is very certain that there is no remedy to be found for it in discouragement. As well might a child who is learning to walk, lie down in despair when he has fallen, and refuse to take another step; as a believer, who is seeking to learn how to live and walk by faith, give up in despair because of having fallen into sin. The only way in both cases is to get right up and try again. When the children of Israel had met with that disastrous defeat, soon after their entrance into the land, before the little city of Ai, they were all so utterly discouraged that we read:</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water. And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads. And Joshua said, Alas, O L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan! O L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies! For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Joshua+7%3A5-9" title="Joshua 7:5-9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Joshua 7:5-9)</span></a></span></p>

<p>What a wail of despair this was! And how exactly it is repeated by many a child of God in the present day, whose heart, because of a defeat, melts and becomes as water, and who cries out, &#8220;Would to God we had been content and dwelt on the other side Jordan!&#8221; and predicts for itself further failures and even utter discomfiture before its enemies. No doubt Joshua thought then, as we are apt to think now, that discouragement and despair were the only proper and safe condition after such a failure. But God thought otherwise.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Joshua+7%3A10" title="Joshua 7:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Joshua 7:10)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>The proper thing to do was not to abandon themselves thus to utter discouragement, humble as it might look, but at once to face the evil and get rid of it, and afresh and immediately to &#8220;sanctify themselves.&#8221;
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Up, sanctify the people,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Joshua+7%3A13" title="Joshua 7:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Joshua 7:13)</span></a></span>
is always God&#8217;s command. &#8220;Lie down and be discouraged,&#8221; is always the enemy&#8217;s temptation. Our feeling is that it is presumptuous, and even almost impertinent, to go at once to the Lord, after having sinned against Him. It seems as if we ought to suffer the consequences our sin first for a little while, and endure the accusings of our conscience. And we can hardly believe that the Lord can be willing at once to receive us back into loving fellowship with Himself.</p>

<p>A little girl once expressed the feeling to me, with a child&#8217;s outspoken candor. She had asked whether the Lord Jesus always forgave us for our sins as soon as we asked Him, and I had said, &#8220;Yes, of course He does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as soon?&#8221; she repeated, doubtingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;the very minute we ask, He forgives us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said deliberately, &#8220;I cannot believe that. I should think He would make us feel sorry for two or three days first. And then I should think He would make us ask Him a great many times, and in a very pretty way too, not just in common talk. And I believe that is the way He does, and you need not try to make me think He forgives me right at once, no matter what the Bible says.&#8221;</p>

<p>She only said what most Christians think, and, what is worse, what most Christians act on, making their discouragement and their very remorse separate them infinitely further off from God than their sin would have done. Yet it is so totally contrary to the way we like our children to act towards us, that I wonder how we ever could have conceived such an idea of God. How a mother grieves when a naughty child goes off alone in despairing remorse, and doubts her willingness to forgive; and how, on the other hand, her whole heart goes out in welcoming love to the darling who runs to her at once and begs her forgiveness! Surely our God knew this yearning love when He said to us,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+3%3A22" title="Jeremiah 3:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jeremiah 3:22)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>The fact is, that the same moment which brings the consciousness of having sinned, ought to bring also the consciousness of being forgiven. This is especially essential to an unwavering walk in the highway of holiness, for no separation from God can be tolerated here for an instant.</p>

<p>We can only walk in this path by looking continually unto Jesus, moment by moment; and if our eyes are taken off of Him to look upon our own sin and our own weakness, we shall leave the path at once. The believer, therefore, who has, as he trusts, entered upon this highway, if he finds himself overcome by sin, must flee with it instantly to the Lord. He must act on
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1%3A9">I&nbsp;John 1:9</a>:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&#8221;</span>
He must not hide his sin and seek to salve it over with excuses, or to push it out of his memory by the lapse of time. But he must do as the children of Israel did,
rise up &#8220;early in the morning,&#8221; and &#8220;run&#8221; to the place where the evil thing is hidden, and take it out of its hiding-place, and lay it out before the Lord (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Joshua+7%3A16-23">Joshua 7:16-23</a>). He must confess his sin. And then he must stone it with stones, and burn it with fire, and utterly put it away from him, and raise over it a great heap of stones, that it may be forever hidden from his sight. And he must believe, then and there, that God is, according to His word, faithful and just to forgive him his sin, and that He does do it; and further, that He also cleanses him from all unrighteousness. He must claim an immediate forgiveness and an immediate cleansing by faith, and must go on trusting harder and more absolutely than ever.</p>

<p>As soon as Israel&#8217;s sin had been brought to light and put away, at once God&#8217;s word came again in a message of glorious encouragement,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Fear not, neither be thou dismayed&#8230;&#8203;I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Joshua+8%3A1" title="Joshua 8:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Joshua 8:1)</span></a></span>
Our courage must rise higher than ever, and we must abandon ourselves more completely to the Lord, that His mighty power may the more perfectly work in us all the good pleasure of His will. Moreover, we must forget our sin as soon as it is thus confessed and forgiven. We must not dwell on it, and examine it, and indulge in a luxury of distress and remorse. We must not put it on a pedestal, and then walk around it and view it on every side, and so magnify it into a mountain that hides our God from our eyes. We must follow the example of Paul, and
<span class="scripture">&#8220;forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,&#8221;</span>
we must
<span class="scripture">&#8220;press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+3%3A13-14" title="Philippians 3:13-14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 3:13-14)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>I would like to bring up two contrastive illustrations of these things. One was an earnest Christian man, an active worker in the Church, who had been living for several months in the enjoyment of full salvation. He was suddenly overcome by a temptation to treat a brother unkindly. Not having supposed it possible that he could ever sin again, he was at once plunged into the deepest discouragement, and concluded he had been altogether mistaken, and had never entered into the life of full trust at all. Day by day his discouragement increased, until it became despair, and he concluded he had never even been born again, and gave himself up for lost. He spent three years of utter misery, going further and further away from God, and being gradually drawn off into one sin after another, until his life was a curse to himself and to all around him. His health failed under the terrible burden, and fears were entertained for his reason.</p>

<p>At the end of three years he met a Christian lady, who understood the truth about sin that I have been trying to explain. In a few moments&#8217; conversation she found out his trouble, and at once said, &#8220;You sinned in that act, there is no doubt about it, and I do not want you to try and excuse it. But have you never confessed it to the Lord and asked Him to forgive you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Confessed it!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;why it seems to me I have done nothing but confess it, and entreat God to forgive me night and day for all these three dreadful years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you have never believed He did forgive you?&#8221; asked the lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the poor man, &#8220;how could I, for I never felt as if He did?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But suppose He had said He forgave you, would not that have done as well as for you to feel it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; replied the man, &#8220;if God said it, of course I would believe it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, He does say so,&#8221; was the lady&#8217;s answer, and she turned to
the verse we have taken above (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1%3A9">I&nbsp;John 1:9</a>)
and read it aloud. &#8220;Now,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;you have been all these three years confessing and confessing your sin, and all the while God&#8217;s record has been declaring that He was faithful and just to forgive it and to cleanse you, and yet you have never once believed it. You have been making God a liar [<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+5%3A10">I&nbsp;John 5:10</a>] all this while by refusing to believe His record.&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor man saw the whole thing, and was dumb with amazement and consternation; and when the lady proposed they should kneel down, and that he should confess his past unbelief and sin, and should claim, then and there, a present forgiveness and a present cleansing, he obeyed like one in a maze. But the result was glorious. In a few moments the light broke in, and he burst out into praise at the wonderful deliverance. In three minutes his soul was enabled to traverse back by faith the whole long weary journey that he had been three years in making, and he found himself once more resting in Jesus, and rejoicing in the fulness of His salvation.</p>

<p>The other illustration was the case of a Christian lady who had been living in the land of promise about two weeks, and who had had a very bright and victorious experience. Suddenly, at the end of that time, she was overcome by a violent burst of anger. For a moment a flood of discouragement swept over her soul. The enemy said, &#8220;There, now, that shows it was all a mistake. Of course you have been deceived about the whole thing, and have never entered into the life of full trust at all. And now you may as well give up altogether, for you never can consecrate yourself any more entirely, nor trust any more fully, than you did this time; so it is very plain this life of holiness is not for you!&#8221; These thoughts flashed through her mind in a moment, but she was well taught in the ways of God, and she said at once, &#8220;Yes, I have sinned, and it is very sad. But the Bible says that if we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness, and I believe He will do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not delay a moment, but while still boiling over with anger, she ran, she could not walk, into a room where she could be alone, and kneeling down beside the bed, she said, &#8220;Lord, I confess my sin. I have sinned, I am even at this very moment sinning. I hate it, but I cannot get rid of it. I confess it with shame and confusion of face to Thee. And now I believe that, according to Thy word, Thou dost forgive and Thou dost cleanse.&#8221; She said it out loud, for the inward turmoil was too great for it to be said inside. As the words &#8220;Thou dost forgive and Thou dost cleanse&#8221; passed her lips, the deliverance came. The Lord said, &#8220;Peace, be still,&#8221; and there was a great calm. A flood of light and joy burst on her soul, the enemy fled, and she was more than conqueror through Him that loved her. The whole thing, the sin and the recovery from it, had occupied not five minutes, and her feet trod on more firmly than ever in the blessed highway of holiness. Thus the
valley of Achor (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Joshua+7%3A26">Joshua 7:26</a>)
became to her a door of hope, and she sang afresh and with deeper meaning her song of deliverance, &#8220;I will sing unto the Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously.&#8221;</p>

<p>The truth is, the only remedy, after all in every emergency, is to trust in the Lord. And if this is all we ought to do, and all we can do, is it not better to do it at once? I have often been brought up short by the question, &#8220;Well, what can I do but trust?&#8221; And I have realized at once the folly of seeking for deliverance in any other way, by saying to myself, &#8220;I shall have to come to simple trusting in the end, and why not come to it at once now in the beginning?&#8221; It is a life and walk of faith we have entered upon, and if we fail in it our only recovery must lie in an increase of faith, not in a lessening of it.</p>

<p>Let every failure, then, if any occur, drive you instantly to the Lord, with a more complete abandonment and a more perfect trust; and you will find that, sad as they are, they will not take you out of the land of rest, nor permanently interrupt your sweet communion with Him.</p>

<p>And now, having shown the way of deliverance from failure, I want to say a little as to the causes of failure in this life of full salvation. The causes do not lie in the strength of the temptation nor in our own weakness, nor, above all, in any lack in the power or willingness of our Savior to save us. The promise to Israel was positive,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Joshua+1%3A5" title="Joshua 1:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Joshua 1:5)</span></a></span>
And the promise to us is equally positive.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+10%3A13" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 10:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 10:13)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>The men of Ai were
<span class="scripture">&#8220;but few,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Joshua+7%3A3" title="Joshua 7:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Joshua 7:3)</span></a></span>
and yet the people who had conquered the mighty Jericho
<span class="scripture">&#8220;fled before the men of Ai.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Joshua+7%3A4" title="Joshua 7:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Joshua 7:4)</span></a></span>
It was not the strength of their enemy, neither had God failed them. The cause of their defeat lay somewhere else, and the Lord Himself declares it,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff. Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Joshua+7%3A11-12" title="Joshua 7:11-12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Joshua 7:11-12)</span></a></span>
It was a hidden evil that conquered them. Deep down under the earth, in an obscure tent in that vast army, was hidden something against which God had a controversy, and this little hidden thing made the whole army helpless before their enemies.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Joshua+7%3A13" title="Joshua 7:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Joshua 7:13)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>The teaching here is simply this, that anything allowed in the heart which is contrary to the will of God, let it seem ever so insignificant, or be ever so deeply hidden, will cause us to fall before our enemies. Any root of bitterness cherished towards another, any self-seeking and harsh judgments indulged in, any slackness in obeying the voice of the Lord, any doubtful habits or surroundings, any one of these things will effectually cripple and paralyze our spiritual life. We may have hidden the evil in the most remote corner of our hearts, and may have covered it over from our sight, refusing even to recognize its existence, of which, however, we cannot help being all the time secretly aware. We may steadily ignore it, and persist in declarations of consecration and full trust, we may be more earnest than ever in our religious duties, and have the eyes of our understanding opened more and more to the truth and the beauty of the life and walk of faith. We may seem to ourselves and to others to have reached an almost impregnable position of victory, and yet we may find ourselves suffering bitter defeats. We may wonder, and question, and despair, and pray; nothing will do any good until the accursed thing is dug up from its hiding-place, brought out to the light, and laid before God. And the moment a believer who is walking in this interior life meets with a defeat, he must at once seek for the cause not in the strength of that particular enemy, but in something behind, some hidden want of consecration lying at the very centre of his being. Just as a headache is not the disease itself, but only a symptom of a disease situated in some other part of the body, so the sin in such a Christian is only the symptom of an evil hidden probably in a very different part of his being.</p>

<p>Sometimes the evil may be hidden even in that, which at a cursory glance, would look like good. Beneath apparent zeal for the truth, may be hidden a judging spirit, or a subtle leaning to our own understanding. Beneath apparent Christian faithfulness, may be hidden an absence of Christian love. Beneath an apparently rightful care for our affairs, may be hidden a great want of trust in God. I believe our blessed Guide, the indwelling Holy Spirit, is always secretly discovering these things to us by continual little twinges and pangs of conscience, so that we are left without excuse. But it is very easy to disregard His gentle voice, and insist upon it to ourselves that all is right; and thus the fatal evil will continue hidden in our midst causing defeat in most unexpected quarters.</p>

<p>A capital illustration of this occurred to me once in my housekeeping. I had moved into a new house and, in looking over it to see if it was all ready for occupancy, I noticed in the cellar a very clean-looking cider-cask headed up at both ends. I debated with myself whether I should have it taken out of the cellar and opened to see what was in it, but concluded, as it seemed empty and looked nice, to leave it undisturbed, especially as it would have been quite a piece of work to get it up the stairs. I did not feel quite easy, but reasoned away my scruples and left it. Every spring and fall, when house-cleaning time came on, I would remember that cask, with a little twinge of my housewifely conscience, feeling that I could not quite rest in the thought of a perfectly cleaned house, while it remained unopened, for how did I know but under its fair exterior it contained some hidden evil. Still I managed to quiet my scruples on the subject, thinking always of the trouble it would involve to investigate it; and for two or three years the innocent-looking cask stood quietly in my cellar.</p>

<p>Then, most unaccountably, moths began to fill my house. I used every possible precaution against them, and made every effort to eradicate them, but in vain. They increased rapidly and threatened to ruin everything I had. I suspected my carpets as being the cause, and subjected them to a thorough cleaning. I suspected my furniture, and had it newly upholstered. I suspected all sorts of impossible things. At last the thought of the cask flashed on me. At once I had it brought up out of the cellar and the head knocked in, and I think it is safe to say that thousands of moths poured out. The previous occupant of the house must have headed it up with something in it which bred moths, and this was the cause of all my trouble.</p>

<p>Now I believe that, in the same way, some innocent-looking habit or indulgence, some apparently unimportant and safe thing, about which we yet have now and then little twinges of conscience, something which is not brought out fairly into the light, and investigated under the searching eye of God, lies at the root of most of the failure in this higher life. All is not given up. Some secret corner is kept locked against the entrance of the Lord. And therefore we cannot stand before our enemies, but find ourselves smitten down in their presence.</p>

<p>In order to prevent failure, or to discover its cause if we have failed, it is necessary that we should keep continually before us this prayer,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+139%3A23-24" title="Psalm 139:23-24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 139:23-24)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>There may be something very deceptive in our sufferings over our failures. We may seem to ourselves to be wholly occupied with the glory of God, and yet in our inmost souls it may be self alone that occasions all our trouble. Our self-love is touched in a tender spot by the discovery that we are not so saintly as we thought we were; and this chagrin is often a greater sin than the original fault itself.</p>

<p>The only safe way to treat our failures is neither to justify nor condemn ourselves on account of them, but to lay them quietly and in simplicity before the Lord, looking at them in peace and in the spirit of love.</p>

<p>All the old mystic writers tell us that our progress is aided far more by a simple, peaceful turning to God, than by all our chagrin and remorse over our lapses from Him. Only be faithful, they say, in turning quietly to Him alone, the moment you perceive what you have done, and His presence will deliver you from the snares which have entrapped you. To look at self plunges you deeper into the slough, for this very slough is, after all, nothing but self; while the gentlest look towards God will calm and deliver your heart.</p>

<p>Finally, let us never forget for one moment, no matter how often we may fail, that the Lord Jesus, able, according to the declaration concerning Him, to deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, that we may
<span class="scripture">&#8220;serve him without fear, In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+1%3A74-75" title="Luke 1:74-75"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 1:74-75)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Let us then pray, everyone of us, day and night, &#8220;Lord, keep us from sinning, and make us living witnesses of Thy mighty power to save to the uttermost&#8221;; and let us never be satisfied until we are so pliable in His hands, and have learned so to trust Him, that He will be able to
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+13%3A21" title="Hebrews 13:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 13:21)</span></a></span>
