<h1>Oneness with Christ</h1>

<p>All the dealings of God with the soul of the believer are in order to bring him into oneness with Himself, that the prayer of our Lord may be fulfilled:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us&#8230;. I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+17%3A21%2C23" title="John 17:21,23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 17:21,23)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>This soul-union was the glorious purpose in the heart of God for His people before the foundation of the world. It was the mystery hid from ages and generations. It was accomplished in the incarnation of Christ. It has been made known by the Scriptures. And it is realized as an actual experience by many of God&#8217;s dear children.</p>

<p>But not by all. It is true of all, and God has not hidden it or made it hard, but the eyes of many are too dim and their hearts too unbelieving, and they fail to grasp it. And it is for the very purpose of bringing them into the personal and actual realization of this, that the Lord is stirring up believers everywhere at the present time to abandon themselves to Him, that He may work in them all the good pleasure of His will.</p>

<p>All the previous steps in the Christian life lead up to this. The Lord has made us for it; and until we have intelligently apprehended it, and have voluntarily consented to embrace it, the travail of His soul for us is not satisfied, nor have our hearts found their destined and final rest.</p>

<p>The usual course of Christian experience is pictured in the history of the disciples. First they were awakened to see their condition and their need, and they came to Christ and gave in their allegiance to Him. Then they followed Him, worked for Him, believed in Him; and yet, how unlike Him! seeking to be set up one above the other; running away from the cross; misunderstanding His mission and His words; forsaking their Lord in time of danger; but still sent out to preach, recognized by Him as His disciples, possessing power to work for Him. They knew Christ only &#8220;after the flesh,&#8221; as outside of them, their Lord and Master, but not yet their Life.</p>

<p>Then came Pentecost, and these disciples came to know Him as inwardly revealed; as one with them in actual union, their very indwelling Life. Henceforth He was to them Christ within, working in them to will and to do of His good pleasure; delivering them by the law of the Spirit of His life from the bondage to the law of sin and death, under which they had been held. No longer was it between themselves and Him, a war of wills and a clashing of interest. One will alone animated them, and that was His will. One interest alone was dear to them, and that was His. They were made <b>one</b> with Him.</p>

<p>And surely all can recognize this picture, though perhaps as yet the final stage of it has not been fully reached. You may have left much to follow Christ, dear reader; you may have believed on him, and worked for Him, and loved Him, and yet may not be like Him. Allegiance you know, and confidence you know, but not yet union. There are two wills, two interests, two lives. You have not yet lost your own life that you may live only in His. Once it was &#8220;I and not Christ&#8221;; then it was &#8220;I <i>and</i> Christ&#8221;; perhaps now it is even &#8220;Christ and I.&#8221; But has it come yet to be &#8220;Christ <i>only</i>, and not I at all&#8221;?</p>

<p>Perhaps you do not understand what this oneness means. Some people think it consists in a great emotion or a wonderful feeling of oneness, and they turn inward to examine their emotions, thinking to decide by the state of these, what is the state of their interior union with God. But nowhere is the mistake of trusting to feelings greater than here.</p>

<p>Oneness with Christ must, in the very nature of things, consists in a Christ-like life and character. It is not what we feel, but what we are that settles the question. No matter how exalted or intense our emotions on the subject may be, if there is not a likeness of character with Christ, a unity of aim and purpose, a similarity of thought and of action, there can be no real oneness.</p>

<p>This is plain common-sense, and it is Scriptural as well.</p>

<p>We speak of two people being one, and we mean that their purposes, and actions, and thoughts, and desires are alike. A friend may pour out upon us enthusiastic expressions of love, and unity and oneness, but if that friend&#8217;s aims, and actions, and ways of looking at things are exactly opposite to ours, we cannot feel there is any real oneness between us, notwithstanding all our affection for one another. To be truly one with another, we must have the same likes and dislikes, the same joys and sorrows, the same hopes and fears. As someone says, &#8220;We must look through one another&#8217;s eyes, and think with one another&#8217;s brains.&#8221; This is, as I said above, only plain commonsense.</p>

<p>And oneness with Christ can be judged by no other rule. It is out of the question to be one with Him in any other way than in the way of nature, and character, and life. Unless we are Christ-like in our thoughts and our ways, we are not one with Him, no matter how we feel.</p>

<p>I have seen Christians, with hardly one Christ-like attribute in their whole characters, who yet were so emotional and had such ecstatic feelings of love for Christ, as to think themselves justified in claiming the closest oneness with Him. I scarcely know a sadder sight. Surely our Lord meant to reach such cases when He said
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+7%3A21" title="Matthew 7:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 7:21)</span></a></span>
He was not making here any arbitrary statement of God&#8217;s will, but a simple announcement of the nature of things. Of course it must be so. It is like saying, &#8220;No man can enter the ranks of astronomers who is not an astronomer.&#8221; Emotions will not make a man an astronomer, but life and action. He must be one, not merely feel that he is one.</p>

<p>There is no escape from this inexorable nature of things, and especially here. Unless we are one with Christ as to character and life and action, we cannot be one with Him in any other way, for there is no other way. We must be
<span class="scripture">&#8220;partakers of [His] nature&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+1%3A4" title="II&nbsp;Peter 1:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 1:4)</span></a></span>
or we cannot be partakers of His life, for His life and His nature are one.</p>

<p>But emotional souls do not always recognize this. They feel so near Christ and so united to Him, that they think it must be real; and overlooking the absolute necessity of Christ-likeness of character and walk, they are building their hopes and their confidence on their delightful emotions and exalted feelings, and think they must be one with Him, or they could not have such rich and holy experiences.</p>

<p>Now it is a psychological fact that these or similar emotions can be produced by other causes than a purely divine influence, and that they are largely dependent upon temperament and physical conditions. It is most dangerous, therefore, to make them a test of our spiritual union with Christ. It may result in just such a grievous self-deception as our Lord warns against in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+6%3A46-49">Luke 6:46-49</a>,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?&#8221;</span>
Our soul delights perhaps in calling Him, &#8220;Lord, Lord,&#8221; but are we doing the things which He said? for this, He tells us, is the important point, after all.</p>

<p>If, therefore, led by our feelings, we are saying in meetings, or among our friends, or even in our own heart before the Lord, that we are abiding in Him, let us take home to ourselves in solemn consideration these words of the Holy Ghost,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;He that saith he abideth in him ought himself so to walk, even as he walked.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+2%3A6" title="I&nbsp;John 2:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 2:6)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Unless we are thus walking, we cannot possibly be abiding in Him, no matter how much we may feel as if we were.</p>

<p>If you are really one with Christ you will be sweet to those who are cross to you; you will bear everything and make no complaints; when you are reviled you will not revile again; you will consent to be trampled on, as Christ was, and feel nothing but love in return; you will seek the honor of others rather than your own; you will take the lowest place, and be the servant of all, as Christ was; you will literally and truly love your enemies and do good to them that despitefully use you; you will, in short, live a Christ-like life, and manifest outwardly as well as feel inwardly a Christ-like spirit, and will walk among men as He walked among them. This, dear friends, is what it is to be one with Christ. And if all this is not your life according to your measure, then you are not one with Him, no matter how ecstatic or exalted your feelings may be.</p>

<p>To be one with Christ is too wonderful and solemn and mighty an experience to be reached by any overflow or exaltation of mere feeling. He was holy, and those who are one with Him will be holy also. There is no escape from this simple and obvious fact.</p>

<p>When our Lord tried to make us understand His oneness with God, He expressed it in such words as these,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I do always those things that please him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+8%3A29" title="John 8:29"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 8:29)</span></a></span>
&#8220;Whatsoever He saith unto me that I do.&#8221;
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do: for what things soever He doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+15%3A19" title="John 15:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 15:19)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+5%3A30" title="John 5:30"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 5:30)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+10%3A37-38" title="John 10:37-38"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 10:37-38)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>The test of oneness then, was the doing of the same works, and it is the test of oneness now. And if our Lord could say of Himself that if He did not the works of his Father, He did not ask to be believed, no matter what professions or claims He might make, surely His disciples must do no less.</p>

<p>It is forever true in the nature of things that
<span class="scripture">&#8220;A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+7%3A18" title="Matthew 7:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 7:18)</span></a></span>
It is not that they <i>will</i> not, but they <i>cannot</i>. And a soul that is one with Christ will just as surely bring forth a Christ-like life, as a grapevine will bring forth grapes and not thistles.</p>

<p>Not that I would be understood to object to emotions. On the contrary, I believe they are very precious gifts, when they are from God, and are to be greatly rejoiced in. But what I do object to is the making them a test or proof of spiritual states, either in ourselves or others, and depending on them as the foundation of our faith. Let them come or let them go, just as God pleases, and make no account of them either way. But always see to it that the really vital marks of oneness with Christ, the marks of likeness in character, and life, and walk, are ours, and all will be well. For
<span class="scripture">&#8220;He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+2%3A4-5" title="I&nbsp;John 2:4-5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 2:4-5)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>It may be, my dear reader, that the grief of your life has been the fact that you have so few good feelings. You try your hardest to get up the feelings which you hear others talking about, but they will not come. You pray for them fervently, and are often tempted to upbraid God because He does not grant them to you. And you are filled with an almost unbearable anguish because you think your want of emotion is a sign that there is not any interior union of your soul with Christ. You judge altogether by your feelings, and think there is no other way to judge.</p>

<p>Now my advice to you is to let your feelings go, and pay no regard to them whatever. They really have nothing to do with the matter. They are not the indicators of your spiritual state, but are merely the indicators of your temperament, or of your present physical condition. People in very low states of grace are often the subjects of very powerful emotional experiences. We all know this from the scenes we have heard of or witnessed at camp-meetings and revivals. I myself had a colored servant once who would become unconscious under the power of her wonderful experiences, whenever there was a revival meeting at their church, who yet had hardly a token of any spiritual life about her at other times, and who was, in fact, not even moral. Now surely, if the Bible teaches nothing else, it does teach this, that a Christ-like life and walk must accompany any experience which is really born of His Spirit. It could not be otherwise in the very nature of things. But I fear some Christians have separated the two things so entirely in their conceptions, as to have exalted their experiences at the expense of their walk, and have come to care far more about their emotions than about their character.</p>

<p>A certain colored congregation in one of the Southern states was a plague to the whole neighborhood by their open disregard of even the ordinary rules of morality; stealing, and lying, and cheating, without apparently a single prick of conscience on the subject. And yet their nightly meetings were times of the greatest emotion and &#8220;power.&#8221; Someone finally spoke to the preacher about it, and begged him to preach a sermon on morality, which would lead his people to see their sins. &#8220;Ah, missus,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I knows dey&#8217;s bad, but den it always brings a coldness like over de meetings when I preaches about dem things.&#8221;</p>

<p>You are helpless as to your emotions, but character you can have if you will. You can be so filled with Christ as to be Christ-like, and if you are Christ-like, then you are one with Him in the only vital and essential way, even though your feelings may tell you that it is an impossibility.</p>

<p>Having thus settled what oneness with Christ really is, the next point for us to consider is how to reach it for ourselves.</p>

<p>We must first of all find out what are the facts in the case, and what is our own relation to these facts.</p>

<p>If you read such passages as
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+3%3A16">I&nbsp;Corinthians 3:16</a>,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?&#8221;</span>
and then look at the opening of the chapter to see to whom these wonderful words are spoken, even to
<span class="scripture">&#8220;babes in Christ,&#8221;</span>
who were
<span class="scripture">&#8220;yet carnal,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+3%3A1-3" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 3:1-3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 3:1-3)</span></a></span>
and walked according to man, you will see that this soul-union of which I speak, this unspeakably glorious mystery of an indwelling God is the possession of even the weakest and most failing believer in Christ. So that it is not a new thing you are to ask for, but only to realize that which you already have. Of every believer in the Lord Jesus it is absolutely true, that
his body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in him, which he has of God (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+6%3A19">I&nbsp;Corinthians 6:19</a>).
</p>

<p>It seems to me just in this way; as though Christ were living in a house, shut up in a far-off closet, unknown and unnoticed by the dwellers in the house, longing to make Himself known to them and be one with them in all their daily lives, and share in all their interests, but unwilling to force Himself upon their notice; as nothing but a voluntary companionship could meet or satisfy the needs of His love. The days pass by over that favored household, and they remain in ignorance of their marvellous privilege. They come and go about all their daily affairs with no thought of their wonderful Guest. Their plans are laid without reference to Him. His wisdom to guide, and His strength to protect, are all lost to them. Lonely days and weeks are spent in sadness, which might have been full of the sweetness of His presence.</p>

<p>But suddenly the announcement is made, &#8220;The Lord is in the house!&#8221;</p>

<p>How will its owner receive the intelligence? Will he call out an eager thanksgiving, and throw wide open every door for the entrance of his glorious Guest? Or will he shrink and hesitate, afraid of His presence and seek to reserve some private corner for a refuge from His all-seeing eye?</p>

<p>Dear friend, I make the glad announcement to thee that the Lord is in thy heart. Since the day of thy conversion He has been dwelling there, but thou hast lived on in ignorance of it. Every moment during all that time might have been passed in the sunshine of His sweet presence, and every step have been taken under His advice. But because thou knew it not, and hast never looked for Him there, thy life has been lonely and full of failure. But now that I make the announcement to thee, how wilt thou receive it? Art thou glad to have Him? Wilt thou throw wide open every door to welcome Him in? Wilt thou joyfully and thankfully give up the government of thy life into His hands? Wilt thou consult Him about everything, and let Him decide each step for thee, and mark out every path? Wilt thou invite Him to thy innermost chambers, and make Him the sharer in thy most hidden life? Wilt thou say, &#8220;<b>Yes</b>!&#8221; to all His longing for union with thee, and with a glad and eager abandonment, hand thyself and all that concerns thee over into His hands? If thou wilt, then shall thy soul begin to know something of the joy of union with Christ.</p>

<p>And yet, after all, this is but a faint picture of the blessed reality. For, far more glorious than it would be to have Christ a dweller in the house or in the heart, is it to be brought into such a real and actual union with Him as to be one with Him&#8212;one will, one purpose, one interest, one life. Human words cannot express such glory as this. And yet I want to express it. I want to make your souls so unutterably hungry to realize it, that day or night you cannot rest without it. Do you understand the words, &#8220;one with Christ&#8221;? Do you catch the slightest glimpse of their marvellous meaning? Does not your whole soul begin to exult over such a wondrous destiny? For it is a reality. It means to have no life but His life, to have no will but His will, to have no interests but His interests, to share His riches, to enter into His joys, to partake of His sorrows, to manifest His life, to have the same mind as He had, to think, and feel, and act, and walk as He did. Oh, who could have dreamed that such a destiny could have been ours!</p>

<p>Wilt thou have it, dear soul? Thy Lord will not force it on thee, for He wants thee as His companion and His friend, and a forced union would be incompatible with this. It must be voluntary on thy part.</p>

<p>The bride must say a willing &#8220;Yes,&#8221; to her bridegroom, or the joy of their union is utterly wanting. Canst thou say a willing &#8220;Yes,&#8221; to thy Lord?</p>

<p>It is such a simple transaction, and yet so real! The steps are but three. First, be convinced that the Scriptures teach this glorious indwelling of thy God; then surrender thy whole being to Him to be possessed by Him; and finally believe that He has taken possession, and is dwelling in thee. Begin to reckon thyself dead, and to reckon Christ as thy only life. Maintain this attitude of soul unwaveringly. Say,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galations+2%3A20" title="Galations 2:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galations 2:20)</span></a></span>
over and over, day and night, until it becomes the habitual breathing of thy soul. Put off thy self-life <i>by faith</i> and <i>in fact</i> continually, and put on practically the life of Christ. Let this act become, by its constant repetition, the attitude of thy whole being. And as surely as thou dost this day by day,
thou shalt find thyself continually bearing about in thy body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in thy mortal flesh (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+4%3A10">II&nbsp;Corinthians 4:10</a>). Thou shalt learn to know what salvation means; and shalt have opened out to thy astonished gaze secrets of the Lord, of which thou hast hitherto hardly dreamed.</p>

<p class="verse">How have I erred! God is my home<br />And God Himself is here.<br />Why have I looked so far for Him,<br />Who is nowhere but near?</p>

<p class="verse">Yet God is never so far off<br />As even to be near;<br />He is within, our spirit is<br />The home He holds most dear.</p>

<p class="verse">So all the while I thought myself<br />Homeless, forlorn, and weary;<br />Missing my joy, I walked the earth,<br />Myself God&#8217;s sanctuary.</p>
