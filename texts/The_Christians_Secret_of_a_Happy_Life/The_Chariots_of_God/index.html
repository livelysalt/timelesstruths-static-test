<h1>The Chariots of God</h1>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+68%3A17" title="Psalm 68:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 68:17)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Chariots are for conveyance and progress. Earthly chariots carry the bodies of those who ride in them over all intervening distances or obstacles to the place of their destination, and God&#8217;s chariots carry their souls. No words can express the glorious places to which that soul shall arrive who travels in the chariots of God. And our verse tells us they are &#8220;very many.&#8221; All around us on every side they wait for us; but we, alas! we do not always see them. Earth&#8217;s chariots are always visible, but God&#8217;s chariots are invisible.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about. And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do? And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them. And Elisha prayed, and said, L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Kings+6%3A14-17" title="II&nbsp;Kings 6:14-17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Kings 6:14-17)</span></a></span></p>

<p>The king of Syria came up against the man of God with horses and chariots that were visible to everyone, but God had chariots that could be seen by none save the eye of faith. The servant of the prophet could only see the outward and visible, and he cried, as so many have done since,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Alas, my master! how shall we do?&#8221;</span>
But the prophet himself sat calmly within his house without fear, because his eyes were opened to see the invisible. And all that he asked for his servant was,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see.&#8221;</span>
</p>

<p>This is the prayer we need to pray for ourselves and for one another, &#8220;Lord, open our eyes that we may see.&#8221; For the world all around us is full of God&#8217;s horses and chariots, waiting to carry us to places of glorious victory.</p>

<p>But they do not look like chariots. They look instead like enemies, sufferings, trials, defeats, misunderstandings, disappointments, unkindnesses. They look like Juggernaut cars of misery and wretchedness, that are only waiting to roll over us and crush us into the earth; but they really are chariots of triumph in which we may ride to those very heights of victory for which our souls have been longing and praying.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;So the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him. He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+32%3A12-13" title="Deuteronomy 32:12-13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Deuteronomy 32:12-13)</span></a></span></p>

<p>If we would
<span class="scripture">&#8220;ride on the high places of the earth&#8221;</span>
we must get into the chariots that can take us there; and only the
<span class="scripture">&#8220;chariots of God&#8221;</span>
are equal to such lofty riding as this.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Then shalt thou delight thyself in the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> hath spoken it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+58%3A14" title="Isaiah 58:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 58:14)</span></a></span></p>

<p>We may make out of each event in our lives either a Juggernaut car to crush us, or a chariot in which to ride to heights of victory. It all depends upon how we take them; whether we lie down under our trials and let them roll over and crush us, or whether we climb up into them as into a chariot, and make them carry us triumphantly onward and upward.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Kings+2%3A11-12" title="II&nbsp;Kings 2:11-12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Kings 2:11-12)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Whenever we mount into God&#8217;s chariots the same thing happens to us spiritually that happened to Elisha. We shall have a translation. Not into the heavens above us, as Elisha did, but into the heaven within us, which after all is almost a grander translation than his. We shall be carried up away from the low earthly groveling plane of life, where everything hurts and everything is unhappy, up into the
<span class="scripture">&#8220;heavenly places in Christ Jesus,&#8221;</span>
where we shall ride in triumph over all below.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+2%3A6" title="Ephesians 2:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 2:6)</span></a></span></p>

<p>These
<span class="scripture">&#8220;heavenly places&#8221;</span>
are interior, not exterior, and the road that leads to them is interior also. But the chariot that carries the soul over this road is generally some outward loss, or trial or disappointment; some chastening that does not indeed seem for the present to be joyous, but grievous; but that nevertheless afterward yieldeth the peaceable fruits of righteousness to them that are exercised thereby.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons. Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live? For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness. Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A5-11" title="Hebrews 12:5-11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 12:5-11)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Look upon these chastenings, no matter how grievous they may be for the present, as God&#8217;s chariots sent to carry your souls into the &#8220;high places&#8221; of spiritual achievement and uplifting, and you will find that they are after all
<span class="scripture">&#8220;paved with love.&#8221;</span>
</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon. He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Song+3%3A9-10" title="Song 3:9-10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Song 3:9-10)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Your own individual chariot may look very unlovely. It maybe a cross-grained relative or friend; it may be the result of human malice, or cruelty, or neglect; but every chariot sent by God must necessarily be paved with love, since God is love, and God&#8217;s love is the sweetest, softest, tenderest thing to rest one&#8217;s self upon that was ever found by any soul anywhere. It is His love indeed that sends the chariot.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Was the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> displeased against the rivers? was thine anger against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation?&#8230;&#8203;Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger. Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Habakkuk+3%3A8%2C12-13" title="Habakkuk 3:8,12-13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Habakkuk 3:8,12-13)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Here the prophet tells us that it was God&#8217;s displeasure against the obstacles which beset the path of His people that made Him come to their rescue, riding in His
<span class="scripture">&#8220;chariots of salvation.&#8221;</span>
Everything becomes a &#8220;chariot of salvation&#8221; when God rides upon it.</p>

<p>The &#8220;clouds&#8221; that darken our skies and seem to shut out the shining of the sun of righteousness are, after all, if we only knew it, His chariots, into which we may mount with Him, and
<span class="scripture">&#8220;ride prosperously&#8221;</span>
over all the darkness.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty. And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+45%3A3-4" title="Psalm 45:3-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 45:3-4)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+18%3A10" title="Psalm 18:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 18:10)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+33%3A26" title="Deuteronomy 33:26"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Deuteronomy 33:26)</span></a></span></p>

<p>A late writer has said that we cannot, by even the most vigorous and toilsome efforts, sweep away the clouds, but we can climb so high above them as to reach the clear atmosphere overhead; and he who rides with God rides upon the heavens far above all earth-born clouds. </p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah: To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice. Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+68%3A32-34" title="Psalm 68:32-34"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 68:32-34)</span></a></span></p>

<p>This may sound fanciful, but it is really exceedingly practical when we begin to act it out in our daily lives.</p>

<p>I knew a lady who had a very slow servant. She was an excellent girl in every other respect, and very valuable in the household, but her slowness was a constant source of irritation to her mistress, who was naturally quick, and who always chafed at slowness. The lady would consequently get out of temper with the girl twenty times a day, and twenty times a day would repent of her anger, and resolve to conquer it, but in vain. Her life was made miserable by the conflict. One day it occurred to her that she had for a long while been praying for patience, and that perhaps this slow servant was the very chariot the Lord had sent to carry her soul over into patience. She immediately accepted it as such, and from that time used the slowness of her servant as a chariot for her soul. And the result was a victory of patience that no slowness of anybody was ever after able to disturb.</p>

<p>Another instance: I knew a sister at one of our conventions who was put to sleep in a room with two others on account of the crowd. She wanted to sleep, but they wanted to talk, and the first night she was greatly disturbed, and lay there fretting and fuming long after the others had hushed and she might have slept. But the next day she heard something about God&#8217;s chariots, and that night she accepted these talking sisters as her chariots to carry her over into sweetness and patience, and she lay there feeling peaceful and at rest. When, however, it grew very late, and she knew they all ought to be sleeping, she ventured to say slyly, &#8220;Sisters, I am lying here riding in a chariot,&#8221; and the effect was instantaneous in producing perfect quiet. Her chariot had carried her over to victory, not only inwardly, but at last outwardly as well.</p>

<p>If we would ride in God&#8217;s chariots, instead of in our own, we should find this to be the case continually.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>! Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words: but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity. Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall down, and they all shall fail together.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+31%3A1-3" title="Isaiah 31:1-3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 31:1-3)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> our God. They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+20%3A7-8" title="Psalm 20:7-8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 20:7-8)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Our constant temptation is to trust in the &#8220;chariots of Egypt.&#8221; We can see them; they are tangible and real, and they look so substantial; while God&#8217;s chariots are invisible and intangible, and it is hard to believe they are there. Our eyes are not opened to see them.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Kings+19%3A23" title="II&nbsp;Kings 19:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Kings 19:23)</span></a></span></p>

<p>We try to reach the high places with the &#8220;multitude of our chariots.&#8221; We depend first on one thing, and then on another, to advance our spiritual condition and to gain our spiritual victories. We
<span class="scripture">&#8220;go down to Egypt for help.&#8221;</span>
And God is obliged often to destroy all our own chariots before he can bring us to the point of mounting into His.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Micah+5%3A10" title="Micah 5:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Micah 5:10)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, everyone by the sword of his brother.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Haggai+2%3A22" title="Haggai 2:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Haggai 2:22)</span></a></span></p>

<p>We lean too much upon a dear friend to help us onward in the spiritual life, and the Lord is obliged to separate us from that friend. We feel that all our spiritual prosperity depends on our continuance under the ministry of a favorite preacher, and we are mysteriously removed. We look upon our prayer-meeting or our Bible-class as the chief source of our spiritual strength, and we are shut up from attending it. And the &#8220;chariot of God,&#8221; which alone can carry us to the places where we hoped to be taken by the instrumentalities upon which we have been depending, is to be found in the very deprivations we have so mourned over. God must burn up with the fire of His love every chariot of our own that stands in the way of our mounting into His.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;For, behold, the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. For by fire and by his sword will the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> plead with all flesh: and the slain of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> shall be many.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+66%3A15-16" title="Isaiah 66:15-16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 66:15-16)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Let us be thankful, then, for every trial that will help to destroy our chariots, and will compel us to take refuge in the chariot of God, which stands ready and waiting beside us.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him. He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved. In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God. Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+62%3A5-8" title="Psalm 62:5-8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 62:5-8)</span></a></span></p>

<p>We have to be brought to the place where all other refuges fail us, before we can say,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;He only.&#8221;</span>
We say, &#8220;He&#8212;and something else.&#8221; &#8220;He, and my experience,&#8221; or &#8220;He, and my church relationships,&#8221; or &#8220;He, and my Christian work&#8221;; and all that comes after the &#8220;and&#8221; must be taken away from us, or must be proved useless before we can come to the
<span class="scripture">&#8220;He only.&#8221;</span>
As long as visible chariots are at hand, the soul will not mount into the invisible ones.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+68%3A4" title="Psalm 68:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 68:4)</span></a></span></p>

<p>If we want to ride with God
<span class="scripture">&#8220;upon the heavens,&#8221;</span>
we have to be brought to an end of all riding upon the earth.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+68%3A24" title="Psalm 68:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 68:24)</span></a></span></p>

<p>To see God&#8217;s <span class="scripture">&#8220;goings,&#8221;</span> we must get into the <span class="scripture">&#8220;sanctuary&#8221;</span>
of his presence; and to share in His &#8220;goings&#8221; and &#8220;go&#8221; with Him, we must abandon all earthly &#8220;goings.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Man&#8217;s goings are of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>; how can a man then understand his own way?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+20%3A24" title="Proverbs 20:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 20:24)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+17%3A5" title="Psalm 17:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 17:5)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;I waited patiently for the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+40%3A1-2" title="Psalm 40:1-2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 40:1-2)</span></a></span></p>

<p>When we mount into God&#8217;s chariot our goings are
<span class="scripture">&#8220;established,&#8221;</span>
for no obstacles can hinder its triumphal course. All losses therefore are gains that bring us to this.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+3%3A7-9" title="Philippians 3:7-9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 3:7-9)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Paul understood this, and he gloried in the losses which brought him such unspeakable gain.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+12%3A7-10" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 12:7-10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 12:7-10)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Even the
<span class="scripture">&#8220;thorn in the flesh,&#8221;</span>
the messenger of Satan sent to buffet him, became only a chariot to his willing soul, that carried him to heights of triumph which he could have reached in no other way. To
<span class="scripture">&#8220;take pleasure&#8221;</span>
in one&#8217;s trials, what is this but turning them into the grandest of chariots?</p>

<p>Joseph had a revelation of his future triumphs and reigning, but the chariots that carried him there looked to the eye of sense like the bitterest failures and defeats. It was a strange road to a kingdom, through slavery and a prison, and yet by no other road could Joseph have reached his triumph.
His dream (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+37%3A5-10">Genesis 37:5-10</a>);
his chariots (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+37%3A19-20%2C27-28%3B39%3A19-20">Genesis 37:19-20,27-28;39:19-20</a>);
how he rode in his chariots (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+39%3A1-16%2C+21-23">Genesis 39:1-16, 21-23</a>);
his triumph (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+43%3A38-43">Genesis 43:38-43</a>).</p>

<p>And now a word as to how one is to mount into these chariots.</p>

<p>My answer would be simply this: Find out where God is in each one of them, and hide yourself in Him. Or, in other words, do what the little child does when trouble comest, who finds its mother and hides in her arms. The real chariot after all that takes us through triumphantly is the carrying of God.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+46%3A4" title="Isaiah 46:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 46:4)</span></a></span></p>

<p>The baby carried in the chariot of its mother&#8217;s arms rides triumphantly through the hardest places, and does not even know they are hard.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+63%3A9" title="Isaiah 63:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 63:9)</span></a></span></p>

<p>And how much more we, who are carried in the chariot of the &#8220;arms of God&#8221;!</p>

<p>Get into your chariot, then. Take each thing that is wrong in your lives as God&#8217;s chariot for you. No matter who the builder of the wrong may be, whether men or devils, by the time it reaches your side it is God&#8217;s chariot for you, and is meant to carry you to a heavenly place of triumph. Shut out all the second causes, and find the Lord in it. Say, &#8220;Lord, open my eyes that I may see, not the visible enemy, but thy unseen chariots of deliverance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accept His will in the trial, whatever it may be, and hide yourself in His arms of love. Say, &#8220;Thy will be done; Thy will be done!&#8221; over and over. Shut out every other thought but the one thought of submission to His will and of trust in His love. Make your trial thus your chariot, and you will find your soul &#8220;riding upon the heavens&#8221; with God in a way you never dreamed could be.</p>

<p>I have not a shadow of doubt that if all our eyes were opened today we would see our homes, and our places of business, and the streets we traverse, filled with the
<span class="scripture">&#8220;chariots of God.&#8221;</span>
There is no need for any one of us to walk for lack of chariots. That cross inmate of your household, who has hitherto made life a burden to you, and who has been the Juggernaut car to crush your soul into the dust, may henceforth be a glorious chariot to carry you to the heights of heavenly patience and longsuffering. That misunderstanding, that mortification, that unkindness, that disappointment, that loss, that defeat, all these are chariots waiting to carry you to the very heights of victory you have so longed to reach.</p>

<p>Mount into them, then, with thankful hearts, and lose sight of all second causes in the shining of His love who will &#8220;carry you in His arms&#8221; safely and triumphantly over it all.</p>
