<h1>The Brush Arbor Meeting</h1>

<p>When the afternoon shadows began to lengthen, there began to gather around the new-made brush arbor on Post Oak Ridge a number of men and boys. These were mostly idlers of the community, who had nothing in particular to do, so had come early to the arbor. But when the last faint streaks of the dying day were fading, the more substantial citizens of the community began to gather at this spot of interest. They came from every direction. Every path seemed to lead to the arbor ridge. Some came in wagons, some in buggies, some on horseback, others walked.</p>

<p>Everybody, almost, was there. Grandma Gray was there. She sat serenely in her big willow rocker, which Nolan had placed just in front and to the left of the speaker&#8217;s stand. Her age-wrinkled face was all aglow with the joy of full salvation. Aunt Sally Perkins was there. Poor old Aunt Sally. She was notorious as a shouter and a hypocrite. Nobody had any confidence in her as a Christian, but she was much given to sitting in the &#8220;amen&#8221; corner, and on this particular night she came into the big arbor and deposited her scanty self right on a front bench. And there she sat, wrapped in her old gray shawl, peeping out from beneath her old black bonnet. Old Brother Bunk was there. For a quarter of a century he had been a true and tried member of Mount Olivet Church, but of late he had been much wrought upon by the holiness agitation. &#8220;Spooky&#8221; Crane was there. Crane was a harmless half-wit who lived alone in a shanty at the back of Deacon Gramps&#8217; field. He always made it a point to attend every religious service far and near, of whatever faith, and he had the capacity for adjusting himself to his surroundings to such an extent that he joined every religious movement with which he came in contact. Roguish boys found great amusement in giving him pennies to sing for them. Jim Peabody was there. But that was to be taken only as a matter of course, for Jim always went to church. He went, not because he was religious, but because he was otherwise. He made loud boast of his infidelity. He had given himself extensively to the reading of Bob Ingersoll and other authors notorious for things other than goodness, so in his own vain imaginations he was a masterful scholar. He said there was no God, and that any man who prayed was a fool. But the cause of infidelity had suffered a terrific blow when one time Nolan Gray, as he was going to Dobbinsville, saw a huge wagon-box turned bottom side up, with the wagon on top, in a ditch by the side of the road. As he drew near he heard coming from under the box the low muttering tones of a man&#8217;s voice. As he stood near the box and listened he heard a most eloquent prayer. He took a long pole from a fence near by and pried one edge of the box up, and who should emerge from beneath but Jim Peabody.</p>

<p>When the hour of service arrived, Jake Benton and the evangelistic party did not arrive with it. Owing to the lateness of the train, Jake had been unable to get around at the appointed hour. Finally the familiar rattle of Jake&#8217;s wagon was heard, and now all was breathless expectancy. When the party arrived at the arbor, all eyes were fastened upon the Evangelist. If he had been a ghost moving about in the twilight of that summer evening, he would have been regarded with no more superstition by that rustic people. There was nothing whatsoever extraordinary in the physical appearance of Evangelist Blank. He was a man of average height and scant weight. His rather pallid face was covered with a scanty, well-trimmed beard. His deep-set blue eyes sparkled with a pleasant earnestness. Any lack of physical attractiveness was amply atoned for by the splendid qualities of the man&#8217;s soul. He was a mighty man of God. He had an unusual grip on the upper world. He had large capacities for moving God on His throne. A heavenly atmosphere pervaded the realm of his personality.</p>

<p>When this man stepped onto the platform of the large brush arbor that summer evening, and took his seat and faced that audience, there was a stillness that was painful. The awful stillness was broken when the Evangelist arose and said, &#8220;Praise God for His matchless salvation.&#8221; He made a few preliminary remarks and the corp of singers began to sing. And such music seldom issues from human lips. It was not overwhelming in point of its artistic qualities. The compositions were of the simplest sort. But the singers sang from out of the abundance of redeemed souls, and there was a heavenly inspiration accompanying the songs that simply overwhelmed the hearts of sinners and overjoyed the hearts of saints. One song that especially gripped the audience ran thus:</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Do you triumph, oh, my brother,<br />Over all this world of sin?<br />In each storm of tribulation,<br />Does your Jesus reign within?</p>

<p class="verse refrain_line">Refrain:</p><p class="verse refrain">&#8220;I am reigning, sweetly reigning,<br />Far above this world of strife;<br />In my blessed, loving Savior,<br />I am reigning in this life.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Reigning_in_This_Life/index.html" title="Reigning in This Life">*</a></p>

<p>When this and several other hymns equally inspiring had been sung, Evangelist Blank arose and said, &#8220;Let us pray.&#8221; At this the audience began to make arrangements to stand, for it was the custom in Mount Olivet Church in those days to stand while the preacher &#8220;made&#8221; his prayer, as Deacon Gramps expressed it. But the Evangelist had the notion that when the heart is humbled before God the body should be in a like position, so he reverently and unpretentiously knelt beside the rough board pulpit. The four singers on the platform knelt simultaneously with the Evangelist. This placed the members of Mount Olivet in a rather embarrassing position. They disliked the idea of being so irreverent as to sit erect during prayer, and they could not bear the humiliation of kneeling at a holiness meeting. A few of them under the press of the circumstance did kneel. A few stood up. Most of them sat with bowed heads. &#8220;Spooky&#8221; Crane easily adjusted himself to the situation and promptly knelt in the straw, and with his face in his hands peeped between his fingers at the Evangelist. Jim Peabody, the infidel, sat arrogantly erect with an impish snarl on his lip. To him the whole business of praying was a huge piece of foolishness&#8212;except, of course, when under the wagon-box. Aunt Sally Perkins knelt beside the front bench and clapped her hands hysterically during the prayer. And Deacon Gramps had slipped under the outer edge of the arbor, where he sat on a low bench with his elbows on his knees and chewed his tobacco most vigorously.</p>

<p>Evangelist Blank, himself, led in prayer. His prayer, like himself, was simple, but mighty. It ran something like this:</p>

<p>&#8220;0 Lord of heaven and earth, we thank Thee for this hour. We have come here in Thy name; we plead no worthiness and no efficiency of our own. Thy blood and Thy grace is all our plea. We would not thrust ourselves into Thy holy presence on any human merits. But in Thy name and through the blood of Christ our Savior we come boldly before Thee. We praise Thee, Lord, for Thy great salvation, by which thou dost save us and sanctify us. 0 Lord, make Thyself mighty in the salvation of this people among whom we have come to labor. Let Thy matchless power be manifested and Thy righteous name be exalted. Be Thou lifted up before the people. Lord, we rededicate ourselves at this hour to be used of Thee in the salvation of men. Come into these temples of clay afresh at this hour, 0 Lord, and let the fire of Thy holy presence consume all the dross that may be in us. Anoint our feeble lips to speak the unsearchable riches of Christ&#8230;. Hear us, Lord, we ask in Jesus&#8217; name. Amen.&#8221;</p>

<p>This prayer made a profound impression on the audience. When it was finished, a few other songs were sung, and then Evangelist Blank arose to address the audience. There was something about the preaching and personality of this man that made him a unique figure in the field of preacherdom. In the first place, he was masterful in his knowledge and use of the Holy Scriptures. He knew God&#8217;s Book. By patient study and long practice he had brought himself to the place where he could readily bring to his defense an impregnable line of Scriptural proof to sustain the propositions that he held. He was not only proficient in the Scriptures, but he had a thorough training covering the whole range of ministerial and theological thought. He had the happy and unusual combination of those qualities of mind that make for forceful oratory and clearness in theological thought. And last, and far from least, he walked with God. He had a yearning for the lost of earth&#8217;s millions.</p>

<p>On that evening when he faced for the first time his brush-arbor audience, it was plainly to be seen that he did not lack for something to say. He did not let his sermon get in the way of his message. He went right to the heart of his subject, which he announced as Salvation. He took for his text <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+2%3A11-12">Titus 2:11-12</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8220;For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>His sermon ran partly thus: &#8220;My friends and brethren, we are here this evening to conduct this service in the fear of God. Almost a year ago I received a letter from Brother Benton urging me to come to his place to hold a revival. Owing to my many calls, I was unable to come until the present time, and now at last we are here in the name of God. We expect Him to give us a gracious outpouring of His Holy Spirit. The text that I have read in your hearing introduces my subject, the subject of Salvation. I feel the burden of this message pressing upon my heart. Since Jesus saved me from a life of sin I have had a consuming desire to get others to press their way into this grand experience. I shall not promise to keep within the bounds of homiletical order tonight, but I do promise to keep within the bounds of God&#8217;s Holy Word and the leadings of His Spirit.&#8221; These introductory remarks were stated with a simple earnestness born of a desire to see men saved.</p>

<p>The evangelist first proceeded to show what salvation is. He said it is a divine work of grace in the heart, wrought by the blood of Jesus Christ. He explained that it means deliverance from sin. He said that if the Bible teaches anything at all, it teaches that the individual must have a vital connection with Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Next the evangelist set forth the conditions of salvation. &#8220;First,&#8221; he said, &#8220;a man must be sorry for his sins; secondly, he must repent of his sins; and, thirdly, he must forsake his sins.</p>

<p>He dwelt at great length on the effects of salvation in the heart. He said that if a man&#8217;s religion did not have any effect on him, it was worthless. A man&#8217;s religion must make him a new creature, he argued. He declared that salvation makes a man love even his enemies. He said salvation cleanses a man from inward and outward filth.</p>

<p>By the time Evangelist Blank had illustrated and amplified all his points he had consumed the major portion of an hour and a half of time. During this time the entire audience was held spellbound by his simple and earnest eloquence.</p>

<p>All this was strange theology to the members of Mount Olivet Church. It was a stinging rebuke to their crooked and hypocritical lives.</p>
