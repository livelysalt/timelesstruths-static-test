<h1>Escape in the Night</h1>

<p>During the time that Bonds was on the floor, Evangelist Blank leaned against the pulpit with his face in his hands as if in prayer. When Bonds sat down the Evangelist calmly faced the audience. Just at this time he seemed to possess the meekness of a lamb and the boldness of a lion. He seemed perfectly composed, as he remarked, &#8220;Well, brethren and friends, I am indeed sorry to see this splendid testimony meeting end in this way. I am sorry the ministerial brother feels as he does toward the truth we have preached, and I hope after prayer and reflection he will see his way clear not to hinder the progress of the meeting. However, if God sees fit to allow the hand of persecution to fall upon us, we bow submissively to His will. But we will not, we dare not compromise God&#8217;s truth. We will preach the Bible regardless of consequences.&#8221; With these remarks Evangelist Blank closed the service.</p>

<p>After the service was closed everything seemed to be as usual except for a few whisperings around in regard to what Preacher Bonds had said. As was usually the case at the close of such meetings, the saints gathered in little groups about the front end of the arbor and talked freely of their common faith and love. Mothers began to arouse sleepy-eyed children from their dreams and break to them the sad news that they were not at home in bed. Bushy-headed, bearded farmers and woodsmen began ramming their grimy hands into the hip pockets of their &#8220;blue drillin&#8217; overhauls,&#8221; in which sequestered quarters they were prone to hide their &#8220;long twist&#8221; and homemade cob pipes. After injecting an ample amount of &#8220;long twist&#8221; into the cob pipe&#8217;s empty stomach and lighting a match thereto and sending a few initiatory puffs into the air, these mountaineers made off in the darkness toward their homes in different directions. Some went in groups, some by twos, some singly. Seen from a distance in the blackness of the night these companies resembled a regiment of glow-worms in a potato patch. From over the flint hills in the distance came the familiar rattle and rumble of old-fashioned lumber wagons whose occupants had come far to hear the much-discussed preacher from &#8220;over east.&#8221; Now and then the night air was pierced by hideous yells and whistles from roguish boys dashing along on horseback, whose popularity depended on the amount of noise they made.</p>

<p>Is the offense of the cross ceased? Nay, verily; they that <span class="scripture">&#8220;live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+3%3A12" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 3:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 3:12)</span></a></span> So say the Scriptures, and so thought Evangelist Blank as he lay down to rest that night after he had closed the testimony-meeting. Evangelist Blank slept in a tent, which had been pitched near the brush arbor. Several such tents had been pitched by Jake Benton and other neighbors, who, finding it ill convenient to go to and from the meeting each night, had decided to run it somewhat on the camp meeting plan.</p>

<p>On the particular night of which we have been speaking, Evangelist Blank from some cause unknown to him was awakened shortly after midnight. Not being able to resume sleep, he thought to improve even the midnight time by musing on the goodness of God. As he lay thus gazing through the thin canvas of his tent at the moon, which was now a two hour&#8217;s journey in the sky, he was startled by the sight of a man&#8217;s shadow on the side of the tent. He lay still and listened. Soon he heard low muttering voices a few rods from his tent. Still he listened. They drew nearer and nearer. Finally the mutterings became whisperings. Still he listened, and prayed. They came nearer. Soon several shadows were cast on the canvas. He saw the winding shadow of a rope as it dangled from the arms of one of the men. Still he listened. Still they whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;No difference about Benton, we want the preacher,&#8221; he heard one say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure this is his tent?&#8221; whispered another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw him sitting in this tent&#8217;s door reading this afternoon,&#8221; whispered a third.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must get the rope on him and make away with him before the camp is aroused,&#8221; someone said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall I do?&#8221; thought the pious man. &#8220;Does it mean that I must suffer death at the hands of this mob, simply because I have preached the truth? Will they hang me? Will they choke me? Will they stone me? Will they drag me over these awful rocks until life is dashed out? What meant the gleam in Bonds&#8217; eyes last night in the service? What will become of my dear wife and boy in Ohio? Will I recant? Will I deny my Lord? Will I shun to declare the whole counsel of God?&#8221; All these questions and many others flashed across the Evangelist&#8217;s mind like angry streaks of lightning across a black cloud.</p>

<p>Through the thin canvas he saw in the moonlight half a dozen husky men seize hold of one end of a rope, the other end of which was arranged in a slip-loop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now when I get the rope on him, make for the hills,&#8221; said one man as he began to untie the strings that held the door of the tent. Just at this instant Evangelist Blank slipped under the edge of the tent on the opposite side from where the men were planning their diabolical feat, and under the edge of Jake Benton&#8217;s tent, which stood just about two feet from his own. With a quickness of mind that was almost miraculous, he donned a dress and shawl and bonnet belonging to Sister Benton, and stole out of the tent and across the ground toward the arbor in full view of the enraged men as they came out of the tent that he had just vacated.</p>

<p>The men were as much astonished as enraged at not finding their prey. They ransacked Jake Benton&#8217;s tent and demanded that he reveal the whereabouts of the preacher. Jake flatly refused. Except for his trembling, he stood like a stone wall and faced that score of masked men, thirsty for righteous blood. Really they appeared as so many thoroughbred devils right from the pit. They were masked in a way, not only to conceal their identity, but in a way to make them appear as hideous as possible. The leader of the mob shouted, &#8220;Jake Benton, you sanctified hypocrite, if you don&#8217;t tell us where that preacher is we&#8217;ll hang your carcass up for the crows to pick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you will, but I&#8217;ll hang there, before I&#8217;ll tell,&#8221; shouted poor Jake in a trembling voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was that ole lady left your tent and went across the ground a while ago with a bonnet on?&#8221; shouted one of the mob.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw an ole lady going across the ground,&#8221; replied Jake, truthfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang him up to a tree boys, hang him up, if he won&#8217;t tell,&#8221; shouted one of the gang. &#8220;Bring the rope,&#8221; shouted another as he took hold of Benton&#8217;s arms.</p>

<p>Just at this juncture the leader of the mob suggested to Jake that if he and his comrades would break up camp and leave the ground immediately, they would not hang him, but would continue their search for the Evangelist. To this Jake and the whole party of campers readily agreed. In the light of the moon, the whole ground of campers, consisting of more than a dozen families, hitched their teams to their wagons and made their way over the hills homeward. Before any wagon was allowed to leave the ground, it was carefully searched by the mob to ascertain whether or not Evangelist Blank were there. He could not be found.</p>

<p>When old Brother Bunk and his family arrived at their home, which was two miles from the campground. Sister Bunk and the Bunk children were afraid to go into the house until Brother Bunk should unharness the team and go with them. When the Bunk family came to the yard, they were astonished to see in the moonlight somebody sitting under the old silver poplar-tree. They were scared to say the least. Sister Bunk and the Bunk children hovered closer and closer to Brother Bunk, while fear increased as the distance to the poplar-tree decreased. Imagine their surprise and relief when the person under the tree shouted, &#8220;Praise God, Brother Bunk, many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth them out of them all.&#8221; It was Evangelist Blank. He explained to them that he had walked the whole two miles from the camp through the woods, guided by the sound of the wagon, thus avoiding the possibility of being apprehended by the mob in case they should attack the wagon. He had arrived at the Bunk farm about the same time as the wagon had, but not having the inconvenience of a team to attend to, had sat down under the tree to rest.</p>

<p>The mob naturally supposed that Evangelist Blank would somehow make his way from the campground to Jake Benton&#8217;s. Benton and his family arrived home from the camp about three o&#8217;clock in the morning. They had been there only half an hour when they were aroused by the shout of the mob, who demanded that the preacher should be yielded up to them. Not until they had thoroughly searched Benton&#8217;s home would they believe Jake&#8217;s contention that Evangelist Blank was not on the premises. Finally, when they were convinced that Benton could not or would not tell them where the preacher was they withdrew to a clump of woods a short distance from Benton&#8217;s home and, the morning air being chilly, built a fire.</p>

<p>It was here that their identity became known. As they chatted around the fire they removed the masks from their faces. Of course, Jake Benton was curious to know who they were, and when he saw their fire in the woods he resolved to find out, even at the expense of much trembling. He thought he had recognized some of them by their voices when they talked to him at the camp, but now he determined to make sure. He crawled on his hands and knees for nearly a quarter of a mile along an old rail fence until he came within a distance of twenty rods from where the men were gathered, Indian fashion, around the fire. He was not at all surprised when he saw in the group the familiar face of Deacon Gramps and Reverend Bonds. And he observed from certain parts of their masks which they still had on that these two men were the fellows who took the leading part in the affair at the camp. Jake recognized that the group was made up mostly of men who were prominent members of Mount Olivet church. A few non-church-members and young men of the baser sort were also in the group. Benton watched them until nearly daybreak, when they disbanded and started for home. Jake lay quietly in his clump of buck-brush until he was sure that they were at a safe distance, then he crawled out and went home, informed much and scared more.</p>

<p>Shortly after sunrise, old Brother Bunk came over to tell Benton that Evangelist Blank was at his house safe, and happy in the Lord. This news greatly relieved Benton and his good wife, for they had not seen the Evangelist since he left their tent during the night, and they did not know just how he was faring. Evangelist Blank had suggested that it be announced that as this was Sunday there would be services held that day at old Brother Bunk&#8217;s. This idea pleased Benton, and he joined Brother Bunk in scattering the news among the saints. Accordingly at eleven o&#8217;clock the saints gathered at the Bunk home, where a blessed meeting was held. Great power and victory prevailed. The awful persecution had driven the saints to their knees in prayer. The very atmosphere round about seemed to be charged with the Holy Spirit&#8217;s power. Evangelist Blank started to preach, but found it impossible. The saints shouted him down. A number of sinners who were present melted under the influence of the Holy Spirit and yielded their hearts to God. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Great grace was upon them all.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+4%3A33" title="Acts 4:33"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 4:33)</span></a></span></p>

<p>That night the meeting at the arbor was resumed, and it continued for two weeks with greater victory and power than before the molestation. The mob never bothered again, and the reason was this: a dozen or more men in the community who were sinners, and professed to be sinners, but who believed that men should be allowed to serve God according to the dictates of their own consciences, simply made it plain that the first fellows masked or unmasked who should disturb the meeting would be dealt with in a most uncomplimentary manner. The mob saw the situation in its true light and decided that for their own safety they would stay away.</p>

<p>When the meeting finally ran its natural course and came to a close, Evangelist Blank bade the band of saints a loving and tearful farewell and betook himself to other fields to suffer and rejoice in the great work with which God had entrusted him.</p>
