<h1>A Funeral</h1>

<p>Five years had flitted by since Jake Ben ton was converted down in the hills. The battle between holiness and sin-you-must religion had waxed hotter and hotter. Masked mobs had scoured the country at different times, threatening the very lives of enemies. The sin-you-must group had decreased in number, but had increased in wickedness. It could truthfully be said that every member of Mount Olivet church was at this time a positive force for evil. The membership had dwindled to one-fourth its former size. Somebody is responsible for the statement that the blackest deeds known to the world have been done in the name of religion, love, and liberty. Mount Olivet Church did her blackest deeds in the name of religion. She was determined to crush her adversaries, and she was not particular as to the means she used. Every member who had even the tiniest spark of God&#8217;s love in his heart had either cast his lot with the holiness movement or given up his religious profession altogether. Preacher Bonds had grown more and more zealous in his fight against holiness.</p>

<p>Deacon Gramps had preached his doctrine everywhere, in his home as well as in the church, and he had already seen its fruits manifested right in his home. One of his sons who had now become of age had built a sort of philosophy of life on his father&#8217;s teaching. He had reasoned something like this: &#8220;Since Father sins, and Mother sins, and the preacher sins, and everybody else sins, and nobody can keep from sinning, then it follows that one is not responsible for the sins he commits, whether they be large or small, few or many. Then why not have a good time in this life? Why not go the full length into sinful pleasure?&#8221; And go the full length he did. He had become involved in one criminal scrape after another, and he would have landed in the penitentiary before this time had it not been for Deacon Gramps&#8217; financial backing. And by this time it had come to be common knowledge in the community that the son&#8217;s profligacy was almost certain to involve the Deacon in financial ruin. It was a fact much discussed in inner business circles at Dobbinsville that Mr. Gramps&#8217; farm was heavily mortgaged, and that unless some crook or turn unforeseen favored him he would soon face bankruptcy. He had been unable to pay the interest on the notes he had been obliged to obtain in order to keep his son from going where he really belonged.</p>

<p>As for Jake Benton, during these five years since his conversion, his poverty had stuck closer to him than a brother; but thanks be to his persecutions, he had grown immensely rich in spiritual resources. He had become a mighty man in prayer. The sick were healed in answer to his prayer of simple faith. And it seemed only a natural thing for him to pray for his enemies. And as for love, Jake loved everybody and everybody had found it out. If anybody in the community wanted a favor done them, all that was necessary was to mistreat Benton and he would do them a favor. He had also developed into quite a preacher. Ever since the meeting closed in the brush arbor he regularly gathered the saints together on Sunday in the school house, and encouraged them in the things of the Lord. His life was simply exemplary, and even his bitterest enemies were compelled to acknowledge that God was with him.</p>

<p>One Sunday morning when Preacher Bonds stood before his meager audience, the familiar face of Deacon Gramps was absent. His unusual absence from the Church was very noticeable, and Preacher Bonds suggested in the introductory remarks of his sermon that unquestionably Brother Gramps was sick, and that it would be an act of brotherly kindness if when the service was over a number of the members would call at the Gramps&#8217; home and see the sick brother.</p>

<p>When Preacher Bonds had finished his sermon, a song had been sung, and the benediction had been invoked, a dozen or more of the members with Bonds in the lead started for the Gramps&#8217; home, which, as will be remembered, was plainly visible from the church.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe,&#8221; said Bonds, &#8220;that Brother Gramps&#8217; barn is on fire.&#8221; At this the whole group began to rush toward the beautiful red barn that stood a quarter of a mile away. By the time they reached the spot, black clouds of smoke and angry flames were shooting from doors and cracks in the barn. Mrs. Gramps and the three children who were still at home were in the barnyard wringing their hands and crying in a heart-rending manner. It was plainly to be seen that the visitors could do nothing to save the barn, and all that remained to do was to stand and watch the flames devour the building.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Brother Gramps?&#8221; said Preacher Bonds to Mrs. Gramps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t he at church? No? Well, I don&#8217;t know where he can be. He left the house just at church time and I hadn&#8217;t noticed but what he was in the crowd that came from the church,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>Preacher Bonds looked serious as he said, &#8220;He could not have been in the barn, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, certainly not. I suppose he must be at some of the neighbors&#8217;, perhaps Deacon Brown&#8217;s&#8212;was Deacon Brown at church?&#8221; &#8220;No, Deacon Brown was not at church,&#8221; replied Bonds. &#8220;Possibly he remained at home and Brother Gramps went to see him on some business pertaining to the church. But I don&#8217;t understand why they did not meet at the church to transact their business. Brother Jones, will you run over to Deacon Brown&#8217;s and tell Brother Gramps about his awful accident?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; responded Jones, who stood near the barnyard gate talking with Gramps&#8217; hired hand, from whom he was endeavoring to learn the details as to how the fire started.</p>

<p>&#8220;Try to tell him,&#8221; remarked Bonds, &#8220;in a way that will not be too much of a shock to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jones mounted a horse and hurried off to Deacon Brown&#8217;s and was soon back with the news that Gramps had not been seen at Brown&#8217;s, and that Brown was sick in bed, which fact accounted for his being absent from the service that morning.</p>

<p>When it was learned that Gramps was not at Deacon Brown&#8217;s, considerable anxiety began to be manifested on the part of neighbors. Some suggested that it was possible that Gramps could have been in the barn when it burned. Of course, care was exercised that such remarks should not reach the ears of Mrs. Gramps. Messages were sent to all the neighbors in search of Gramps. Someone had the idea that possibly he had gone to Dobbinsville or Ridgetown, but searchers sent to these places reported that he had not been seen at either place for several days. Preacher Bonds consoled Mrs. Gramps with the suggestion that doubtless he would show up before night. However, when night came with no signs of Deacon Gramps the whole community took an attitude of real alarm as to the likelihood that he had been burned to death. It was announced that there would be no meeting services at Mount Olivet Church, and Jake Benton dismissed his services and joined heartily in the search for the Deacon, who had dealt him so many grievous blows, while Mrs. Benton did everything in her power to console Mrs. Gramps.</p>

<p>The search continued all through the night with no results. By early Monday morning there was general excitement for miles around. Scores of people came that morning from Dobbinsville and Ridgetown, and gazed on the mysterious scene of the former beautiful barn, now an ash heap. Officers came down from the county seat and joined in the search for the lost Deacon. About the middle of the afternoon on Monday it was decided that the ash-heap should be searched for any evidence that the man had burned with the barn. This search had not gone far when the county sheriff found in the ashes the steel back-springs and blades of a pocket-knife. Near by were found some pieces of enamel resembling a man&#8217;s teeth. Next was found a small melted mass of something which seemed to have been a suspender buckle. Preacher Bonds picked up three pieces of silver which proved to have been so many silver dollars. Several pieces of bones were found, but these were so nearly charred to dust that it was impossible to determine whether they were bones of a man or bones of some of the many animals that perished with the building. However, all these articles mentioned were found within a very close proximity to each other, and in the minds of most people present there was now no doubt as to the fate of Deacon Gramps. On Monday night the coroner rendered a verdict that the Deacon met his death by being accidentally burned to death. Mrs. Gramps swooned away and had to have the attention of old Doctor Greenwich from Dobbinsville. In the event of the illness of Mrs. Gramps, it devolved upon Preacher Bonds to make full arrangements for the funeral, in which affair Jake Benton and his good wife showed every disposition to help where help was possible.</p>

<p>Preacher Bonds went to Dobbinsville and sent a telegram to each of the Deacon&#8217;s five sons, two of whom lived in St. Louis, and three in Chicago. He also sent a telegram to a minister in St. Louis to come to preach the funeral, as, he said, he did not feel that he could officiate at the funeral of such a worthy brother as the departed. This St. Louis preacher had been a college chum of Preacher Bonds, and was full of the Mount Olivet persuasion.</p>

<p>Those were in the days before undertakers and other such modern conveniences had been introduced into that country. Jake Benton, good soul, went to Dobbinsville after the coffin and hauled it back in the same old lumber wagon he had hauled Evangelist Blank in four years before.</p>

<p>The funeral was arranged for Wednesday afternoon at two o&#8217;clock. A handful of ashes, together with the pocket-knife and other articles found in the ash-heap, was taken and wrapped in a napkin and placed in the big new coffin.</p>

<p>On Wednesday afternoon, when two o&#8217;clock arrived, the two front rooms of the Gramps farmhouse were crammed full of people. The yard was full, too. The St. Louis preacher began and spoke thus: &#8220;My friends and brethren, we have met on this sad occasion to pay our last respects to the honored dead. Within the narrow confines of this casket lie the earthly remains of a man whose spirit yet lives. It was not my happy privilege to know this excellent man, but I am informed by his pastor, Preacher Bonds here, of his manifold excellencies. When a great man dies, the people mourn. I am informed that our departed brother was a great man. First, he was a great man in business. When I behold this beautiful, well-kept farm, I see its wide, extending fields, its running brooks, its whitewashed fences, its excellent buildings, in the burning of one of which our brother met his death&#8212;when I behold these things, I say, I am made to exclaim that God hath blessed him in basket and store. Yes, a great man in business.</p>

<p>&#8220;Secondly, he was a great man in his home, and by the way, there is where the true greatness of a man is tested. In the death of our esteemed brother the home is the loser. It loses a loving husband. It loses a considerate father and an efficient bread-winner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirdly, our brother was a great man in the community. I am told that he was a public-spirited man. He believed in schools, in good roads, and in all other things that make for the welfare of a community. In his death the community is a heavy loser.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fourthly, he was a great man in the church.&#8221; (&#8220;Amen,&#8221; said Preacher Bonds.) &#8220;I am told that for upwards of thirty years our brother has been a consistent member of Mount Olivet Church and a regular attendant at its service and a heavy contributor to its funds. I understand that he was a mighty defender of the church&#8217;s faith. He fought bravely on. He stood like a rock. He weathered the storm. He finished the course. He conquered.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my friends, our finite minds cannot fathom the profound mysteries of the infinite. We cannot understand. Why would a just God permit such a noble man to meet such a tragic death? It is not ours to reason why. We simply bow our hearts to the will of the divine.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, to the bereaved I would say, Weep not as those who have no hope.&#8221; (Mrs. Gramps was weeping aloud.) &#8220;Brother Gramps is just gone on before. He has crossed over Jordan, where he waits on the sunny banks of sweet deliverance. Just a few more days and we shall join him. He has gone where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary be at rest. Let us pray. Brother Bonds, lead us.&#8221;</p>
