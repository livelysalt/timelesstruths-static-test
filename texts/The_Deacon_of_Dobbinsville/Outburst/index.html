<h1>Outburst</h1>

<p>It was about the fifth night of the big holiness meeting at the arbor on Post Oak Ridge. The country was stirred for miles around. People from Dobbinsville and Ridgetown and neighboring villages were in regular attendance. Scores of people had been converted. Many had been sanctified. Numbers had been healed. The forces of sin were enraged. Wicked men, grim with age, had melted like frost at noonday under the mighty preaching of the Spirit-filled evangelist. Old women with lying hearts and gossiping lips had been stricken down in mighty and pungent conviction for their sins. Young men, roguish and rough and stout-hearted, had come to the old split-log altar and on penitent knees had sobbed out before God the awful sins of their hearts and had gone away happy with the new-found treasure of full salvation. Young ladies, vain and haughty, had melted under the gospel messages and had come to the feet of Jesus. Sweet children not yet in their teens had wept their childish transgressions away, and in their simple faith had accepted Jesus as their Savior. Oh, the grand and glorious gospel! How matchless is its power.</p>

<p>Well, as I said, it was about the fifth night of the meeting. Preacher Bonds was there, and had been the two nights preceding. He had regarded all the manifestations of God&#8217;s power in the meetings with affected indifference. He said he hated holiness and would hate it as long as he lived. On being asked what he thought of the miraculous conversions that had taken place in the meeting, he remarked that he would not believe in holiness even if Beelzebub himself were converted in the meetings.</p>

<p>Evangelist Blank said he thought this would be a splendid time to have a testimony-meeting. So they had one, and he conducted it himself. Grandma Gray was the first to testify. She stood trembling, and balanced herself against the back of the old willow rocker. Around her saintly face there seemed to circle a halo of glory. At first she only stood and wept. When she had gained control of her emotions sufficiently to speak, she said, &#8220;Oh, the love of God is unspeakable. How can I praise Him for what He has done for me? He saves me and sanctifies me and heals me. I praise Him for sending Evangelist Blank here. I would not say a word against the people of Mount Olivet Church, but for thirty-some years I lived in that church an up-and-down life. God knows I wanted to live for Him all that time but my experience was not sufficient to keep me. But since I have learned of the more perfect way, how my heart rejoices in this full salvation. Since this meeting began, the good Lord has been showing me great light on the church question. I see the one body of Christ, which is the church. I have just learned that I was born into the real, true church thirty-some years ago. O brethren, the day is dawning, the light is shining. How glad I am that I have lived to see this day.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Grandma Gray had well-nigh exhausted her feeble strength in exhorting the people to come to Jesus and accept His truth, she sank into her big willow chair and silently prayed. For a brief period there was a deathlike stillness over the audience.</p>

<p>For years Grandma Gray had lived a life that could not be gainsaid. True, she spoke in her testimony about her up-and-down life, but when compared with the average professed Christian&#8217;s life in that community, hers was above reproach. In her extreme age she spoke as one from the border-lands of eternity, and her words naturally had a profound effect.</p>

<p>Jake Benton was next to testify. He was simply overwhelmed with joy, and spoke at some length of his hope of someday being reunited with his darling girl in the skies. Jake&#8217;s testimony scattered enthusiasm all through the congregation of the saints and there was rejoicing and praising God that was doubtless participated in by the angels around the throne.</p>

<p>Little flaxen-haired Eva Gray, eleven-year-old daughter of Nolan Gray, arose and said that Jesus had saved her and that she aimed to spend her life for Him, as had Grandma Gray. Thus we see a godly life is fruitful of influence even on the lives of little children.</p>

<p>Probably the most remarkable testimony given was that of Squire Branson. Branson spoke thus: &#8220;Friends and brothers: I stand before you a redeemed man. I am washed and made white in the blood of Jesus. I am as a brand snatched from the burning. I am now in my eighty-third year. You know the manner of my life up until this meeting. I have had absolutely nothing to do with religion. As you know I have lived a life of great wickedness. I have been a drunkard, a gambler&#8212;a mighty sinner. For fifty-three years I had not gone near a church service until this meeting began. I have been thoroughly put out with the type of Christianity exhibited in this community these past years. But when through sheer curiosity I came into this arbor, I was made as conscious of the presence of the Holy Ghost as if I could have seen Him with my natural eyes. There at that altar night before last I unburdened my heart of the sins of nearly eighty years, and I stand tonight a witness of the redeeming grace and love of Christ my Savior. Oh, how can I praise Him enough? Here I stand right at the threshold of death with a long and wasted life behind me and an eternity of bliss before me. What but the mercy of an infinite God could bring about this wonderful change?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spooky&#8221; Crane said in his testimony that of all the churches he had ever belonged to this one was the best. Aunt Sally Perkins shouted.</p>

<p>Evangelist Blank was just ready to close the meeting when he was interrupted by Preacher Bonds. Bonds&#8217; face was red with rage and his eyes gleaming with anger when he burst forth in this unceremonious manner:</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank God for a sensible and reasonable religion. I have been a Christian for thirty years and a minister for twenty years and I have never experienced any of this wonderful joy that these people speak of. This sanctified holiness doctrine is the most damnable doctrine that ever struck this country, or any other country. I knew a group of these holiness people back in Kentucky where I came from. They said they could not sin and that they were just as good as Jesus Christ Himself. They were given to all sorts of fanatical projects. They claimed to have great faith and went so far as to say they were healed, as some of these people have said tonight. One of them even said that by faith he had caused an iron wedge to float on the water. Talk about living free from sin. There never could be a more crooked doctrine preached. The Bible plainly says, <span class="scripture">&#8216;There is none that doeth good, no, not one.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+3%3A12" title="Romans 3:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 3:12)</span></a></span> It also says that &#8216;If a man liveth and saith he sinneth not, he is a liar and the truth is not in him.&#8217; I believe the Bible. When I was in college old Professor Thorridike used to give us an occasional lecture on the Hellish Heresy of Holiness. He knew all about the doctrine and the harm it is doing these days. I am bold to say right here that God has called me and raised me up to fight holiness, and I have dedicated my life to this cause. I aim to use every means, fair and foul, to stamp this doctrine out of this community.&#8221; (&#8220;Amen,&#8221; said Deacon Gramps.) &#8220;I want to warn Preacher Blank and every one of his dupes right here that if he continues to preach in this community he does so at his own peril. You people have no right, legal or moral, to come here and disturb the peace and tranquility of Mount Olivet Church, a church that has stood standpat for nearly half a century in defense of the truth. I here and now call upon every loyal member to come to the defense of the faith of your fathers. Those who will pledge their united support to the cause of stamping out holiness rise to your feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this a score and a half of rustic mountaineers boldly stood up. &#8220;Let those who have made this solemn pledge meet me at the back door of the arbor,&#8221; said Bonds as he sat down.</p>
