<h1>Stay By the Landmarks</h1>

<p>I heard a minister, in his message a while back, say that when he and his wife were first married, he sat down with her and asked her if she ever intended to divorce him. She was in the height of ecstasy of her newly-married joy, and of course the answer was &#8220;No.&#8221; He told her that he never intended to divorce her either, but cautioned that they never take the first step in that direction. He exhorted that they never go to sleep at night with anything existing between them that might have come up during that day. If they kept everything cleared up as they went along and never let a misunderstanding exist overnight, their marriage would certainly never end in the divorce court. He explained to her that it was not the big things which brought married couples to the divorce courts, but just an accumulation of small things and misunderstandings, etc., which summed up to a big thing. This same thing applies to what I am dealing with here, and that is just the way things develop in apostatizing from the truth&#8212;just one little thing after another resulting in a great mountain.</p>

<p>I believe that was real good advice from this minister and his wife, for myself and you and everyone else, and I believe it is good advice in this case: <b>never take the first step toward compromise</b>.</p>

<p>Now in concluding, let me earnestly exhort all brethren in Christ that we all stand fast in one mind, striving for the faith of the gospel, and that we all present a solid front against the enemy and stand solidly together to defend the church and the succeeding generations against the innovations of worldly things which today are hammering at our gates trying to push in upon us. Let us see to it that no bounds are removed and no landmarks are destroyed and no corner stones of truth are moved out of their places, and let us all earnestly contend together for the faith which was once delivered to the saints. Let us first of all contend for this faith within ourselves that we may possess within us the fullness of this faith with all its fruits, its personal regenerating power, its sanctifying power, its gifts of the Spirit, its unifying power and influence, its personal relationship with God, its miracle-working power and that we may all abound in the fullness of divine love and grace in our personal lives. Let us dig deep in the wells of our fathers, and God will surely bless us to be able to meet the problems of our day and overcome them and move on for God.</p>
