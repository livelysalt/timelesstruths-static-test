<h1>Test of Obedience</h1>

<p>Daniel was wiping off the table when Mom came into the kitchen. &#8220;Irene, I need to get some errands done and I&#8217;m taking the girls along,&#8221; she said, picking up her purse from the kitchen table. &#8220;The house needs cleaning up&#8212;especially that hall closet. Kyle&#8217;s down for his nap, so maybe you could do something with that bag of apples, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Irene didn&#8217;t say anything, so Daniel just gave her a big grin as he tossed the dish rag in the sink. But as he slipped into the hall he heard Mom say, &#8220;And Daniel, I need you to help out this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Help out? He always helped out! Daniel frowned as he watched his younger sisters follow Mom out the door. The room was suddenly quiet and Daniel ducked into the shadow of the utility room. He would go see if Chad needed any help outside first.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up, Bud?&#8221; Chad asked, looking up from the board he was sanding. Daniel shut the shop door and didn&#8217;t answer. &#8220;Ah, you must be hiding from the girls. Is it Hide-and-Seek or Sardines today?&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_24/test_dishes.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="150" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Neither. But can I help you with something?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not really.&#8221; Chad rubbed the board with his hand. &#8220;I have about eight more planks to do, and then I&#8217;ll be finished. Don&#8217;t you have work to do inside?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel swirled his finger through the sawdust and Chad smiled. &#8220;So, you&#8217;re hiding from work then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I just don&#8217;t want to clean the house,&#8221; Daniel said quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too hard for you, huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Daniel scowled. &#8220;It&#8217;s just&#8212;just boring and takes so long. I hate to clean! Besides it&#8217;s girl&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did Mom tell you to do it?&#8221; Chad asked.</p>

<p>Daniel frowned. &#8220;She said I should help out Irene.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chad picked out a new board and stood looking at it. &#8220;In boot camp soldiers are given lots of boring and hard things to test their obedience. Do you know what I&#8217;d do if I were you? Ask God to help me brace up and do a good job. Jesus is our General and He is training us to be obedient servants. It is by conquering the hard things that you get to be strong, you know.&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_24/test_steps.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="275" /></div>
<p>With a clap on the shoulder from Chad, Daniel trudged slowly back to the house. &#8220;Chad would do it,&#8221; Daniel told himself. &#8220;But can I? Do I have to clean up? I don&#8217;t feel like work.&#8221; Shirk work, shirk work, his shoes thudded up the steps.</p>

<p>Daniel stopped. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be a shirker!&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;Dear Lord, help me go work even if I don&#8217;t feel like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you, Daniel?&#8221; Irene called from the kitchen. &#8220;Can you do the dishes so I can get the apples peeled?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221; Daniel walked slowly to the sink and looked at the tall stack of plates, cups, bowls and pans. He sighed. It looked worse than he had imagined.</p>

<p>&#8220;I rinsed them for you. They shouldn&#8217;t be <i>that</i> hard,&#8221; Irene said. She pulled out a bowl and began peeling apples, humming as she went. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be obedient, watch and see; I&#8217;ll be obedient, watch and see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel knew the words, but he didn&#8217;t feel like singing them. He would much rather be commanded to clear out a thicket of blackberries than wash dishes. If only he had been given the lawn to mow or wood to split! &#8220;I&#8217;ll be obedient, watch and see: Jesus&#8217;ll give me the victory!&#8221; Irene&#8217;s voice murmured on. Daniel picked up a plate and scrubbed in silence.</p>

<p>He was only halfway through when Irene dried her hands and opened a cookbook. &#8220;Should I make some applesauce or apple pie?&#8221; she said, flipping through the pages.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something for dessert,&#8221; Daniel said quickly.</p>

<p>Irene laughed. &#8220;How about apple dumplings?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yum!&#8221; said Chad, coming in just then. &#8220;That sounds good! How can I help?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Daniel might need help with the dishes. He&#8217;s going in slow motion or something,&#8221; said Irene.</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of conqueror are you?&#8221; Chad asked, peering over his shoulder. Daniel felt his ears turn pink. What had Chad said about boring work being a test? It seemed like the General had come in to check on him, and he was caught off guard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m almost done, if you want to rinse,&#8221; he said, quickly scrubbing a pot. <i>And I <b>will</b> do my best,</i> he said to himself. <i>I must do my best and not fail the test. My best, my best, scrub, scrub!</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Mom wants the hall closet cleaned out,&#8221; said Irene, as Daniel handed the last dish to Chad. &#8220;It&#8217;s a big mess, but you boys could fix that.&#8221; She grinned at Daniel.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_24/test_closet.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="400" /></div>
<p>Daniel&#8217;s heart sank. <i>You give us all the worst jobs,</i> he thought as he pulled out the plug in the sink. The closet was a mess! A lot more work than the dishes. The door wouldn&#8217;t even shut. He opened his mouth to say so, when he remembered. This was his test! He heard his voice saying, &#8220;Sure, Chad and I can do it. We can conquer hard things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we can,&#8221; said Chad. He pulled open the closet door. &#8220;We&#8217;re tough enough for&#8212;&#8221; Just then a sleeping bag tumbled on his head and two puzzles slid to the floor. Chad&#8217;s old coat and a box of light bulbs nearly toppled after them.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8212;for anything,&#8221; he finished, picking up the puzzles. &#8220;First things first. We&#8217;d better clear it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel couldn&#8217;t help grinning. &#8220;Before it clears us out!&#8221; he said with a laugh. As he pulled down the old coat, a green box caught his eye. &#8220;Hey, Chad, there&#8217;s the Wilderness Survival game! Maybe we can play it tonight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great idea! But,&#8221; Chad added with a wink, &#8220;we need to survive this job first.&#8221;</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_24/Do_You_Obey/index.html">Do You Obey?</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Do You Obey?</h1>

<p>Do you obey your parents? Of course, you will probably say &#8220;yes.&#8221; You know that you are suppose to do what they tell you, and maybe you have a good habit of obeying. But did you ever think that you would have to <i>learn</i> obedience by <i>suffering</i>? That&#8217;s what the Bible tells us Jesus had to do. And He was the most obedient child ever!</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered,&#8221;</span>
it says in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+5%3A8">Hebrews 5:8</a>.
Jesus was the Son of God, sent to earth on a special mission. But do you think it was easy for Him? When people didn&#8217;t treat him nicely and he was tired, do you think He felt like smiling and being kind? But God had sent Him to show love to them all, even when He didn&#8217;t feel like it. So He <i>suffered</i> and did what His Father asked. He learned to obey.</p>

<p>Really, when you <i>want</i> to do something you aren&#8217;t obeying&#8212;you are just doing what you wanted to do. You learn to obey when you have to do something you <i>don&#8217;t</i> want to do. Is it obeying to bring your favorite drink to the table, or to clean out the dirty trash can? When you don&#8217;t <i>want</i> to do it, then you must <i>obey</i>.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+5%3A9" title="Hebrews 5:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 5:9)</span></a></span>
Jesus showed us the way to obey. If we follow and obey Him, then we have the promise of His help. Jesus suffered and won. So can you.</p>

<h1>All Things New</h1>

<p>You like new things, don&#8217;t you? So do I. And I think God must like them most, because He has made so many new things for us to enjoy. Let&#8217;s go on a little nature walk to enjoy them.</p>

<p>We step outside and feel the warm sunshine on our faces. Ahhh! It is a spring morning and the fresh air is filled with good smells. What do you see? The damp earth is bursting out with new flowering bulbs. First come the yellow daffodils and crocus cups of white and purple. Now the tulip buds are starting to turn color. How fresh and alive they look after the dirty bare feeling of winter!</p>

<p>Baby animals are another favorite, so new and unspoiled. How exciting it is to hold a tiny bunny with its soft baby fur! See it frisk and play? It seems filled with new energy and life. Peeping chicks and wobbly lambs, wide-mouthed baby robins and the first butterfly&#8212;spring is so full of new things.</p>

<p>Can you think of a time you got something new? Like the wheelbarrow with two strong tires instead of the old cracked wheel. How fun it is to try it out! It is so much better than the old one that you want to use it all the time! God loves to make all things new for us. He has new love when yours gets worn out watching the fussy baby. He has a new smile to send fresh for the work you have to do. He has a new heart of peace to give anyone who will give up their selfish fearful one. And how much better God&#8217;s new things are than our old ones! Ask Him for what you need today.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grandpa, would you have been a soldier and gone off to fight?&#8221; Alice asked as she closed the newspaper. Edward and Sammy stopped wrestling and looked at Grandpa.</p>

<p>&#8220;No and yes,&#8221; he said with a smile. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t go shoot someone, because Jesus has given me love for everybody. But I do have enemies to fight, just like David did a long time ago&#8230;.</p>

<h1>A Man of War</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Samuel+16-">I&nbsp;Samuel 16</a> through <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Samuel">II&nbsp;Samuel</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">You remember the story of the shepherd boy who fought the giant, don&#8217;t you? Well, that wasn&#8217;t the only battle young David had to fight. Back in the hills he often had to protect the sheep from bears and lions. He had learned to be brave and trust in God to help him win. As a soldier in King Saul&#8217;s army, the brave young man soon became a hero.</p>

<p>But being a hero isn&#8217;t easy. Saul was jealous of David, so he tried to kill him. From then on David had to hide in caves and bear many hardships. Still he counted on God, and fought for God&#8217;s people. And God helped him win other battles&#8212;battles to forgive Saul and do right when others did wrong.</p>

<p>When David at last came to be king over Israel and Judah, he had a very big job. Now he had to protect the whole kingdom! There were many enemies who wanted to rule instead of David. If he was going to be a good king and keep the people safe, he had to fight. And fight he did.</p>

<p>First he battled the Philistines on one side, who had been big bullies for a long time. Next he subdued the Moabites and made them his servants. After that he captured the prince of Zobah with thousands of chariots, horsemen, and soldiers. And through it all God protected him.</p>

<p>As a man of war David didn&#8217;t get proud. He always remembered that God was the one who helped him. When other kings gave him gifts of silver and gold, David gave them to God. He praised God and thanked him for the victories he won. Soon David became know as a very good king. He ruled wisely and justly, and God blessed him.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t really understand,&#8221; said Alice when Grandpa had finished. &#8220;David killed real people, but you said you wouldn&#8217;t want to kill anyone.&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; Grandpa agreed. &#8220;But in King David&#8217;s time people couldn&#8217;t have their hearts changed and so they had to fight outside enemies. But now Jesus calls us to conquer over our inside enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind are those?&#8221; asked Edward.</p>

<p>Grandpa looked at his grandsons. &#8220;If you two were complaining about chores, what sort of enemy would you need to fight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad attitudes?&#8221; asked Sammy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Complaining thoughts?&#8221; asked Edward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and Giant Selfish, too. God wants you to be a brave soldier like David, but your kingdom is your heart. Who will you let rule it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Myself and no one else!&#8221; cried Edward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that being kind of selfish?&#8221; asked Alice with a frown.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, I mean, I would beat all the bad things and giants that come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t they be too big for you?&#8221; asked Grandpa.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ask God to help me,&#8221; said Edward. &#8220;Just like King David did.&#8221;</p>

<h1>The Call of Love: Part 1</h1>

<p>Justin had a hard lot. The bigger children said he was a baby, and maybe he was. But Justin didn&#8217;t like it when others made fun of him. It wasn&#8217;t funny that he bumped his knee when he tried to catch the rooster. &#8220;I can&#8217;t help it if I cry,&#8221; Justin said, rubbing his eyes. &#8220;It hurts!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You cry as if you <i>broke</i> your leg,&#8221; said Sam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you better stay inside so you won&#8217;t get hurt,&#8221; said Rochelle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll just play with Teddy,&#8221; Justin muttered, and went to find his little cousin. Teddy didn&#8217;t tease, and soon was following him on a bear hunt behind the tool shed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Justin!&#8221; It was Aunt Linda. And she wasn&#8217;t happy. Suddenly Justin remembered that he had been sent to gather eggs. Now Aunt Linda would call him &#8220;undependable.&#8221; He hated to go to the house, but he did. Slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Justin. What happened?&#8221; Justin could tell when his aunt didn&#8217;t like what he did. She pushed her lips together in a frowning sort of way and he felt like hiding. It made him feel all jittery inside. Like something bad was going to happen.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_24/call_eggs.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="350" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Where are the eggs?&#8221; Justin looked at his toes. &#8220;Go get them, and then I want to talk to you.&#8221; He felt the hand on his shoulder push him sort of hard. Why couldn&#8217;t she just give him a hug? His mom would give him a hug. But Justin didn&#8217;t have a mom.</p>

<p>The chicken house was dark and as Justin reached the last nest he tripped over something. <i>Clank-bang!</i> The egg basket flew out of his hands and crashed to the floor. The eggs were smashed and gooey and now he would have to clean them up! Justin leaned against the wall and cried.</p>

<p>Everything was going wrong again. And what would Dad say when he got home? He yelled when Justin had been bad. &#8220;Justin Carey! I&#8217;m tired of hearing how you cause everyone trouble. You&#8217;re nearly eleven&#8212;old enough to behave. Shape up, or you&#8217;ll get it!&#8221; It was bad when he &#8220;got it.&#8221; The memory made Justin cry louder. Suddenly he stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Justin?&#8221; It was Aunt Linda standing in the doorway. Justin hurriedly kicked some straw over the broken eggs and picked up the basket. Aunt Linda turned to the house without saying anything. When they got to the porch she would talk to him again. She always talked to him when he was bad.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have to make a choice,&#8221; she said, looking at him sternly. &#8220;You are not helping anything by crying, but only making yourself miserable. I want to be able to count on you, but I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sad,&#8221; Justin sniffed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like it when you&#8217;re mad at me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not mad at you, Justin, but your selfishness is making you miserable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t do anything right!&#8221; Justin wailed, covering his face with his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jesus will help you do right if you&#8217;ll ask Him,&#8221; Aunt Linda reminded him. &#8220;Shall we pray?&#8221; She always said that, just like it was her favorite thing to do.</p>

<p>Justin shrugged. &#8220;You pray.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her arm felt heavy on his shoulder as she said, &#8220;Dear Lord, You see Justin&#8217;s problem and how he needs help. I know You love him very much. Please help him want to do right and have a cheerful attitude. In Jesus&#8217; name I pray, Amen.&#8221; Everything was still and it felt safe under Aunt Linda&#8217;s arm. Justin knew he should say something.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear God, help me be good. Amen,&#8221; he whispered. He felt a bit better. If only Aunt Linda didn&#8217;t mention the cracked eggs, maybe it would be alright.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I go play now?&#8221; Aunt Linda hesitated. Justin knew she would give him a job if she could think of one. &#8220;I could watch Teddy for you,&#8221; he pleaded, adding his best smile. She always liked it when he smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to do the dishes after supper then,&#8221; she said, standing up. It wasn&#8217;t worth arguing about that one.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_24/call_swing.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="425" /></div>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; he promised.</p>

<p>Freedom! Justin felt like yelling as he dashed through the gate into the backyard. Teddy was swinging on the tire. &#8220;Push me!&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve had a long turn already.&#8221; Justin gave a big shove to the tire. &#8220;Three swings and then it&#8217;s my turn.&#8221; Teddy grinned as he soared high above the fence, but Justin just counted. Teddy would give in to him. It was the older cousins that always argued.</p>

<p>He was just giving himself a big kick off when Sam came around the corner of the house pushing the go-cart. Why hadn&#8217;t he thought of that sooner? &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s make the high-jump today!&#8221; Justin said, springing down to clear the way to their favorite dirt track.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we were going to hitch Daisy up and go down the lane,&#8221; said Rochelle, bringing a rope from the shed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daisy is too slow,&#8221; Justin said, frowning.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Mom said we can&#8217;t make a high-jump,&#8221; Sam said. He took the end of the rope and tied it to the front axle.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can still make a track over the dump,&#8221; Justin argued, crossing his arms. But no one would listen. He watched in growing anger as they tied the little gray donkey to the cart. Rochelle climbed in and Sam pulled on the lead, but Daisy wouldn&#8217;t budge.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it wouldn&#8217;t work,&#8221; Justin growled to himself. &#8220;They never listen to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to ride on Daisy!&#8221; Teddy said, jumping up and down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, then.&#8221; Sam boosted him up and Daisy stepped forward quickly. The cart gave a lurch and rolled forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get up!&#8221; Teddy cried, kicking his heels. Daisy took two more steps, but then stopped. But the cart kept on rolling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch out!&#8221; yelled Justin. It was too late. As the go-cart banged into Daisy&#8217;s heels she jumped forward and then kicked, snapping the wheels right off.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve ruined it!&#8221; Justin screamed, and threw himself down to pound the dirt. Teddy was crying and Rochelle was calling for help. Justin didn&#8217;t listen. The go-cart that he had worked so hard to build was smashed! Tears blinded his eyes and he shook with angry sobs. He was mad at the silly donkey and his cousins. He was mad that no one listened, that no one even cared. &#8220;Stupid, stupid idiots!&#8221; he choked. &#8220;You never care about anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>How long he lay there, Justin didn&#8217;t know. It was the stillness that made him look up, and he found that the yard was empty. Off to one side the go-cart had been left, nose in the dirt. He couldn&#8217;t see the front wheels anywhere.</p>

<p>As he pulled himself up, Justin felt the blood throb in his head. He felt sick and miserable. And very alone.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_24/call_cart.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></div>
<p>Justin stumbled toward the house. He was dirty, but probably no one would notice. No one loved him anyway. Maybe he should go to the barn. At least Trinket might want to curl up with him. &#8220;Here, kitty!&#8221; he called softly as he passed the shed. No kitty came.</p>

<p>The door opened and Rochelle called to him. Justin pretended not to hear. He slumped down beside the shed. He was still mad at her for ruining the go-cart. &#8220;It&#8217;s suppertime!&#8221; Rochelle called. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you hungry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Justin was hungry. Just now he felt his stomach churning, but he wouldn&#8217;t go in. The screen door slammed and he could hear their voices. If Aunt Linda came, just <i>maybe</i> he would go in. Justin waited. And waited. But no one came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Trinket,&#8221; Justin whispered as he felt soft fur rub up against him. It was getting dark and he was glad for company. &#8220;What do you have in your mouth?&#8221; She had caught something alright. Justin looked in disgust at the pile of feathers that Trinket dropped at his feet. &#8220;Get it away from me. I don&#8217;t want any of your old bird.&#8221;</p>

<p>No one seemed to notice when he slipped inside. Dishes were clinking and supper was probably over. At least someone else would wash the dishes. Justin cleaned up in the bathroom and went to his room. It was Sam and Teddy&#8217;s room, really.</p>

<p>He slumped on Teddy&#8217;s bed and picked up his favorite monster truck book, but he didn&#8217;t feel like reading. No one wanted him here, so why did he have to come? Justin knew Dad had to work long hours trucking, but it didn&#8217;t seem fair.</p>

<p>Above the bed there was a picture of Jesus holding the children on his lap. Who was that Man that Aunt Linda said could help him? He seemed so far away. All of a sudden he wished he were home in his own bed with a mommy to love him. He buried his face in the pillow and for the fourth time that afternoon Justin cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is time for prayer,&#8221; Aunt Linda said, touching him on the shoulder. Justin felt tired and his head ached. He lay still, hoping she would think he was asleep. &#8220;Justin, I know you are disappointed about the go-cart, but it doesn&#8217;t help to be angry about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The memory of that terrible afternoon flooded back and Justin clenched his fists. Aunt Linda continued on: &#8220;Jesus wants us to forgive. He wants to take the hate and sadness out and to fill your heart with love and peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why did she have to talk like that? Just like it was <i>his</i> fault that everything went wrong! She didn&#8217;t care that his head hurt and that he didn&#8217;t have supper. She just thought that he was a bad boy. Well, he wasn&#8217;t! Justin made up his mind that he wasn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jesus loves you, dear, and He is calling to you&#8230;&#8203;Justin, Justin.&#8221; Aunt Linda&#8217;s voice pleaded as she whispered the words, but he wasn&#8217;t going to yield to them. Not yet. Maybe not ever.</p>

<h2>Something You Can Do</h2>
<p>Do you like to paint pictures? Springtime is full of new and beautiful things, so make a picture or card for someone special to you! Here is a fun project to try, using watercolor paint and a good imagination:</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_24/picture_paper.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="275" /></div>
<h1>Picture Springtime</h1>

<p>You will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>watercolor paper or other thick paper</li>

<li>watercolor paints and paint brush</li>

<li>felt tip pens or a black ink pen</li>

</ul>
<ol>
<li>Dampen your paper with a wet brush so that the picture will have a soft look when you start painting.</li>

<li>To begin, choose 3-5 cheerful colors. Try yellow, purple and green. Or pink, blue, green, and brown. Mix enough water into each of them so they will give a light color.</li>

<li>Now, daub the colors on your paper in any way you want. Use strokes or splashes, being careful not to mix them. Your paper should be colorful like spring, with white areas in between. For my picture I sprinkled water drops on the paint as it was drying.</li>

<li>Let your painting dry all the way. While you wait, start looking for the pictures of spring hidden it it. Maybe you will see daffodils and crocus flowers. Or maybe a butterfly on a little lamb&#8217;s nose! Can you imagine more new things that show springtime?</li>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_24/picture_two.jpg" alt="" width="234" height="125" /></div>
<li>Now use your pens to make your imaginations come to life. Be careful to use only a few lines and let the color show through. There is more than one way to draw in your picture. See how my springtime picture could turn out two ways?</li>

<li>When you are done, you can use the whole picture, or cut out your favorite part to glue on a card. How about making your card for Mother or Father&#8217;s Day? You can add a verse or special message to bring new joy to their day!</li>

</ol>

<h1>When Cricket Complained</h1>

<p>Cricket was a lively little boy. His name was Jeremy, but he always liked to chirp like crickets do when they are happy. So Mother and Daddy called him Cricket.</p>

<p>This morning Cricket decided that he did not like green beans anymore. Now, he&#8217;d always liked green beans before. He helped plant them, pick them, and snap them. You would think that Cricket would like those green beans after all of that. And he did&#8212;until this morning.</p>

<p>He wasn&#8217;t sick. At least, he didn&#8217;t have a fever or a cold, but there was <i>something</i> bothering him. It bothers lots of children. Cricket didn&#8217;t know what it was. He just knew that things weren&#8217;t going just as he liked. So he stared at his plate gloomily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like green beans!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Mother looked at him. Daddy looked at him. Big Sister and Big Brother looked at him. And his little brother, Sam, sat in his high chair and stared at him.</p>

<p>Mother said, &#8220;Cricket, you&#8217;ve always liked green beans!&#8221;</p>

<p>Daddy reached over and speared a green bean with his fork. He ate it. &#8220;Boy, this is delicious,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Cricket scowled, and kept staring at the green beans. They looked like slimy, green slugs. He knew his green beans were horrible, no matter <i>how</i> many Daddy ate. Besides, he wanted to go play in the sandbox <i>now</i>, and he knew they wouldn&#8217;t let him during breakfast. <i>They</i> would try to make him help with the dishes and make his bed.</p>

<p>Just then Sam, who was learning to drink out of a cup, accidentally sloshed water out of his cup and it splashed just a <i>little</i> bit on Jeremy&#8217;s shirt.</p>

<p>Cricket let out a howl that sounded like a whole war party of Apache Indians! He dumped his <i>full</i> glass of water on Sam&#8217;s head. Then Sam yelled and kicked Cricket. Then came spankings and a Bible story about how the Israelites complained about the manna that God gave them to eat.</p>

<p>I wish I could say that Cricket learned not to complain and rebel after this, but he didn&#8217;t. Instead, he began whining about <i>everything</i>. He didn&#8217;t think his parents were fair to him, and <i>nobody</i> treated him just right. He stopped making cheerful, chirping noises, and no one called him Cricket anymore. His family did nice things for him, but Jeremy was so unthankful that they soon tried to stay out of his way. And he found fault with that, too. &#8220;Everybody is out to get me,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;Nobody likes me.&#8221; Actually, some people <i>tried</i> to be friends with him, but it was too hard.</p>

<p>When he grew up, he didn&#8217;t stop complaining. He thought his wife didn&#8217;t appreciate him, and his children complained about their green beans and didn&#8217;t realize how hard he worked for them. His boss was unfair, and he had mean neighbors. &#8220;I have the worst luck. Everyone&#8217;s against me,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Jeremy, the grownup, thought about dying and what came after that. He figured that God wouldn&#8217;t be fair to him, either, and wouldn&#8217;t let him go to heaven&#8212;<i>if</i> there was a heaven, he thought.</p>

<p>Poor Jeremy! There, in the other place that is <i>not</i> heaven, he would meet the one who had bothered him all his life: Jeremy&#8217;s real enemy, who had made him feel discontented and unthankful. &#8220;I&#8217;ve waited for you a long time, Jeremy!&#8221; the devil would roar. &#8220;Come and join the other complainers!&#8221;</p>

<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Princess,</p>

<p>Precious skipped happily up the walk singing, &#8220;&#8230;&#8203;By faith and not by sight.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/By_Faith_and_Not_By_Sight/index.html" title="By Faith and Not By Sight">*</a> It was the new song King Jesus had just taught her on their daily walk through His gardens. The sun was shining so brightly and Precious felt like she could almost fly.</p>

<p>Mother Matron met her with a smile. &#8220;I am going to be out this morning. You need to do the breakfast dishes and then Joy will help you mop the floor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mother Matron.&#8221; Precious hummed to herself as she filled the sink with water. Even the dishes didn&#8217;t seem like a chore on a sunny day like this. As she was rinsing a plate, a thought popped into her head. <i>Maybe if I finish the dishes quickly I can ask Mother Matron if I can go with her. This afternoon I will have plenty of time to do the floor.</i></p>

<p>A few minutes later she gave a last swipe to the counter and hurried to find Mother Matron. &#8220;I have the dishes done, may I please go with you?&#8221; Precious asked. &#8220;I will do the floor this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As long as you make sure it gets done,&#8221; agreed the Matron, reluctantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will, and thank you!&#8221; Precious said happily.</p>

<p>After buying groceries and stopping at GoodWill, they started home. Precious couldn&#8217;t wait to show Joy her new shoes. But as they turned into their driveway she could hardly believe her eyes. Aunt Julia and Uncle Wayne&#8217;s car was parked near the house and cousin Beth was playing on the lawn with Joy!</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_24/letter_doll.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></div>
<p>After lunch Precious took Beth&#8217;s hand. &#8220;Have you seen our new playhouse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I haven&#8217;t,&#8221; Beth replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then come. It is <i>so</i> much fun&#8212;almost like being in a real house.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hours sped by quickly. The little table was all set for supper when the girls heard a call. &#8220;Precious, where are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am coming, Mother Matron,&#8221; Precious called back. &#8220;You put Emily and Kristin to bed while I am gone,&#8221; she said to Beth, and skipped happily to the house.</p>

<p>Mother Matron met her at the door. &#8220;The kitchen floor still needs to be mopped. I am sorry but Joy is down for a nap and so you will have to do it by yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The light went out from Precious&#8217; face in a moment. &#8220;Oh, I had forgotten.&#8221; Slowly, Precious went to get the broom and mop. She and Beth had been having the most wonderful time. Why did the day have to end like this? She glanced out the window and saw Beth waving good-bye. And as if to make things worse, it had started to rain.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_24/letter_mop.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="225" /></div>
<p><i>This morning all had seemed so bright. Why couldn&#8217;t it be that way all the time?</i> But then she stopped herself. <i>What was the song King Jesus had taught her that very morning? Something about&#8230;&#8203;yes: &#8220;Walking with Jesus my way is bright, By faith and not by sight.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>King Jesus had explained it. He had said that to be truly happy she shouldn&#8217;t focus on if she felt like it or not, but to keep doing what was right. He let things happen to her, and even if they seemed hard, He could make it turn into good.</p>

<p>As He had pointed to the flowers in the garden, He had said, &#8220;Princess Precious, what would happen if the flowers only got sunshine? They would wilt and die. They need the rain just as you need the hard things in your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Precious smiled at the rain and turned from the window. She picked up the broom and started to sweep. She wouldn&#8217;t complain when the rain fell down. It was what she needed.</p>

<p>Soon a song drifted from the kitchen. &#8220;Walking with Jesus my way is bright, By faith and not by sight.&#8221;</p>
