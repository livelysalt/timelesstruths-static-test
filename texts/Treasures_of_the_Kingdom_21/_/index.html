<h1>Rosie&#8217;s Inheritance</h1>

<p>Rosie and Irene sat in their favorite &#8220;reading nook,&#8221; as the rain pattered against the windows one afternoon in the autumn. It had been a busy house cleaning day, with laundry to wash and fold. At last Mother had said they could be free to go read awhile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be fun to live in a castle, though?&#8221; Rosie said with a sigh, as Irene finished the chapter. They had been reading <i>Caddie Woodlawn</i>, and Rosie had been impatient to know if the Woodlawn family would go to England and become lords and ladies.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I would be happiest here,&#8221; said Irene. &#8220;Why would you want to live in a castle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be fun to explore, and&#8212;and,&#8221; Rosie looked down, &#8220;we wouldn&#8217;t have to do so much work and could buy new things. We wouldn&#8217;t have to fold laundry again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I doubt it would ever happen,&#8221; Irene said with a shrug. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have any rich relatives to inherit from, though Great-grandpa Coleman did live in England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you get anything when Great-grandpa died?&#8221; Rosie asked Dad at the supper table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rosie wants an English castle willed to her,&#8221; Irene teased.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing that grand,&#8221; Dad said, with a smile, &#8220;but we did get the secretary desk and a small inheritance. He wasn&#8217;t very rich, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got his pen,&#8221; Daniel said, &#8220;but I guess that isn&#8217;t worth much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad!&#8221; Chad said with a great sigh. &#8220;I just was waiting to be an English lord.&#8221; He winked at Rosie, and the others laughed.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_21/inheritance_dishes.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="241" /></div>
<p><i>I do wish we were just a little bit richer,</i> Rosie thought gloomily, as she slowly began clearing the table. The sink was leaking again, so they would have to use a basin to wash the dishes tonight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s be cheerful, dear,&#8221; Mama said, as she brought in the dish water.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard,&#8221; Rosie said, a bit crossly. Mom didn&#8217;t seem to hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Lord has blessed us in so many ways, even if we don&#8217;t have much money. We really do have a great inheritance&#8212;think of all the promises He has given us!&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose swished her hands in the soap suds. &#8220;What does <i>inheritance</i> mean?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it is something passed down to you in a will from someone that died, like money or property. But when Jesus died, God gave us an inheritance that is much more valuable. He made us His very own children and gave us a whole book full of riches.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about, <span class="scripture">&#8216;my God shall supply all your need,&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+4%3A19" title="Philippians 4:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 4:19)</span></a></span>&nbsp;&#8221;
said Mother with a smile. &#8220;That is like saying He has given us a pass to all the stores we would ever go to!&#8221; Rosie thought about storerooms filled with good things in heaven. She knew they were there, because Daddy had often told her about them.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do we get it, though?&#8221; she asked, thinking about a new sink.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, do you remember the inheritance that Caddie Woodlawn&#8217;s family got?&#8221; Mom asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Rosie said slowly. &#8220;But they didn&#8217;t want to leave their home in America, so they didn&#8217;t get to have it after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; agreed Mom. &#8220;And just the same way, God had things stored up for us, but we have to let go of our own ways and wishes to get them.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Rosie got ready for bed that night, she thought about what Mom had said. <i>I guess God wants me to be cheerful before I can get anything,</i> she thought, and folded her hands to pray. &#8220;Help me be to obey and be cheerful, dear Lord,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Even if we have lots of chores and a leaky sink. Amen.&#8221; Rosie crawled into bed and fell asleep thinking of castles in heaven.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_21/inheritance_reading.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="188" /></div>
<p>It was early when Rosie woke up, but Irene was already sitting by the window, reading her Bible. Rosie thought of the promise Mother had told her and wondered where it was. &#8220;Irene,&#8221; she said, crawling out of bed, &#8220;where does it say that God will give us what we need?&#8221;</p>

<p>Irene was quiet for a minute, then she said slowly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but the verse I am memorizing says,
<span class="scripture">&#8216;no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+84%3A11" title="Psalm 84:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 84:11)</span></a></span>&nbsp;&#8221;
She pointed to the place in her Bible. &#8220;That is from
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+84">Psalm 84</a>,
and it means that if we do right, God will give us all the good things He has.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosie smiled. &#8220;I guess it is another promise like what Mama was talking about. She said it&#8217;s like our &#8217;heritance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that is true,&#8221; Irene said slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the Bible is sort of like the letter that the Woodlawns got,&#8221; said Rosie, excitedly. &#8220;It tells us about all the castles and wonderful things God has given to us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we <span class="scripture">&#8216;walk uprightly,&#8217;</span>&nbsp;&#8221; added Irene, pointing to the verse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I asked Jesus to help me to work cheerfully,&#8221; Rosie said, looking around at the jumbled bed covers and the new pile of laundry.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, <span class="scripture">&#8216;I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me,&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+4%3A13" title="Philippians 4:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 4:13)</span></a></span>&nbsp;&#8221; Irene recited. &#8220;We should write our inheritance promises down to remember them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosie jumped up. &#8220;We can put them in a little box and call it our Inheritance Box!&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;After our chores!&#8221; Irene said with a laugh.</p>

<h1>The Best Gifts</h1>

<p>You like to receive gifts and get things, don&#8217;t you? When it is someone special to you, you expect a special gift. Maybe your great uncle would send you a birthday card, but a card from Dad or Mom wouldn&#8217;t be so special. They give you bigger things: something you&#8217;ve wanted, your favorite food, or a special trip somewhere. They don&#8217;t do that for the neighbor children. You get their time and attention because you belong to them. When you love someone, the more you give them, don&#8217;t you?</p>

<p>God has given each of us our life. Think about all God gives. Because of His goodness you have food to eat and clothes to wear, a place to sleep, and people that care about you. But God saves His most special gifts for His own children. They are special to Him, and He loves to give them the very best. Do you want God&#8217;s very best gifts? He asks for you to give yourself to Him and belong to Him.</p>

<p>Think about Rosie in the story. If she didn&#8217;t love God, she wouldn&#8217;t care to do right and please Him. But since she did love Him, she thought about what He wanted&#8212;for her to be cheerful. And since she belonged to the Lord, she could ask Him for it. And didn&#8217;t He give it to her? Yes, He did! When we give Him our ways and let go of what we want, He has so much better to give us.</p>

<p>God wants to give many, many good gifts to His children. The Bible is a treasure chest of the good things He has for those that love Him. The best gifts are the kind you can&#8217;t see on the outside. He has storerooms of love and the bright robe of right-living for us to wear inside. There are cheerfulness and kindness gifts, which He especially loves to give when things go wrong. In fact, the Lord has special gifts for each problem and new ones for every day. Give God all you have (which is a little bit), and He will give you all He has (which is a lot)!</p>

<h1>Science in the Graveyard</h1>

<p>Up on a grassy hillside near our garden we have a graveyard. This summer my little scientist friend and I marched up there twice. Our guinea pig had gotten sick and died, first. With a shovel we tried to chop away at the hard dry ground, and soon went to get the hose. When the hole was deep enough we laid the little animal to rest. A few days later one of our rabbits died suddenly. Out came the shovel and we worked a long time to make her a grave. As we covered her up with dirt, we thought of how she was really gone now. Gone, and soon to be forgotten.</p>

<p>Why did we bury the dead animals? It was a lot of work and time, but it was important. Dead bodies attract wild animals and flies, as well as making a horrible smell. Who would want a rotting animal lying around? I wouldn&#8217;t! I want to be around live things, don&#8217;t you? When something is dead, it is time to bury it away in a grave. Though they once were our pets, now we have to cover them up and forget them.</p>

<p>Can you figure out the science lesson of the graveyard? There are other things besides dead animals that we need to bury. There are bad attitudes and hard feelings to bury. God can help you get rid of selfishness and anger. He can kill the problem and help you to bury it, too. I&#8217;ve heard someone say, &#8220;I forgive you&#8230;&#8203;but it was really mean what you did.&#8221; Is that really forgiving them? If something is dead, it is not a good idea to carry it around with you. Soon you&#8217;ll start to stink! So if you carry around little &#8220;poor me&#8221; and &#8220;they are mean&#8221; thoughts, you will start having a bad attitude again. When we ask God to help us with our heart problems, we need to dig a deep hole and cover them well with forgetfulness. You don&#8217;t want to smell a rotting attitude again, do you?</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Ed, please don&#8217;t!&#8221; Alice cried, jerking her hair from her brother&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>Grandpa frowned. &#8220;Edward, you know better than to bother your sister.&#8221; As Edward hung his head, Grandpa added, &#8220;Let&#8217;s stop thinking of ourselves. Shall I tell you a story?&#8221;</p>

<p>The children clambered up on his chair and Grandpa began:</p>

<h1>Love That Served</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+12%2C+16%2C+18%2C+19">John 12, 16, 18, 19</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Jesus had come to Jerusalem for the last time. As He stood looking down at the busy city, He felt sad. How many times He had helped and taught and prayed for them! But they didn&#8217;t care: they only wanted Him to be a great king and get rid of all their troubles. How tired He was of all their selfishness and sin! But as Jesus looked at the children waving palms and everyone singing, He smiled. He had come to show God&#8217;s love to them, and He wouldn&#8217;t stop now. He would treat them better than they deserved. His Father would help Him conquer with love.</p>

<p>It was Judas, one of the disciples that had followed Jesus everywhere, that brought the officers to get Him. It was dark when they came into the quiet garden, but Jesus was ready. No, not with an army of angels and swords. No, He had prayed and was ready now to suffer. &#8220;Be not afraid, I have overcome the world,&#8221; Jesus told the disciples. He was ready to die for them.</p>

<p>They chained Him that night and hauled Him down the road like a thief. Jesus didn&#8217;t kick or fight. He stood quietly while the chief priests blamed Him and called Him bad names. He didn&#8217;t snap back or complain. He wasn&#8217;t going to get even. But He prayed. It was hard enough to love people who didn&#8217;t care, and now they beat Him and laughed at His groans. But Jesus thought instead of their sad and guilty hearts. He was going to fight the sin and evil with love.</p>

<p>&#8220;Crucify him!&#8221; the crowd who had sang for Him now screamed, as Jesus stumbled up the road to Golgatha. They were going to nail Him to a cross there. Didn&#8217;t He want to sink down and pray for angels to come? He could have said, &#8220;I have done my best. I am sorry, but I can&#8217;t take it anymore. This is too hard!&#8221; But Jesus set His heart to do what was right, and didn&#8217;t try to escape. The thorns hurt, His back throbbed with pain, but He didn&#8217;t blame that cruel crowd. He was suffering <i>for them</i>, and because He was obedient until death He could say, &#8220;It is finished.&#8221; God&#8217;s plan of salvation was accomplished.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>&#8220;Why did you tell that story?&#8221; asked Alice.</p>

<p>Grandpa smiled. &#8220;I was thinking about Jesus&#8217; sufferings and how we are called to follow in His steps. How can we be like Jesus?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By thinking about others first,&#8221; suggested Edward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, don&#8217;t you think it would be better to keep busy trying to serve others, rather than getting into trouble for being a pest?&#8221; Grandpa said to Edward, his eyes twinkling. &#8220;God is pleased when we do hard things patiently. He will help us be kind when others are cross.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice blushed. &#8220;I think it was for me, too,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am sorry for snapping back at you, Edward. I think Jesus would have spoken in a kinder way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I forgive you,&#8221; said Edward. &#8220;And I&#8217;m sorry for pulling your hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that wasn&#8217;t much compared to being beaten,&#8221; Alice said with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must&#8217;ve been really hard,&#8221; agreed Edward, thoughtfully. &#8220;But Jesus kept loving them and forgiving them. He had to pray for God&#8217;s help, didn&#8217;t He?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess so,&#8221; said Alice. &#8220;And God can help me love others more, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica Andrews was a decided enemy of tobacco. She used to say she hated it. Now <i>hate</i> is a strong word, I know. My mother has often said to me, &#8220;My dear, you must hate nothing but sin&#8221;; and I never use the word without thinking of her advice. But I think, as Jessica did, that it is quite proper to say &#8220;hate&#8221; in speaking of tobacco, for it is a poison, and it injures more people than most folks are willing to believe. And then, it is so nasty! There, that is another word my mother never liked to hear me use. She said it isn&#8217;t a &#8220;pretty word.&#8221; I think it fits tobacco; and Jessica always thought so, too.</p>

<p>Jessica was a queer child. She never acted like other children, but had a way all her own, which sometimes made folks laugh, and sometimes cry, and always made them shake their heads, and say: &#8220;What an odd little girl Jessica Andrews is!&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_21/jessica_graveyard.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="284" /></div>
<p>She got the idea one day that she would have a little graveyard all her own. There was a part of the garden behind the house where nothing was planted. A long row of blackberry bushes hid it from sight, and she used to go down there to play. It was one day after she had been to the church cemetery for a neighbor&#8217;s funeral, that she got the idea of having the graveyard. She went straight off to the woods, and brought home four pretty little trees, which she planted in the four corners of the ground she had chosen. Thinking it would be best to get permission to use it, she went next to find her dad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daddy! Daddy!&#8221; she called aloud, as he and several men were working in the machine shop. &#8220;Will you give me the northwest corner of the garden?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The what, child?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The northwest corner of the old garden. It is next to the old apple tree on the north side, with the walkway opposite, the cornfield on the west, and the blackberry bushes hide it from the house.&#8221; The men laughed at the conclusion of this speech, and Mother came out to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to make fun of me,&#8221; exclaimed Jessica. &#8220;I tried to explain it carefully so you wouldn&#8217;t have to go see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jessica wants me to deed her the northwest corn of the garden, Mother,&#8221; said Mr. Andrews. &#8220;Are you ready to sign the papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want it for, my dear?&#8221; asked Mother. &#8220;Are you going to build a playhouse?&#8221; Her mother knew that it was Jessica&#8217;s favorite place to be. She was quite unprepared for the answer, and for the roar of laughter, which was repeated as the child looked up and replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I want it for a graveyard, Mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Dad had recovered the power of speech, he asked, &#8220;What are you going to bury, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>Quick as a flash of light, Jessica picked up her dad&#8217;s cigarette pack, which lay by the door. &#8220;This first,&#8221; said she, and off she ran.</p>

<p>So quick was her motion and the words that accompanied it, that no one saw what she had done. But when evening came, and Dad was ready for his evening smoke, the pack was missed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s my cigarettes? Who has seen that new package of cigarettes I bought?&#8221; shouted Dad in a loud, angry voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I buried them, Daddy, in my new graveyard,&#8221; said the child coolly. &#8220;Come and see.&#8221;</p>

<p>The heavy steps of the tired man and the light trip-trip of the little girl&#8217;s feet fell together on the garden walk as they set out for the northwest corner of the garden, where Jessica pointed to a neat little mound. At the head of it was placed a bit of shingle with the inscription:</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_21/jessica_grave.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="148" /></div>
<p>&#8220;HERE LIES MY DAD&#8217;S CIGARETTES. REST FOREVER.&#8221;</p>

<p>The astonished man was at a loss for words. He didn&#8217;t know whether to laugh or be angry. Finally he concluded to do neither, but to try to get at the child&#8217;s meaning in all this. So, sitting down on an old cinder block, he took Jessica on his knees and began to question her. &#8220;Why did you bury them, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because, Daddy, I didn&#8217;t want you to die, as Mr. Thurston did. It&#8217;s a fact, Daddy,&#8221; she said hurriedly, seeing him start to smile. &#8220;I heard Dr. Bell say so when we were coming from the funeral. Miss Stevens asked him what was wrong with Mr. Thurston, and Dr. Bell said: &#8216;Those cigarettes, Miss Stevens. Chain smoker he was. He smoked himself out of this world and into&#8212;well, I can&#8217;t say exactly where he has gone. If folks get addicted to their cigarettes here, I don&#8217;t see what they&#8217;re going to do in the other. It seems to me they&#8217;ll want to keep up the smoking. I&#8217;m almost sure they can&#8217;t do it in heaven, for you know, Miss Stevens, heaven is a clean place and there is not going to be anything there that defiles.&#8217; So, Daddy, I thought I&#8217;d dig a grave and bury that pack of cigarettes you bought. You won&#8217;t dig them up, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man was silent for a few minutes. Then he said slowly, but firmly: &#8220;No, Jessica, your father is no grave robber. I shall miss my smoke; but I suppose I must say about it as we do about everything that&#8217;s put in the grave, &#8216;Thy will be done.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; said the child, with a kiss.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was that what you wanted this great graveyard for?&#8221; asked Dad, smiling again, and hoping to turn her thoughts to something else. &#8220;Was it only to bury those cigarettes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jessica earnestly. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to bury other things here, too. I expect I shall have a funeral almost every day. I&#8217;m going to bury Uncle Jim&#8217;s beer mug next.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dad looked surprised. &#8220;How will you get it?&#8221; Dad asked in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll get it! I&#8217;ll manage, Daddy. And Gary Smith smokes, too, and then there&#8217;s Ally&#8217;s fashion magazines and Margy&#8217;s novels. I do want to bury those soon!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica proved to be a busy little undertaker, and before the week had passed more than a dozen items had been buried in the new cemetery. The graves were all made evenly, side by side, exactly the same size, nicely rounded and marked. At the head of each was a tiny board on which she had written some inscription. These headboards had cost the girl much time and effort. On one was: &#8220;Jim Andrews&#8217;s Beer Mug. Drained out.&#8221; On another: &#8220;Cousin Alyssa&#8217;s Fashion Magazines. Lost to view.&#8221; On the next: &#8220;Margery Winter&#8217;s Romance novels. Closed forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>The northwest corner of the garden was finally full. More than sixty neat little graves were there in rows. The apple tree spread a friendly shade over the spot, and the blackberries ripened beside them; and many a visitor was taken slyly down the garden walk to see Jessica&#8217;s graveyard. But the best part was that for ever mound in that quiet spot, there stood a man or woman redeemed from an evil habit. Each bore testimony to the faithfulness and perseverance of a girl who loved purity and good health.</p>

<h2>Something You Can Do</h2>
<p>Have you ever visited a cemetary? They are really very interesting places to go. Think about all the lives and stories there are to learn about! Every person in history has died (unless they are still alive), including your own grandparents, great-grandparents, and great-great-grandparents. And each one was once a child like you! So let&#8217;s begin</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_21/cemetery_record.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="246" /></div>
<h1>A Cemetery Record</h1>

<p>First get some supplies:</p>

<ul>
<li>a notepad and pencil</li>

<li>ruler and paper</li>

<li>someone who likes history (maybe Dad or Mom?)</li>

</ul>
<ol>
<li>First ask your history expert for help. Which of your relatives have died? Find out if their gravesights are close enough to visit. If they are too far away, plan a trip to go to a cemetary near you. Remember to bring along your notepad and pencil.</li>

<li>Now let&#8217;s begin our gravestone search! At the cemetary, read what the gravestones say. Many tell the person&#8217;s name, when they were born, and when they died. Write these things in your notebook. If the stone doesn&#8217;t tell you, figure out their age when they died. You&#8217;ll have to do some math for this!</li>

<li>Plan on recording about ten stones. If they are relatives, it will be fun to learn some stories about their lives. Other gravestones to look for are:
<ul>
<li>oldest (who were the first people to be buried here?)</li>

<li>newest (is there a fresh mound of dirt anywhere?)</li>

<li>shortest lived (can you find a child&#8217;s gravestone?)</li>

<li>longest lived (did anyone live past 90? or 100?)</li>

<li>most interesting (I found a stone once that only said &#8220;Brother&#8221;)</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>Make a graph or timeline to show each person&#8217;s life. You could use a ruler and count each 10 years as 1&#8221; to show the length of their life. Make a page for each one. If you can, talk to someone who knew that person. Who were they? How did they live?</li>

<li>Think about this: each person has soul that lives forever. You don&#8217;t know whether your life on earth will be long or short, but that doesn&#8217;t really matter. What is important is <i>what you do</i> with your life. You can live for yourself and lose your soul. Or you can turn from your own ways and ask God to save your soul for heaven. Your selfish, sinful life must be buried away so a new life can begin!</li>

</ol>

<h1>A Good Game</h1>

<p>&#8220;Memory Cards&#8221; is a game you can make to help memorize Bible verses in a fun way. Get a stack of cards that are the same size and color. Use two (or four for if you want to play &#8220;Collections&#8221;) for each verse. One card can have the first part, and the second can have the ending and Bible reference. Play &#8220;Memory Match&#8221; by laying all the cards face down and taking turns flipping two over to find matches. Play &#8220;Collections&#8221; like a &#8220;Go Fish&#8221; game. Try to get the rest of a verse from other players by saying the whole verse or the reference. Make your own rules and have fun!</p>

<h1>Think About It: God Answers Prayer</h1>

<p>Do you wonder if God really hears us when we pray? Think about sad Hannah, who wanted a little baby so much. She prayed to God and He answered her prayers. He gave her little Samuel, which means, &#8220;Asked of God.&#8221; God is a loving Father who wants us to ask Him for things. He knows what will really make us happy. We must never demand our own way, but trust Him to give what is best.</p>

<p>Think of King David who was once a shepherd boy. He asked God to keep him safe many times. God answered his prayers and helped him. David knew God was big enough to take care of all his troubles. Always remember that God is big enough. He listens to those that want his help and need Him.</p>

<p>Cornelius was a man that wanted to do right. He prayed that God would show him the way to live. God answered his prayers and sent an angel to tell him what to do. God&#8217;s ear is always listening for those that want to do right. If we turn from everything that is wrong, God will gladly answer us. He will give us a clean heart and show us His way.</p>

<p>Do you need something? Are you sad, or lonely, or afraid? Pray. Jesus says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Ask, and it shall be given you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+11%3A9" title="Luke 11:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 11:9)</span></a></span>
God cares about you.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_21/Serving_Wrong_or_Right/index.html">Serving Wrong or Right</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Serving Wrong or Right</h1>

<p>&#8220;Mother, why is Grandpa still sick?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother was quiet a moment and Billy watched her face. She looked sort of sad as she replied, &#8220;Billy, Grandpa is not living right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he says he is,&#8221; Billy said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know, but he doesn&#8217;t overcome wrong every day,&#8221; Mother spoke slowly as she looked at him. &#8220;Do you remember when you lied to me because you wanted to go play?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy nodded. He had told Mother that his schoolwork was all finished because he was tired of doing it and wanted to go outside. When Mother had checked his work, he remembered how she had looked at him so sadly. Then she had talked about overcoming. &#8220;It is like a fight,&#8221; she had said. &#8220;Either you win by doing what is right, or the wrong beats you and makes you a slave. You either obey the truth and are a servant of right, or you obey the temptations and are a servant of wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Grandpa letting the wrong beat him?&#8221; Billy asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Mother said, &#8220;for if we obey the temptations even a tiny bit, we are letting the wrong win. We become servants to whoever we obey. That means that either you have right or wrong ruling over you. You obey God and do right, or you disobey Him and sin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What would happen if Grandpa died?&#8221; Billy asked. He already thought he knew, but the idea bothered him and he wanted to see what Mother would say.</p>

<p>&#8220;He couldn&#8217;t get into heaven,&#8221; Mother said sadly, &#8220;for only people who have clean hearts without sin can go there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t God want him to go to heaven?&#8221; asked Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, God wants everybody to go to heaven. He will wash away the sins of anybody who is sorry for doing wrong and will trust God to help them live right. The trouble with Grandpa is that he wants to go to heaven, but he wants to go in his own way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; Billy said, thoughtfully, &#8220;how does he want to go in his own way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t admit that he has wrong in his life,&#8221; Mother said. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t want to see that he is serving wrong. He thinks he is OK, and wants everyone to believe that he loves God and does what is right. I know he is not really happy inside, but he gets mad if we say anything about it. Grandpa wants to think he is right with God, but he doesn&#8217;t really know he is inside.&#8221; Mother put her hand over her heart and looked at Billy closely. &#8220;Do you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded. &#8220;Is that why we pray so often for God to talk to Grandpa&#8217;s heart?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. God loves him and wants him to get saved. I believe that is why he is letting him be sick for so long. God wants him to go to heaven, so He keeps dealing with his heart.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;The Lord is&#8230;&#8203;not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+3%3A9" title="II&nbsp;Peter 3:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 3:9)</span></a></span></p>

<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Princess,</p>

<p>Would you like to hear the story of the Singing Party? It was a cold windy day when Princess Precious got the idea. After lessons she talked it over with Princess Cheerful and Princess Shine, two of her closest buddies. &#8220;Let&#8217;s have a singing party!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Mother Matron has been saying that too many people have been gloomy. I think a party would cheer us all up, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s!&#8221; agreed the other two, and right away they began to plan. They were so busy they hardly noticed the chore-bell. When little Princess Joy skipped in with her duster, they started up in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; Joy asked, curiously.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_21/letter_princesses.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="209" /></div>
<p>The girls exchanged glances and Cheerful said, &#8220;You&#8217;ll see soon.&#8221; So they whispered and wrote notes while the rest of the King&#8217;s family hurried about their work. Finally all the invitations were made and the date set for the following Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>Precious could hardly concentrate on her lessons the rest of the week. &#8220;Are you getting sick?&#8221; asked Mother Matron. &#8220;So many of the girls are coming down with colds&#8212;you really ought to wear your scarves outside on these cold days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Precious only nodded. Her thoughts were all tumbling with the sugar cakes and party streamers she had to make. She just wouldn&#8217;t have time for the Palace Gathering that day. There was too much to do.</p>

<p>When Tuesday came, Precious began to get worried. &#8220;All of the girls in the Sunrise room are sick,&#8221; said Cheerful, &#8220;but I still think some of the others are coming.&#8221; They hurried to tie bows and lay out songbooks and at last everything was ready. As they sat waiting, Joy walked past the door singing, a tray of hot tea in her hands.</p>

<p>Precious frowned after her. &#8220;What is she doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think King Jesus sent her,&#8221; Shine said, looking at her hands. &#8220;I stopped in at the Throne Room and heard Him talking about visiting the sick….&#8221; She looked so dismal that Precious was surprised. What was happening to their wonderful party? Before she could say anything, Cheerful spoke up.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, I think we should go out to sing. We aren&#8217;t going to cheer anyone up just sitting here and having a party by ourselves!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; Shine said eagerly. &#8220;I think that is just what King Jesus wants us to do.&#8221; Precious bit her lip. She knew what had gone wrong. They hadn&#8217;t talked to King Jesus about their party and how He wanted it done. Now He was busy with different plans, and they were left out.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all my fault!&#8221; Precious said, bursting into tears. &#8220;I was too busy to ask King Jesus… or maybe I just didn&#8217;t want to listen to what He would say. Now everything is ruined!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if we go and say we&#8217;re sorry,&#8221; said Cheerful. &#8220;Let&#8217;s just see what His plans are and see if we can help.&#8221; So that is what they did. And don&#8217;t you agree that the King&#8217;s party was the best one of all?</p>

<h1>Dear Reader</h1>

<p>How unsearchable are the ways of our great and mighty King! We began this children&#8217;s paper with a burden to shine a little candle for Jesus, our Master. As month after month went by, we have felt more and more our need of His light burning in us. He alone knows what can be effective to meet your needs, so many of which we know nothing about. We are humbled to depend upon His mercy for each step of the way.</p>

<p>Our burden is summed up in this:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ&#8217;s stead, be ye reconciled to God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+5%3A20" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 5:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 5:20)</span></a></span></p>

<p>We would be glad to hear from any of you. We welcome questions and would be very happy to hear how the Lord has been helping you. For older levels that want to be challenged and encouraged in Christian living, <i>Foundation Truth</i> is also available for youths and adults.</p>

<p>We are a God-fearing family that includes Rick and Krista Erickson, Laura (22), Skye (20), Joel (20), Kara (17), and Amanda (9). The publishing of <i>Treasures of the Kingdom</i> is mainly done by Laura and Joel, with help (guidance, proofreading, and contributions) from others. We appreciate your prayers, for we certainly can&#8217;t do this without God&#8217;s help!</p>
