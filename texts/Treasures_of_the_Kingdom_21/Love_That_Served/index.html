<p>&#8220;Oh, Ed, please don&#8217;t!&#8221; Alice cried, jerking her hair from her brother&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>Grandpa frowned. &#8220;Edward, you know better than to bother your sister.&#8221; As Edward hung his head, Grandpa added, &#8220;Let&#8217;s stop thinking of ourselves. Shall I tell you a story?&#8221;</p>

<p>The children clambered up on his chair and Grandpa began:</p>

<h1>Love That Served</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+12%2C+16%2C+18%2C+19">John 12, 16, 18, 19</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Jesus had come to Jerusalem for the last time. As He stood looking down at the busy city, He felt sad. How many times He had helped and taught and prayed for them! But they didn&#8217;t care: they only wanted Him to be a great king and get rid of all their troubles. How tired He was of all their selfishness and sin! But as Jesus looked at the children waving palms and everyone singing, He smiled. He had come to show God&#8217;s love to them, and He wouldn&#8217;t stop now. He would treat them better than they deserved. His Father would help Him conquer with love.</p>

<p>It was Judas, one of the disciples that had followed Jesus everywhere, that brought the officers to get Him. It was dark when they came into the quiet garden, but Jesus was ready. No, not with an army of angels and swords. No, He had prayed and was ready now to suffer. &#8220;Be not afraid, I have overcome the world,&#8221; Jesus told the disciples. He was ready to die for them.</p>

<p>They chained Him that night and hauled Him down the road like a thief. Jesus didn&#8217;t kick or fight. He stood quietly while the chief priests blamed Him and called Him bad names. He didn&#8217;t snap back or complain. He wasn&#8217;t going to get even. But He prayed. It was hard enough to love people who didn&#8217;t care, and now they beat Him and laughed at His groans. But Jesus thought instead of their sad and guilty hearts. He was going to fight the sin and evil with love.</p>

<p>&#8220;Crucify him!&#8221; the crowd who had sang for Him now screamed, as Jesus stumbled up the road to Golgatha. They were going to nail Him to a cross there. Didn&#8217;t He want to sink down and pray for angels to come? He could have said, &#8220;I have done my best. I am sorry, but I can&#8217;t take it anymore. This is too hard!&#8221; But Jesus set His heart to do what was right, and didn&#8217;t try to escape. The thorns hurt, His back throbbed with pain, but He didn&#8217;t blame that cruel crowd. He was suffering <i>for them</i>, and because He was obedient until death He could say, &#8220;It is finished.&#8221; God&#8217;s plan of salvation was accomplished.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>&#8220;Why did you tell that story?&#8221; asked Alice.</p>

<p>Grandpa smiled. &#8220;I was thinking about Jesus&#8217; sufferings and how we are called to follow in His steps. How can we be like Jesus?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By thinking about others first,&#8221; suggested Edward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, don&#8217;t you think it would be better to keep busy trying to serve others, rather than getting into trouble for being a pest?&#8221; Grandpa said to Edward, his eyes twinkling. &#8220;God is pleased when we do hard things patiently. He will help us be kind when others are cross.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice blushed. &#8220;I think it was for me, too,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am sorry for snapping back at you, Edward. I think Jesus would have spoken in a kinder way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I forgive you,&#8221; said Edward. &#8220;And I&#8217;m sorry for pulling your hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that wasn&#8217;t much compared to being beaten,&#8221; Alice said with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must&#8217;ve been really hard,&#8221; agreed Edward, thoughtfully. &#8220;But Jesus kept loving them and forgiving them. He had to pray for God&#8217;s help, didn&#8217;t He?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess so,&#8221; said Alice. &#8220;And God can help me love others more, too.&#8221;</p>
