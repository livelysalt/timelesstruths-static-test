<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Princess,</p>

<p>Would you like to hear the story of the Singing Party? It was a cold windy day when Princess Precious got the idea. After lessons she talked it over with Princess Cheerful and Princess Shine, two of her closest buddies. &#8220;Let&#8217;s have a singing party!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Mother Matron has been saying that too many people have been gloomy. I think a party would cheer us all up, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s!&#8221; agreed the other two, and right away they began to plan. They were so busy they hardly noticed the chore-bell. When little Princess Joy skipped in with her duster, they started up in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; Joy asked, curiously.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_21/letter_princesses.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="209" /></div>
<p>The girls exchanged glances and Cheerful said, &#8220;You&#8217;ll see soon.&#8221; So they whispered and wrote notes while the rest of the King&#8217;s family hurried about their work. Finally all the invitations were made and the date set for the following Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>Precious could hardly concentrate on her lessons the rest of the week. &#8220;Are you getting sick?&#8221; asked Mother Matron. &#8220;So many of the girls are coming down with colds&#8212;you really ought to wear your scarves outside on these cold days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Precious only nodded. Her thoughts were all tumbling with the sugar cakes and party streamers she had to make. She just wouldn&#8217;t have time for the Palace Gathering that day. There was too much to do.</p>

<p>When Tuesday came, Precious began to get worried. &#8220;All of the girls in the Sunrise room are sick,&#8221; said Cheerful, &#8220;but I still think some of the others are coming.&#8221; They hurried to tie bows and lay out songbooks and at last everything was ready. As they sat waiting, Joy walked past the door singing, a tray of hot tea in her hands.</p>

<p>Precious frowned after her. &#8220;What is she doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think King Jesus sent her,&#8221; Shine said, looking at her hands. &#8220;I stopped in at the Throne Room and heard Him talking about visiting the sick….&#8221; She looked so dismal that Precious was surprised. What was happening to their wonderful party? Before she could say anything, Cheerful spoke up.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, I think we should go out to sing. We aren&#8217;t going to cheer anyone up just sitting here and having a party by ourselves!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; Shine said eagerly. &#8220;I think that is just what King Jesus wants us to do.&#8221; Precious bit her lip. She knew what had gone wrong. They hadn&#8217;t talked to King Jesus about their party and how He wanted it done. Now He was busy with different plans, and they were left out.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all my fault!&#8221; Precious said, bursting into tears. &#8220;I was too busy to ask King Jesus… or maybe I just didn&#8217;t want to listen to what He would say. Now everything is ruined!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if we go and say we&#8217;re sorry,&#8221; said Cheerful. &#8220;Let&#8217;s just see what His plans are and see if we can help.&#8221; So that is what they did. And don&#8217;t you agree that the King&#8217;s party was the best one of all?</p>

<p class="signature">Love,<br />Aunt Faith</p>
