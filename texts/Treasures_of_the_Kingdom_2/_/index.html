<h1>Daniel and the Fishing Trip</h1>

<p>Daniel hurried to pull on his boots. He was excited because today he would get to try out his new fishing rod, which had been given to him on his eighth birthday, last winter. Dad had promised to take big brother, Chad, and him down to Cottonwood Lake to fish today, as soon as they got their chores done.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_2/fishing_pole.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="125" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Can I go, too?&#8221; begged six-year-old Rosie, poking her head around the screen door.</p>

<p>Daniel looked at the long black pole and its shiny silver reel lying on the porch and frowned. He usually liked to play with his sister; but today&#8230;&#8203;well, fishing was for boys. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to stay at home with Emma and play house?&#8221; he asked, hopefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Rosie, shaking her braids determinedly. Just then Dad came around the corner of the house, and she eagerly ran up to him. &#8220;I can go fishing, too, can&#8217;t I, Daddy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t know how,&#8221; put in Daniel. &#8220;And, besides, fishing is for boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dad scratched his head thoughtfully. &#8220;Do you know how to fish?&#8221; he asked Daniel with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Daniel replied quickly, &#8220;but Chad promised to teach me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can learn, too!&#8221; Rosie chimed in.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Daniel tried again, &#8220;girls can&#8217;t fish. And we only have two fishing poles: there won&#8217;t be enough for everyone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dad patted Daniel on the head. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see about that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Right now we need to get ourselves some worms.&#8221; Daniel dragged his feet as he headed toward the van with his fishing rod. Rosie was so noisy that she would surely scare away all the fish. Taking her along would spoil the whole trip!</p>

<p>The water shimmered under a blue sky and red-winged blackbirds flew up from the rushes when Dad drove up to Cottonwood Lake an hour later. Daniel almost forgot his disappointment in the excitement of unloading the van. The lake was large and sure to have many hungry fish just waiting to be caught.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along,&#8221; Dad called when they had all picked up their fishing gear. &#8220;Let&#8217;s follow this path to find a good fishing spot.&#8221; Rosie slipped her hand into his big one and they started out along the shore, with Daniel and Chad following, close behind. Beyond a clump of tall cottonwood trees they found a shady bank that was just perfect.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_2/fishing_Daniel.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="450" /></div>
<p>&#8220;The water is good and deep here,&#8221; Chad remarked, laying down his rod in the grass. &#8220;We should be able to catch some big ones.&#8221; He pulled a worm out of the bait can and began threading it on his hook.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you find a worm, Daniel, I&#8217;ll put it on your hook,&#8221; Dad offered.</p>

<p>&#8220;When can I fish?&#8221; asked Rosie plopping down into the grass beside them.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Daniel&#8217;s pole, so we should let him go first, shouldn&#8217;t we?&#8221; Dad reminded her. &#8220;After he has a chance to catch something, maybe he&#8217;ll let you have a try.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys went down to the waters&#8217; edge, and Chad showed Daniel how to cast out his line. After a few tries Daniel landed his hook and bobber in the deeper water and sat down to wait for a bite. Chad joined him with his pole, and Dad and Rosie sat down to watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;When will they catch a fish?&#8221; wondered Rosie, impatient for something to happen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, sometimes it takes awhile before you get any bites,&#8221; Dad said. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we go exploring a bit while we wait?&#8221; So together they set out along a footpath into a shady clump of trees. Here they found a cool dark pool surrounded by mossy rocks and ferns. Water skaters darted on the surface of the water, and Dad showed Rosie the slow, brown salamanders that lived on the muddy bottom.</p>

<p>Suddenly the stillness was broken by Daniel&#8217;s yelp. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got one! I&#8217;ve got one!&#8221; he called excitedly from the bank. Dad and Rosie hurried back to watch as Chad helped him reel it in and land it on the grass. It was only a small fish, so when Chad hooked a foot-long bass a few minutes later, Daniel was disappointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to try one more time,&#8221; he said, when Rosie asked if she could have her turn now. &#8220;You can share with Chad.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Daniel watched her turn sadly away, his memory verse came back to mind:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+6%3A31" title="Luke 6:31"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 6:31)</span></a></span>
<i>If Rosie had the new pole,</i> he thought, <i>I would want her to share with me.</i> Daniel looked at his little fish and bit the corner of his lip. <i>Jesus would want me to share.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Rosie!&#8221; he called. &#8220;Want me to show you how to fish?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosie came running. &#8220;Really, Daniel? You will?&#8221;</p>

<p>Together they found a fat worm for Dad to bait the hook with. Soon Rosie sat expectantly on the bank with the shiny black pole in her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch, now,&#8221; Daniel cautioned. &#8220;You have to be very quiet or you will scare away the fish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;OK. I will,&#8221; Rosie promised. She sat on the grass bank and watched the round bobber float on the rippling water. Daniel stood beside her and watched, too. They both held their breath as the red and white ball began to wiggle and lurch as something nibbled on the worm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now!&#8221; Daniel ordered as the bobber disappeared. &#8220;Reel it in quick!&#8221; He helped her pull in the line as she cranked the handle with all her might.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Daniel!&#8221; Rosie beamed as they breathlessly landed the slippery silver fish on the grass. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a big one just like Chad&#8217;s!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep.&#8221; Daniel looked at his sister&#8217;s happy face and grinned, &#8220;You&#8217;re a fine fisherman, Rosie, though you are a girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for sharing your rod with me,&#8221; Rosie said, brightly. &#8220;And I couldn&#8217;t have caught it without your help.&#8221; Daniel only smiled as a warm feeling filled his heart.</p>

<h1>Let&#8217;s Give</h1>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Give, and it shall be given unto you&#8230;. for with the same measure that ye mete [measure out] withal it shall be measured to you again.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Like+6%3A38" title="Like 6:38"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Like 6:38)</span></a></span></p>

<p>There was once a boy who was watching his grandma scoop out ice cream for dessert. He thought she was going to give it to his sister and said, &#8220;Not so much, Grandma, not so much!&#8221; When his grandma said that it was for him, he sighed, &#8220;Oh, but it such a little bit.&#8221; So the boy measured the little he thought his sister should have, and received the same amount for himself. Wouldn&#8217;t it have been better if he had not been so selfish?</p>

<p>I want to talk a little while about giving. What did Jesus promise to those that gave? Read the verse again and think about it&#8212;how much we give to others is how much Jesus says we will receive. If we give much, much will be given to us. But if we are selfish to have our own way, how much will be given us then?</p>

<p>Sometimes when we give, we receive things that others may not see. Daniel was given a happy heart when he gave up his own way and shared with his sister. A verse in Acts says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;It is more blessed to give than to receive.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+20%3A35" title="Acts 20:35"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 20:35)</span></a></span>
More happiness comes from giving than from getting. If you will give to others, you will find this to be true. And there is always the reward that Jesus promised. It may be just a happy feeling in your heart, or the smile on someone else&#8217;s face, or even some kindness in return. Most of all, we are promised that we will be given in heaven according to how much we give now.</p>

<p>God Himself gave us a very special gift, His only Son&#8212;Jesus. God was sorry that we were doing wrong, and living bad lives. He knew we needed to be punished, but because He loved us, He sent Jesus to be punished instead.</p>

<p>Do you know that God wants us to give something back to Him? He wants us to give Him our hearts, so that He can make them clean and take out all the wrong. Even though Jesus was punished for us, He can&#8217;t help us do right unless we want Him to. You first have to be sorry and not want to do wrong things any more, because God hates wrong things. Don&#8217;t you want Jesus to give you a clean, good heart instead of your naughty, bad one?</p>

<p>When we give all our heart to God, do you know He gives us more back? He adopts us to be His very own children and live with Him in His Kingdom of Love. Isn&#8217;t that the most beautiful gift of all?</p>

<h1>Salamanders</h1>

<p>Did you know:</p>

<p>Salamanders are one of the three <i>orders</i> (groups) of Amphibians&#8212;cold-blooded animals, that usually start out as plant-eating larvae in water, and metamorphose (change) into animal-eating (e.g. insects, slugs, worms) adults that breath air&#8212;sort of like how caterpillars turn into butterflies. Salamanders live in and near streams and ponds.</p>

<p>There are about 400 <i>species</i> (different kinds) of salamanders in the world, and 127 of those live in the U.S. and Canada.</p>

<p>The southeastern part of the U.S. has the highest density (the most for its size) of salamanders in the world&#8212;over 75 species.</p>

<p>There are usually more salamanders than other vertebrates (animals that have backbones) on forest floors.</p>

<p>The largest salamanders belong to the <i>genus</i> (a group of similar species) called <i>Andrias</i>, that live in central China and Japan, and grow as long as 1.5 meters (about 5 feet).</p>

<p>In our area (the central-eastern Willamette Valley) we have the northern rough-skinned newt, which lives along the Pacific from SE Alaska to San Francisco, CA.</p>

<h2>How to Save Your Own Flower Seeds</h2>
<p>Many flower seeds are easy to save. All you need are some envelopes, a pen or pencil for writing, and a plastic zip-lock bag to keep the seeds dry.</p>

<p>1. First you need to find the flowers you want to save seed from. Some flowers bloom all summer (especially if you remember to pinch off all the old flowers, for then they will grow many more), so it is best to gather their seeds in the fall. Here are some of those kind of flowers:</p>

<ul>
<li>pansies</li>
<li>cosmos</li>
<li>marigolds</li>
<li>snapdragon</li>
<li>petunias</li>
<li>zinnias</li>

</ul>
<p>Some other plants only have flowers for a short time each year, but every year they grow back again. They are called perennials, and you can gather their seeds right after they finish blooming. Some of the common kinds are:</p>

<ul>
<li>columbine</li>
<li>holly</li>
<li>hock</li>
<li>yarrow</li>
<li>Sweet William</li>

</ul>
<p>2. Collect the seeds when the pods or flower heads are dry and brown, but not split open. If you gather them when they are still green, the seeds won&#8217;t save as well. Wait until the plants are dry before you begin to gather the seeds.</p>

<p>3. Place the seeds in an envelope and write the name of the flower on the outside. Each kind of flower should have a different envelope for its seeds. It is also a good idea to write down when you gathered the seed.</p>

<p>4. Keep the seed envelopes in a zip-lock bag to protect them from getting wet. Save your seeds for growing more flowers next spring, and remember to share some with your friends!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Grandpa,&#8221; begged 5-year-old Sammy, crawling onto Grandpa&#8217;s knee, &#8220;we like your stories! Please tell us another one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, do!&#8221; said Alice, who was ten.</p>

<p>Middle-brother Edward hurried over to listen with the others as Grandpa began, &#8220;Here is another tale from the Bible called,</p>

<h1>When God Fought the Enemy</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Kings+18%3A17-19%3A36">II&nbsp;Kings 18:17-19:36</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">This is a story of Jerusalem, the capitol city of Judah, in the days of King Hezekiah. In the city was a boy I will call Amos, and his sister, Debra. They loved their great strong city, and most of all they loved the temple where they worshiped God with their parents and heard stories of how God had been good to them and helped them in so many ways.</p>

<p>But there came an enemy called Rabshakeh with the great army of Assyrians to conquer Judah. He had already conquered the northern kingdom of Israel, because it had disobeyed and forgotten God.</p>

<p>Amos and Debra were a little bit afraid, but they knew that their king was brave. He had made a tunnel to bring water to the city so they wouldn&#8217;t die of thirst if the city was surrounded. They were glad they had a hard-thinking king, but soon they would be glad that they had a hard-praying king.</p>

<p>Rabshakeh soon came with part of the army to camp near Jerusalem. Rabshakeh laughed at the people and said, &#8220;Our gods are better than your God is! We have conquered many lands and their gods didn&#8217;t help them at all. Why should your God help you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon some of the leaders of Jerusalem went out to Rabshakeh and asked him to speak quieter so that the people of the city would not hear him, but he only yelled louder, &#8220;Your God is not good enough. We are going to beat you, so why don&#8217;t you just give up now before we kill you all?&#8221;</p>

<p>Amos looked down and saw the great army of enemy soldiers. He worried, for he had never seen so many soldiers&#8212;there must be thousands and thousands of them! But Debra said, &#8220;Amos, let us pray. God can take care of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the palace, King Hezekiah was praying, too. &#8220;Lord,&#8221; he said, &#8220;see how this enemy is speaking against You. Defend Your name, for it is not right for him to talk like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon God sent them a message from His prophet, Isaiah. The prophet told them not to worry, for the enemy would not be able to even throw a stone at the wall. God promised to send Rabshakeh away so that he would never come back again.</p>

<p>Early in the morning Amos and Debra looked out on the enemy camp. Nothing was happening, and everything was quiet! Some soldiers snuck down to see where the enemy had gone, and found the camp full of dead men! In the night, an angel of the Lord had killed 185,000 enemy soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t our God wonderful?&#8221; Amos said, &#8220;He is so big that He can do anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>Debra smiled, &#8220;Yes, God took care of us because we were obeying Him.&#8221; They were very glad, for the enemy never came back again.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>&#8220;Wow!&#8221; Edward said when Grandpa had finished. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t have to do anything at all, and God just took care of those mean Assyrians.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sammy looked thoughtful. &#8220;They still had to pray, though,&#8221; he said to his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Grandpa said, &#8220;but what else did they have to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>The children thought for awhile before Sammy said, &#8220;They were brave and did not be afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that is because they were obeying God,&#8221; Grandpa reminded them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Edward. &#8220;If they hadn&#8217;t already been obeying God, they probably would have been conquered&#8230;&#8203;like the other kingdom of Israel was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, doesn&#8217;t it say in the Bible that God hears people that obey Him?&#8221; Alice asked.</p>

<p>Grandpa nodded, &#8220;In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+50">Psalm 50</a> it says,
<span class="scripture">&#8216;Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High: And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+50%3A14-15" title="Psalm 50:14-15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 50:14-15)</span></a></span>
When we trust and obey God, we can expect Him to help us in time of trouble.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Something You Can Do</h2>
<p>Summer is here in the northern hemisphere, and the days are hot and sunny. Do you know what you can do? You can make lemonade!</p>

<p>Here is a good recipe that we like to make for a cool drink on hot days. You can make it all by yourself.</p>

<h1>Lemonade</h1>

<p>This is what you will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>a 2-quart pitcher</li>

<li>a 1/3 measuring cup</li>

<li>a long, stirring spoon</li>

<li>white sugar or honey (if you use honey, melt it first)</li>

<li>lemon juice</li>

<li>cool drinking water</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Read all the directions before you start.</li>

<li>Use the <b>1/3 cup</b>. Measure out two flat-topped scoops of <b>sugar</b> (or <b>honey</b>). Pour into the <b>pitcher</b>.</li>

<li>Now use the <b>1/3 cup</b> and fill it with <b>lemon juice</b>. So it won&#8217;t spill on the counter, hold the cup over the pitcher while you pour in the lemon juice. Now pour the <b>lemon juice</b> into the <b>pitcher</b>.</li>

<li>Fill the <b>pitcher</b> half-full of <b>water</b> and stir with the <b>spoon</b>. Keep stirring until the <b>sugar</b> disappears.</li>

<li>Now fill the <b>pitcher</b> almost to the top with <b>water</b>. This time stir it very gently a few times. Be careful not to spill!</li>

<li>Your Lemonade is done! Fill up some <b>tall glasses</b> and serve them to all the <b>hard workers</b> in your home.</li>

<li>Every <b>good worker</b> should clean up the mess afterwards. Before leaving the kitchen put everything away and clean off the counter.</li>

</ul>
<p></p>

<p>Note: If your family likes the lemonade very cold, make this recipe early in the morning and then put the pitcher in the refrigerator until you serve it.</p>

<h2>Save Your Favorite Recipes!</h2>
<p>If there are any foods that you especially like, this is a good time to start collecting recipes. Maybe your grandma, your aunt, or your mom makes something you really like. Ask them nicely to write down the recipe for you. Decide whether you want a recipe book or a card file, then ask someone to help you get started. This is a good idea for girls and boys, because we all enjoy delicious food!</p>

<h2 class="subtitle">that Giving Brings Happiness</h2>
<p>If you read &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_2/Lets_Give/index.html">A View from the Tower: Let&#8217;s Give</a>&#8221;, you will remember how we talked about giving. Jesus told us to give, and promised that we would receive back according to the amount we gave. Most often we will find that Jesus gives us a blessing in our heart when we give. Would you like to share how Jesus helped you to give, and the happiness you got from doing it?</p>

<p>If you can&#8217;t think of anything you&#8217;ve given, it is not too late to begin. There are many things you can give, but the important thing is to give them cheerfully. Sometimes you may have to pray and ask Jesus to help you be a happy giver.</p>

<p>Here are a few little things you can do that can make a big difference:</p>

<ul>
<li>Give a hug to someone that feels sad</li>

<li>Give smiles, and see how many smiles come back to you</li>

<li>When Mommy or Big Sister is busy in the kitchen, give them a helping hand</li>

<li>When Dad or Mom tell you to do something, give them cheerful and quick obedience</li>

<li>If someone wants to play with your toys, give them kindness and share</li>

<li>If your little brother or sister wants to do something with you, give them love and be their buddy</li>

</ul>
<p>This is not a contest, but if you want to tell others how Jesus helped you to give, write it down (or have another person write it down for you) and send it to:</p>

<h1>Guess the Word</h1>

<p>A 7-letter word that is used 27 times in the <a href="../../../bible/New_Testament/_/collection_index.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> (KJV), and 11 times in one book.</p>

<p>One whole chapter in the Bible is designated to declare its worth.</p>

<p>Its Bible meaning is listed last of the dictionary definitions of the word, and it is hardly ever used to mean that today.</p>

<p>All things are suppose to be done with it.</p>

<p>It is suppose to come out of a pure heart.</p>

<p>It is first mentioned in Paul&#8217;s <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians">first letter to the Corinthians</a> and last in the <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation">Revelation of John</a>.</p>

<h1>God Loved Him</h1>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_2/soldier_toys.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="250" /></div>
<p>Once there was a little boy who had no one to love him. His Daddy was not there to love him. His Mother had listened to the devil. The devil does not love anybody, so of course the little boy&#8217;s mother did not love him. She did not even want him, so she left him at a place called the poorhouse where many other children did not have someone to love them. But even though no one loved the little boy, God loved him. God wanted him, and He helped the little boy want to do right. God always does what is right, and He wants us to love to do right, too.</p>

<p>Edwin (for that was the little boy&#8217;s name) had a hard time. The other children were mean to him. They took his food and his toys. They hit him and were not fair to him.</p>

<p>But Edwin wanted to do the right thing. He was still kind to the mean children. He let them take his toys and have the best food, for it was good to do the right thing. But Edwin did not know about God, and he did not know that God loved him.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_2/soldier_dog.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></div>
<p>A kind lady came to the place where Edwin lived. She taught him to say the words, &#8220;Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep.&#8221; Edwin liked to say these words, because it made him happy. But he did not know that this was a prayer, and that he was talking to God.</p>

<p>After awhile Edwin&#8217;s mother took him from the poorhouse to live with her, but she still did not love him. She was mean to him and did not teach him anything. Still, Edwin tried to do what was right. When he was given food for the dog and himself, Edwin shared the food with the dog. He tried very hard to be fair with the dog even though he was very hungry.</p>

<p>There was a kind Mother and Daddy who lived in the next house. They helped Edwin and told him many good things. But they did not know God, so they could not tell him about God.</p>

<p>Still, God&#8217;s eyes were watching Edwin. He protected Edwin from many dangers which could have hurt him badly.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_2/soldier_dad.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="250" /></div>
<p>Edwin grew to be big. Finally, he found out who God was. Edwin lived for God and loved Him. When he became a daddy, he loved his boys and girls, for he loved to do what was right.</p>

<p>You can read a book about Edwin. It is called <a href="../../../texts/The_Poorhouse_Waif/index.html" title="The Poorhouse Waif">The Poorhouse Waif</a>, and it is a true story. It tells how God took care of Edwin.</p>

<p>God will take care of you, too. He will help you to do the right thing if you ask Him. Will you ask God to help you? Do you want to do the right thing?</p>

<p>God&#8217;s eyes are watching you, too. They are watching you all the time: when you are awake and when you are asleep. God wants you to do what is right all the time, for He is sad if you do wrong.</p>

<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">My dear girls,</p>

<p>How is your gown of obedience looking? I hope it is a beautiful dress, with not a black stitch in it. How would you like to make it more beautiful by adding to it sparkling pearls, rubies, and diamonds? Our King Jesus delights in giving jewels to His daughters, but they are not the kind that you can buy in the store. In fact, He doesn&#8217;t even like those kind of jewels at all. He gives us more beautiful and better jewels than any kind you can buy. Would you like to get some of them to adorn your golden dress of obedience?</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with one of the best jewels you could possibly have. It is called charity, or love, and King Jesus said it was the loveliest thing His princess could ever have on.</p>

<p>It is a simple jewel, pure white, without a blemish and goes upon the head, like a shining crown.</p>

<p>How can we get this wonderful jewel? There is only <b>one</b> way. We must go to our Father, King Jesus, and plead for the jewel of love. He will give it to us, for He said He would.</p>

<p>It is a wonderful thing to have the jewel of love. The jewel of love will help us to do the dishes for Mama when she is tired, or be kind to our little sister when she gets into our things.</p>

<p>Once there was a Princess Precious who had asked King Jesus if she might have the jewel of love, and He had given it to her. Then one day, little sister Joy was playing with her china tea set. It was a very nice china tea set with little tiny rosebuds painted on the sides of the cups. Princess Precious had told Joy to be very, very careful&#8230;&#8203;and then she left the room to sweep the floor for Mama. The next thing she knew there was a loud <i>crash</i>, and all that was left of the tea set were broken pieces, with little Joy crying in the middle. Princess Precious felt like crying too. Why did Joy have to be so careless? Then, just as impatience and anger towards her little sister began to creep in her thoughts, King Jesus whispered, &#8220;Precious, take the jewel of love that I have for you, and you will love your sister, even though she has done this.&#8221; And Princess Precious did lift up her hands for the gift of love that King Jesus had given her. She brushed Joy off gently, and spoke gentle, loving words, that spilled over from her crown of love.</p>

<p>Are you the Princess Precious? I hope so, for each one of you are certainly precious in your Heavenly Father&#8217;s sight and may act just as sweetly as Princess Precious if you seek your Father&#8217;s free gift of the jewel love.</p>

<p class="signature">With love in Jesus,<br />Aunt Grace</p>

<p>We are a Bible-believing family that belongs to the church God built in the New Testament. Our family includes Rick and Krista Erickson and their five children: Laura (18), Skye (17), Joel (17), Kara (14), and Amanda (6). We live on a small acreage, and are home educated. The publishing of Treasures of the Kingdom is mainly done by Laura and Joel, with help from others, including contributions from our friends, the Spinks family, and guidance by our parents.</p>

<p>We have been encouraged in the Lord by your notes, and do thank you for them. We would appreciate your prayers as we continue laboring for Him in this field. The Lord has been so good to us&#8212;in Him we do trust (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+9%3A8">II&nbsp;Corinthians 9:8</a>).</p>
