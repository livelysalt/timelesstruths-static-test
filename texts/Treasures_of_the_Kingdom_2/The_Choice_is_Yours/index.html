<h3><a name="9"></a>#9. You and Alex manage to get back to the dock, and you dry off in the sun. Then you both go find Uncle Billy. <a href="#20">Go to #20</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="10"></a>#10. As you hike along together, you come to a fence. The others want to cross it, but Uncle Billy warned you not to last time you were here.</h3>
<ul>

<h3><a name="14"></a>#14. As you cross a pasture, a mean-looking cow starts coming your way. As you try to get back to the fence, you rip your clothes on some wire, and fall in the mud. <a href="#24">Go to #24</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="15"></a>#15. As you are leaving the dock, you remember that you are supposed to wear a life-jacket.</h3>

<h3><a name="17"></a>#17. Mom sees you sitting around, so she calls you in to wash dishes. You have a grumpy attitude and get disciplined. You know you deserve it, and ask Jesus to help you do the right thing from now on. <a href="#7">Go to #7</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="18"></a>#18. Though it is a tight squeeze, and you get dirty, you are able to get the ball. Everyone is happy, and you decide to go wading in the creek to cool off. <a href="#26">Go to #26</a>.</h3>

</ul>
<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_2/choice_shed.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="125" /></div>
<h3><a name="21"></a>#21. Soon the ball rolls under an old shed. The space is only big enough for you to crawl in, so the others ask you to get it. It looks dark and scary.</h3>
