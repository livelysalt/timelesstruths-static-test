<h1>What is <i>Dear Princess</i>?</h1>

<p><i>Dear Princess</i> is a newsletter for young girls who seek and strive to please their Father, the King. It was started to encourage young girls in pursuing after the things of righteousness, growing in grace and becoming Godly young women. Most young ladies have the desire, Lord-willing, to become a wife and mother someday. To prepare for the future, we need to develop homemaking skills. Mothers and Grandmothers are very welcome to write in to encourage and teach us younger women.</p>

<p>This publication is free to anyone who request it. It is sent out prayerfully as the Lord lays upon my heart to do so. (About quarterly.) Stories, poems, articles, recipes, and letters are always welcome. If the Lord has blessed you with any special thought, send it in. Share your blessing with others that they may be blessed, too!</p>

<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
<p><i>Dear Princess</i> is published by Abigail Spinks with my family&#8217;s help. My parents proofread each newsletter several times, and I am thankful for their loving guidance. I also want to thank Claire, Laura, Coquetta, Kara, and Skye, for their help in this issue. Even though articles like Sister Jenny Rutty wrote, were written over a hundred years ago, we can still get the good from them. I am so thankful that we were able to get a hold of her book, <i>Letters of Love and Counsel for &#8220;Our Girls&#8221;</i>. Lord willing, we are planning to make it a regular column. I desire your prayers as I send out this newsletter. I wish to do only what the Lord wants done.</p>

<h1>From the Editor</h1>

<p class="noindent">May 21, 1997</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Readers,</p>

<p>Greetings in Jesus&#8217; precious name! I want to share some things the Lord has been blessing me with, to encourage your hearts. This April we went back Midwest and South for a visit to some relatives. We didn&#8217;t know we were going till the week before, so it was quite a surprise to all of us that we were going to be able to go. Well, the devil started whispering to me, &#8220;What if Missy and Jenny [my foster sisters] call or try to get a hold of you when you are gone?&#8221; We hadn&#8217;t had <i>any</i> contact with them for 10 months. And the devil hadn&#8217;t been idle during that time. He tried hard to get me down and discouraged about them. When he whispered that in my ear, I refused to listen to it, though it still bothered me. I began to ask the Lord that, if he saw fit, He would let us get in contact before we left on our trip.</p>

<p>Two days before we left, on a Sunday afternoon, a huge semi truck pulled into our street. We live in a quiet neighborhood where usually we don&#8217;t see semis. We noticed, but didn&#8217;t think much about it. The semi sat there about 15 minutes. After that period of time, a man got out of the truck and started up our drive.</p>

<p>At first none of us recognized him, but soon we realized that he was Missy and Jenny&#8217;s dad! He gave us their address and phone number, and, since that time, we have been able to get a hold of them.</p>

<p>It seems like I can never thank God enough for letting us get in contact with them again <i>and</i> answering my prayer before our trip! The Lord didn&#8217;t have to let me know before the trip. He could have waited till after, just so I could see that He would take care of everything, despite my worries or fears. But He went ahead and let me know anyway. The Lord is so worthy of our trust&#8212;much more worthy then we usually give Him credit. I am reminded of a song, <a href="../../../music/Tis_So_Sweet_to_Trust_in_Jesus/index.html" title="Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus">&#8217;Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus&#8221;</a>:</p>

<p class="verse">&#8217;Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus<br />Just to take Him at His word;<br />Just to rest upon His promise,<br />Just to know, &#8220;Thus saith the Lord.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse refrain_line">Refrain:</p><p class="verse refrain">Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!<br />How I&#8217;ve proved Him o&#8217;er and o&#8217;er!<br />Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!<br />Oh, for grace to trust Him more!</p>

<p class="verse">O how sweet to trust in Jesus,<br />Just to trust his cleansing blood;<br />Just in simple faith to plunge me<br />&#8217;Neath the healing, cleansing flood!</p>

<p class="verse">Yes, &#8217;tis sweet to trust in Jesus,<br />Just from sin and self cease;<br />Just from Jesus simply taking<br />Life and rest, and joy and peace.</p>

<p>Yes, all we need to do is to trust in Him. &#8220;Just to rest upon His promise.&#8221; He takes care of <i>everything</i>! Some people are apt to say, &#8220;Well, couldn&#8217;t you try this?&#8221; or, &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you try that?&#8221; The Lord wants us to just wait for His timing, not for us to try to go ahead and &#8220;put our hands in the dough,&#8221; so to speak. We tried to get a hold of missy and Jenny, but we weren&#8217;t able to. I thought that we should be able to find them&#8212;I thought the Lord would want us to, right then. But the Lord had a different plan. He wanted us to wait on Him. He wanted to show us what He could do&#8212;as soon as we let go and let Him take over. I want to encourage you, dear sisters, to wait on the Lord for His timing&#8212;it is so much more of a blessing when you give your desires to God and stop the &#8220;pushing.&#8221; Usually, if we push long enough, we get what we want. But we don&#8217;t get a blessing by doing it that way, do we? And, somehow, the thing that looked so desirous when we were pushing for it, doesn&#8217;t look so attractive when we finally get it. If you think you must needs push because the Lord has perhaps forgotten about your need, you are wasting your time. The Lord doesn&#8217;t do things under pressure. He just refuses to. We aren&#8217;t going to help the Lord by trying to hurry things up a bit. The longer we try to &#8220;make it work,&#8221; the longer the Lord leaves us alone with our problem. The Lord just waits quietly till we are ready to give it up to Him&#8212;usually after we have complicated the problem a lot more. God wants us to simple trust Him&#8212;not try to mix in our own feeble efforts.</p>

<p>Sometimes the devil bothers me, saying, &#8220;Well, if you don&#8217;t something&#8230;. You have to say something so that they know you didn&#8217;t mean that&#8230;&#8203;If you don&#8217;t do something about that situation, it&#8217;s going to get our of your control&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, you know, one time the devil told me that the situation was getting out from under my control [my wishes, plans], and the Lord just spoke to me and said, &#8220;That&#8217;s what you need, just let go of the controls, and give them to Me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sometimes it may seem rather fearful to just let loose and give the controls up to God. But really, if we don&#8217;t give them up, we are going to crash. When we can&#8217;t just give the controls over, it shows a lacking in our lives&#8212;we can&#8217;t trust God completely. Isn&#8217;t it strange to think that we sometimes have struggles over giving things up to God, when He made the earth, knows us better than we know ourselves, and gives us His promise that everything He does is for our good (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A28">Romans 8:28</a>)?</p>

<p>A few week ago I was feeling very burdened down with the busyness of the summer and the many activities and commitments that I&#8217;d agreed to. I felt very down and struggled though everyday. I felt I had the responsibility to see that things worked right, and of course I could not do that. I was <i>not</i> my responsibility. It was God&#8217;s. And as soon as I humbled down enough to see that and give my problems to God, I felt <i>so</i> much better. My problems were not huge mountains anymore; just little mole holes that God took care of so easily. My secret in once again being happy in the Lord was giving God the controls.</p>

<p>The other day I was listening to a tape (Oak Grove Quartet), and there was a song that was especially encouraging. The part that really stood out to me was where it said, &#8220;so through all of your trials and all of your fears, remember God has it under control.&#8221; As I thought about it, I realized how foolish it is for us to feel like we have to do something for it to &#8220;work right.&#8221; God has it all planned out. He has it under control. He needs no help from us, He can manage things perfectly. I desire your prayers in the area of my life. The devil tries to worry me about what the situation could turn out to be if I don&#8217;t put my &#8220;two cents&#8221; in. But, by the grace of God, I am learning how to be a giver-upper of my way, and a truster!</p>

<p class="signature">In His love,<br />Abigail</p>

<h2>Freezing corn</h2>
<p>A few years ago, when we were in a hurry to get ready for a trip and the corn needed to be frozen, Mommy had inspriation, instead of husking, and blanching the ears, she just put them bags&#8212;right from the garden. No husking or blanching. We were able to get 100 ears done in a half an hour! And the corn tastes a lot fresher when frozen that way.</p>

<h1>God&#8217;s <i>Berry</i> Good Blessings</h1>

<p class="author">Abigail Spinks</p>

<p>Summer sure is a busy time isn&#8217;t it? The following isn&#8217;t exactly an episode, but I thought I&#8217;d share a little of how our week has gone for canning and freezing.</p>

<p>Thursday morning Coquetta, Mommy, and myself set out for the berry field to pick raspberries. We picked and picked and picked. We talked as we worked and we had a good and profitable conversation. Finally in the afternoon we took one last look at those beautiful berries and headed home (we all have the same problem; we can&#8217;t bear to see those &#8220;perfect&#8221; berries wasted!). Well, anyway, we were all tired, hungry, hot and sticky. As soon as we had had something to eat, we started on canning raspberry sauce. Coquetta and Mommy made the sauce; I put it into jars. While they finished sealing them and putting them in a hot water bath, I packed the remainder of berries on containers for freezing. We were still working on canning and freezing when I noticed that it was almost time for prayer meeting and the house was a wreck! (Prayer meeting is at our house!) I cleaned up a little of the house so it looked presentable, and then hastened to finish my job. Just before they arrived, I took a cold shower (it was very hot outside), and then returned to help in the kitchen. What the blessing was, was that a lot of the jars sealed just as soon as they came out of the canner. The Lord is mindful of our needs even in temporal things.</p>

<p>The next day, Friday, brought more canning. All morning we picked cherries. We had planned to pick cherries at a farm that had them for 10 cents a pound. But when Mommy called, they did not really want us to come. We did not feel right in pushing the matter farther so we just dropped it. I had wanted to get pie cherries, so Mommy thought we would just go on to another place and pick them. In her heart she had really wanted some Bing cherries that Daddy especially liked. But she committed her desires to God.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the orchard, we were surprised to see that the desired cherries were still there, though high in the trees. We found ladders and climbed up to get them. After a lot of hard work of climbing trees, we got enough cherries. And then we went on to pick pie cherries. As we neared the place (the whole orchard was huge), we saw that there were two trees that were just loaded! I mean loaded! You could pick and pick on one tree and there were still more just ready and waiting for you. The tree looked like a red mass all over and I&#8217;m not exaggerating! It seemed like the Lord knew we were tired and led us to those trees where there was so much fruit and so easy to get. And the fruit was perfect&#8212;plump, juicy and red. When we where through picking, the owner said we could have them for 25 cents a pound instead of 50 cents like he had been charging. So now, they are all canned and though tired we are happy and thankful for God&#8217;s bountiful blessings toward us! God bless you all in your busy summer!</p>

<h1>Following in His Steps</h1>

<h2 class="subtitle">Getting acquainted with Laura, Skye, and Kara Erickson.</h2>
<hr class="minor" />
<h2>Please tell us about yourself, your interests, goals, and values.</h2>
<p class="noindent"><b>Laura:</b> My full name is Laura Sigrid Erickson and I will be seventeen in September. I am five feet 5 1/2 inches tall, have blond (now turning brown) hair, blue eyes, and freckles. This year I acquired a new dimension&#8212;glasses. It took me a little while to get used to them, but now they seem part of myself.</p>

<p>My interests are sewing, cooking, gardening, reading, art, animals, and planning. We make most of our clothes (dresses, nightgowns, slips) and so there is plenty of opportunity to sew. Often two of us work on it together which is much more enjoyable. Each of us children have a garden plot this year that we plant and take care of. Since I have been gardening longer than the rest, I am often asked to help or give information&#8212;though I don&#8217;t always know the answers, either! I am also employed in teaching school to Skye, Joel, and Kara which I enjoy most of the time. (smile)</p>

<p>The top priority goal for me is to love, obey, and trust my Lord and Savior. Lord willing, I would love to marry and raise a large family (I love children) and live in the country. I also enjoy simple living and farm life. The Lord might have other plans for me, so I shall not set my heart on dreams of the future.</p>

<p>I value highly those saints that have stayed true to the Lord all the way, but my master blueprint is Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Skye:</b> My full name is Skye Louise Erickson. I am 5&#8217; tall and have brown, almost black hair and eyes. My birthday is January 2, 1982. (I can hardly believe that I will be turning 16 in January! I used to think l6 was <i>so</i> big, but I hardly think so now! Smile.) Some of my interests are: our animals&#8212;learning how to take care of them properly, card making, writing pen pals, gardening, and other odd things.</p>

<p>I am aspiring toward Biblical womanhood&#8212;to be all glorious within&#8212;and a Proverbs 31 woman. Lord willing, I would someday love to marry and raise a family. I would love to live on a farm or ranch, but this desire must be left in the hands of the Lord. In the meantime, I am trying to master homemaking skills. My goal is to build a strong, concrete foundation in the Lord and to grow in Him and like Him each day. My heart&#8217;s desire is to live a life completely yielded to His will. I value very much other saints who have walked in the light the Lord has given them and have lived a consecrated life before Him. It has inspired me very much!</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Kara:</b> My full name is Kara Maru Erickson. I am 5 ft. 4 in. tall and have blond hair and blue eyes. My birthday is February 28. I spend a lot of my time outdoors and enjoy all kinds of animals but I especially like chickens and goats. I also like playing the piano, especially hymns and pretty classical music. One of my joys is organizing. Sometimes it is hard for me to see things in the same place for a long time. Another thing I like to do is to be with younger children.</p>

<p>My first goal in life is to be more like Christ. If the Lord be willing, I would like to be a homemaker and live on a farm. I like the idea of using kerosene lamps instead of electricity, and a pump instead of running water (just as they did in the olden days). But all these things I leave in the bands of the Lord. I value living a life pleasing in the sight of the Lord. I believe that we should follow God&#8217;s leading instead of men&#8217;s. I value people who make the world a better place by living a life in the service of the Chief Shepherd.</p>

<h2>What is a typical day at your home?</h2>
<p class="noindent"><b>Skye:</b> A typical day?! I truly believe that each day is different for us&#8212;there are never two of the same! So, why don&#8217;t I tell you about yesterday:</p>

<p>Thursday June 5, 1997&#8230;. My day started at 5 am, by taking a shower. After my shower (which is about 5:20-5:45), I had my personal devotions. If there&#8217;s any time between my devotions and family devotions, I like to jump on the computer and try to finish a letter or article. 6:30 am came around and everyone headed to the living room for family devotions. Uncle Rick being at work already, we all shared our personal devotions. At 7:10 we all headed to the table for breakfast. 7:30 am found us doing our chores and heading Out to take care of our animals. About 8:00 am, my dear aunt Becky from Mexico called and said that she sold the farm and was going to live up here for a year at least, Lord willing. 9:00 am we met at the table once again to pray for our school day. School followed, of course. We are learning sign language! 12:00 pm Uncle Rick came HOME!!! Yippeeeeee!! Because of being called into work at 3:00 am, he was able to leave for home early. We ate lunch shortly after he got home and then both he and Amanda took naps. I then jumped onto the computer once again to try and work on an article for our newsletter, but with everyone talking (because of another phone call, from Aunt Louise), I couldn&#8217;t think. Going into the bedroom, I finished up on a card order (all the time looking anxiously at my watch to see when 4:00, pm would come around. Why? You&#8217;ll see!) It was around 3:30 pm when I got on the computer once again to write a letter to an old pen friend who was on my mind. Sure enough, Uncle Rick was up and out at 4:00 pm, ready to call the Barcus family! We called in Laura&#8212;in the meantime, I was getting all nervous, I had butterflies in my stomach, my heart was racing, my blood pressure, I&#8217;m sure, was going up and up, for Laura and I were going to talk to Leah to tell her Happy Birthday! (&#8220;Ahhhh, <i>what</i> do I say?!&#8221;) We both got on the phone and had a nice conversation with Stephanie and Leah. About 10 minutes later, we left to Nichol&#8217;s nursery to pick up some plants and beans. By 6:00 pm we arrived at the Spinkses&#8217; house for prayer meeting. At 9:00 pm we were found in bed; lights out and talking (as usual!). And thus, we ended our day.</p>

<h2>Are there any special blessing you received from the Lord that you&#8217;d like to share?</h2>
<p class="noindent"><b>Laura:</b> God has so richly blessed us that I hardly know where to start! One special blessing for me has been my relationship with my sisters. Truly it is a gift of God to have a close friendship with the members of your family! I believe God meant that we should encourage, exhort, and cherish each other rather than complain, fight, and hate one another as, sadly, so many do. I am thankful that, by the grace of God, we have been able to look past the differences and learn to truly value and appreciate each other. It doesn&#8217;t happen overnight though, but only by humbly seeking God&#8217;s help and applying the verse
<span class="scripture">&#8220;let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+1%3A19" title="James 1:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 1:19)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Skye:</b> For many months now, I have been corresponding with many girls all across the United States. Just recently, the Lord has shown me&#8212;out of the blue&#8212;that this is the ministry that God has given me. He&#8217;s given me a gift of being able to write quickly and express my thoughts that would be helpful and encouraging on paper. I realize that not many people have this gift, and I see what a precious gift this can be, if used to His honor and glory! He has given me many precious sisters in the Lord, who are a big encouragement and blessing to me!</p>

<p>I also realize that it is easy to form outside friendships and forget to build a strong relationship with your own siblings, but the Lord has also had a hand in that. Many months ago, Laura, Kara, and I were constantly clashing&#8212;I guess this is a little exaggerated&#8212;but there wasn&#8217;t perfect harmony in our friendships. We all were trials to each other, <i>but</i>&#8230;&#8203;out of these trials we have grown close, very close to each other as well as to the Lord. There has been many rich blessings from the Lord out of these trials and conflicts. Praise Him! Laura, Kara, and I, as well as Amanda, are all best friends. Each day, our love for each other grows stronger even amidst the trials!</p>

<h2>Please tell us about your family.</h2>
<p class="noindent"><b>Laura:</b> Daddy is quiet and timid by nature, and the Lord has helped him greatly in being the spiritual leader and father of the home. His parents were missionaries in Thailand and Burma (Myanmar) when he was young. He is a good storyteller and remembers many interesting and amusing things about his boyhood. We each have an evening with Daddy once a week, which has helped us in developing a close relationship with him, and gives us a time to share our trials and victories, plans and disappointments. He is a very understanding and caring person. Though hoping sometime to be able to work at home, right now Daddy works for the state in Salem (about 25 minutes drive away).</p>

<p>Mommy is a good balance for him, being a little more outgoing and engaging person. She loves to plan ways to fix up the place, is a hard worker (getting that from Grandpa), and a perfectionist. She also grew up overseas in India where her father and mother were medical missionaries. Mommy has been a encouragement and help to me and is faithfully teaching us girls the skills of a homemaker.</p>

<p class="noindent">(<b>Skye writing about Laura:</b>) Laura (16, almost 17) is a lot like Uncle Rick in her loving acts of kindness; always cheerfully ready to help out and learn; always teaching us new things and trying to make it interesting for her easily bored students! Smile. Through time, I have seen how the Lord has wonderfully worked in her life; perfecting and refining her. Her light has brightly shined before me and has been an inspiration to me. I go to Laura with all my &#8220;help me&#8217;s&#8221; and, &#8220;why is this?&#8221; and she&#8217;s always willing to answer my questions and help me out! She is very good with children&#8212;always patient in letting them &#8220;be involved&#8221; and has good judgment on how to deal with them. She often gets me up and going out of discouragements and God has used her many a time to cheer me up and comfort me with appropriate scriptures. I thank the Lord for my precious sister, Laura!</p>

<p>Skye (15) is bubbly and outgoing, but can also be quiet and reserved. Often she and Kara engage in lively games and plans together. From the first bummer lamb she has loved sheep and is diligent in overseeing that they are properly cared for. She is also our &#8220;van washer&#8221; and loves to have things very clean. With her bubbly disposition Skye has earned the nickname &#8220;Sparkles.&#8221; As she mentioned she has a great gift with letter writing and has recently begun a hobby of card making. With amazement I have watched interests in sewing, cooking, gardening, and &#8220;mothering&#8221; blossom in her where there were none before. She often says we are so alike that many times I say what she was thinking!</p>

<p>Joel (14, almost 15) is much like Daddy in quietness and slowness, but gets his perfectionist personality from Mommy. He adjusts amazingly well in a family with four sisters, though often shakes his head at our &#8220;absurd&#8221; ideas or notions. He likes to plan property improvements with Mommy to be carried out with perfection. Like Daddy, Joel is very good at math and computers and also enjoys carpentry. We often swamp him with things to be built, fixed, or helped with (he shares my feeling of being always needed). Growing up we always did things together, Kara tagging along of course. We planned, built, and played together and still do many things together.</p>

<p>Kara (12) is the animal lover, organizer, and surprise maker. Her first animals were chickens and goats and those are still her favorites, especially chickens. She was always curious to see things, and wants to help every injured animal. Her gift at organizing and surprising often go together. Kara loves things neat, and would rearrange everything often if she could. She has a similar personality to Mommy in many ways, one being she wants to help others and often has the neighbor children over to read a story to and play with. Kara is good with keeping children occupied and many times we rely on her for that.</p>

<p>Amanda (4) is a prayed-for sister and keeps us all young and playful (not that we naturally aren&#8217;t). She always wants to do what we are doing and likes us to do things with her. One trial for her is taking her afternoon nap (or rest), though she is doing better with that. She is a very helpful errand girl and we often ask for her assistance. Amanda completes our family very well and we enjoy her fun-loving personality.</p>

<h2>Would you mind sharing a favorite book, poem or recipe?</h2>
<p class="noindent"><b>Laura:</b> For a main dish one of our favorites is a simple rice pilaf. It is made with seasoned rice, cooked ground beef or turkey, and peas mixed together.</p>

<p>I enjoy experimenting with new recipes, especially desserts made with fruit sweetener or honey. One book that has many delicious recipes is called Fruit-Sweet and Sugar-Fruit by Janice Feuer.</p>

<p>Here is a cookie recipe that I developed and Skye perfected.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<h2>Nut Butter Cookies</h2>
<p>Mix:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>1 c. honey</li>

<li>1 t. barley malt</li>

<li>1 1/4 c. ground nuts</li>

<li>2 eggs</li>

<li>3/4 c. oil<br />2 t. vanilla<br />1 c. mashed banana (1 medium size)<br />1/4 c. coconut</li>

</ul>
<p>Add:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>2 c. rice flour (or wheat)</li>

<li>1 t. soda</li>

<li>1/2 c. oat flour</li>

<li>1 t. salt</li>

<li>1 c. barley or oat flakes<br />carob chips (optional)</li>

</ul>
<p>The batter will be softer than normal cookies. Bake at 350 degrees for 12 minutes. Makes about 4 dozen medium sized cookies.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p class="noindent"><b>Skye:</b> (Yikes!) OK, let me think I have many, many, many favorite verses, but I think the one that ranks the highest is
<span class="scripture">&#8220;My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+12%3A9" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 12:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 12:9)</span></a></span>
In our walk with the Lord, we need a lot of grace to bear up and love each other, to forgive, and not to get annoyed with little things. What a precious promise&#8212;
<span class="scripture">&#8220;my grace is sufficient for thee.&#8221;</span>
He has abundant grace for us if we would only look to Him and ask for it.</p>

<p>I also have a poem, that I find very encouraging and feel blessed in sharing it.</p>

<p class="verse">As men seek for hidden treasure,<br />As for rain thirsts the drying sod,<br />As the hart pants after water,<br />So my heart pants after God.</p>

<p class="verse">I seek not for worldly pleasure,<br />I pray not for earthly store;<br />My whole soul goes after Jesus&#8212;<br />I am seeking nothing more.</p>

<p class="verse">Oh, to be holy, holy, holy,<br />Like my Savior every day,<br />To be filled with all His fullness,<br />&#8217;Tis for this I pray and pray.<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../texts/Helps_to_Holy_Living/Proem/index.html" title="Helps to Holy Living/Proem">*</a></p>

<p class="verse">&#8212;Charles E. Orr</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Kara:</b> One of my favorite books is called <i>Light from Heaven</i>. It is about a boy named Joseph and his struggle in life with a father who didn&#8217;t love him. Without his mother living a godly life before him he would have let bitterness and resentment rule his life. The author of this book is Christmas Carol Kauffman.</p>

<p>One of my many favorite songs is:</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<h2>This Is Why I Love My Savior</h2>
<p class="verse">Shall I tell you why I ceased from folly?<br />Why I turned away from sin?<br />Twas because the love of my Redeemer<br />Fully won my heart to Him.</p>

<p class="verse">Do you ask me why I seek no pleasure<br />In the things I once did love?<br />&#8217;Tis because I&#8217;ve tasted life&#8217;s pure river,<br />Flowing from the throne above.</p>

<p class="verse">Would you bid me give to all a reason<br />Of the hope I now possess?<br />It is Christ in me, the hope of glory,<br />And His perfect holiness.</p>

<p class="verse">Though all men may look on me with wonder,<br />At the change that&#8217;s taken place;<br />I will walk the downward road no longer,<br />Bless the Lord for saving grace.</p>

<p class="verse refrain_line">Refrain:</p><p class="verse refrain">This is why I love my Savior,<br />Why I love to follow Him;<br />For He died my soul to ransom,<br />And He washed me from my sin.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<h2>In conclusion, is there something else you would like to add?</h2>
<p class="noindent"><b>Laura:</b> I hope this will be a blessing and encouragement to others who are seeking to follow the Lord all the way. I would love to write to any girl that has similar interests, but most importantly with a desire to share and encourage one another on the narrow way. May God bless you as you follow in His steps.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Skye:</b> I am very thankful for how the Lord has been helping me; bringing me through many trials and bestowing many blessings! He has been very good to me; calling me, bringing me closer to Him and finally winning His way to my heart. I have never once regretted my choice to live for God&#8212;it is a great <i>joy</i>!</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Kara:</b> I have had two girls over at my house for a few days and the Lord laid a burden on my heart for their souls. Their names are Amanda and Heather Lyon. I have been reading a story before we play and it seems to bless them some but what they really need is help from the Lord. Please keep them in your prayers.</p>

<p class="noindent first">From Abigail&#8217;s Mother:</p>

<p>As a young woman I heard about an old, out-of-print book entitled, <i>Letters of Love and Counsel for Our Girls</i>, by Jennie C. Rutty. I have desired to read its contents and, just recently, some dear folks loaned us a copy. Isn&#8217;t the Lord gracious! He knew my desire, and granted it just at the right time in my own girls&#8217; lives!</p>

<p>I appreciat Sister Rutty&#8217;s burden for girls. She mentioned in the introduction that she &#8220;wondered why her heart was so moved with tenderest emotions towards girls&#8212;sweetbuds of womanhood.&#8221; I believe she was called of God to write to the girls of her generation and for all who were to follow.</p>

<p>We pray these letters, penned over one hundred years ago, will be a blessing to you.</p>

<p>&#8212;Elois Spinks</p>

</div>


<h1>From <i>Letters of Love and Counsel for &#8220;Our Girls&#8221;</i></h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Girls:</p>

<p>We will have some precious seasons of thinking together upon different subjects, and our first letter will be upon a very important one that needs very careful thought. Now when you have read it, will you spend some time in bringing it before you in every wise way, and then walk in wisdom&#8217;s ways?</p>

<p>Life is one thing you all possess, and as it is counted the most precious natural gift, in this you are all equally rich. &#8220;All that a man hath will he give for his life.&#8221; Your life is given to you by our heavenly Father for a purpose. Yes, your life, whoever you may be or whatever you are, your life is given for your good and His glory. There is a way you may spend it that its influence will be for good to all with whom you associate, will be for your own present and eternal good; and, oh, such a sweet, precious thought&#8212;will be for the glory of God.</p>

<p>Many take up life carelessly and move along just like those do who surround them, and in this way form a part of the great tide of humanity who are flowing on to eternity unheeding the warnings and remonstrances of God in many of the circumstances of their lives, and by the still small voice that speaks to them in hours of quietness or sorrow or in the height of gaiety, saying, &#8220;Choose Me, for I have chosen you.&#8221;</p>

<p>It makes me think of some small object lying on the banks of the Niagara River. A little swell carries it off the shore to play along the banks, in and out of the eddies and whirls, gaining greater velocity and pushed further and further from shore, until it is carried by the mighty power of the rushing torrents of water over the great precipice.</p>

<p>Many a young life is wrecked by thoughtlessly entering upon life as others do, not meaning to do wrong but just naturally living out the life that seems the most attractive to them. The wise man does not enter upon any undertaking without careful thought and accurate calculation. If this is best in things pertaining to this life, how much more necessary where eternity is in view!
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For&#8230;&#8203;godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+4%3A8" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 4:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 4:8)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Then, dear girls, will you carefully consider this precious gift of life, and leaning not to your own understanding, ask help from God, that your lives may be wisely spent for your good and the glory of God?</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;The fear of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> is the beginning of wisdom.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+9%3A10" title="Proverbs 9:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 9:10)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Come, ye children, harken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>. What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good? Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+34%3A11-14" title="Psalm 34:11-14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 34:11-14)</span></a></span></p>

<p>As our Creator has given us minds to use, we are accountable therefore, and unthoughtfulness will not excuse us before him. This is one great fault with our young folks. So you need, dear girls, to cast it off and become earnest and thoughtful. While you each have life now, it may not be for many days, months, or years; and you may have very short time for the most important thought. As we are living and counseling you for your good, after you have read this letter do not continue in the same course of life, unless it is in every way the wisest and best.</p>

<p>There are some very earnest and weighty thoughts given to young girls in hours of grief or loneliness or in the silent watches of the night. These are of great value and designed for untold good, but are often chased away by the thoughtless gaiety of young associates. If you knew they were precious, would you retain them and let them mold your life? If you knew God was trying to win you to a life of peace, love, and holy devotion to himself, would you be so unwise, unkind, and unladylike as to silence the divine Guest? Oh, dear girls, listen!&#8212;</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Life is real, life is earnest, and the grave is not its goal;<br />Dust thou art, to dust returnest, was not spoken of the soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>A noble life! How these words should thrill us with pure and lofty aspirations, and quicken our minds and hearts to determine what for us individually would be a noble life! Would it be to be admired, to be talented, and at the top of the ladder of fame? Or would it be to have all heart could wish, and</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Like the butterfly speeding from flower to flower,<br />Culling its sweets from hour to hour&#8212;<br />Naught to distract the ear and eye<br />From singing birds and azure sky&#8221;?</p>

<p>Or would it be</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Scorning the seat of ignoble ease,<br />With constant desire and aim to please,<br />Overlooking self for others&#8217; good,<br />A blessing in the neighborhood&#8221;?</p>

<p>The purest and noblest lives are often lived in a very small corner of the world, and like the violets, shedding their sweet perfume almost unnoticed; yet the world is made sweeter, purer, and richer by their lives, the almost unperceived influence extending into other lives on and on through time and the great eternity.</p>

<p>Yes, dear girls, let the holy aspiration enter your hearts to live such noble, self-denying, and godly lives that your place may be well filled; for only in this can we meet the object for which we were created&#8212;the glory of God (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+43%3A7">Isaiah 43:7</a>).</p>

<h1>Confide in Mother</h1>

<div class="blurb">
<p class="first">&#8220;Confide in Mother&#8221; was taken from the book <i>The King&#8217;s Daughter</i>, republished by A B Publishing. I read the book and felt that other girls might benefit from the stories therein. I pray that it will be a blessing to you.</p>

<p>&#8212;Editor</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>The moment a girl hides a secret from her mother, or has received a letter she dare not let her mother read, or has a friend of whom her mother does not know, she is in danger.</p>

<p>A secret is not a good thing for a girl to have. The fewer secrets that lie in the hearts of women at any age, the better. It is almost a test of purity. She who has none of her own is best and happiest.</p>

<p>In girlhood, hide nothing from your mother; do nothing that, if discovered by your mother, would make you blush. When you are married, never conceal anything from your husband. Never allow yourself to write a letter that he may not know all about, or to receive one which you are&#8212;not quite willing that he should read.</p>

<p>Have no mysteries whatever. Tell those who are about you, where you go, and what you do&#8212;those who have the right to know, I mean, of course.</p>

<p>A little secretiveness has set many a scandal afloat; and much as is said about women who tell too much, they are a great deal better off than the woman who tells too little.</p>

<p>The girl who frankly says to her mother, &#8220;I have been there, I met so-and-so. Such and such remarks were made, and this or that was done,&#8221; will be sure to receive good advice and sympathy.</p>

<p>If all was right, no fault will be found. If the mother knows as the result of her greater experience, that something was improper or unsuitable, she will, if she is a Christian mother, kindly advise her daughter accordingly.</p>

<p>You may not always know, girls, just what is right or wrong&#8212;for you are yet young and inexperienced. You can not be blamed for making little mistakes, but you will not be likely to go very far wrong, if from the first, you have no secrets from your mother.</p>

<p class="verse">To thy father and thy mother<br />Honor, love, and reverence pay;<br />This command, before all other,<br />Must a Christian child obey.</p>

<p class="verse">Help me, Lord, in this sweet duty;<br />Guide me in Thy steps divine;<br />Show me all the joy and beauty<br />Of obedience such as Thine.</p>

<h1>A Time to Laugh</h1>

<p>One day, when I was digging carrots in the garden, Jessica, then 6, asked if she could have one. I gave her one, and she went away eating it. Later, when we were weeding together, I asked her how she liked it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, thoughtfully, &#8220;I liked the orange part.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had eaten the whole thing!</p>
