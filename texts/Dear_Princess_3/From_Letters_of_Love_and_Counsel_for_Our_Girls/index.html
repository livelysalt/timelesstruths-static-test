<p class="noindent first">From Abigail&#8217;s Mother:</p>

<p>As a young woman I heard about an old, out-of-print book entitled, <i>Letters of Love and Counsel for Our Girls</i>, by Jennie C. Rutty. I have desired to read its contents and, just recently, some dear folks loaned us a copy. Isn&#8217;t the Lord gracious! He knew my desire, and granted it just at the right time in my own girls&#8217; lives!</p>

<p>I appreciat Sister Rutty&#8217;s burden for girls. She mentioned in the introduction that she &#8220;wondered why her heart was so moved with tenderest emotions towards girls&#8212;sweetbuds of womanhood.&#8221; I believe she was called of God to write to the girls of her generation and for all who were to follow.</p>

<p>We pray these letters, penned over one hundred years ago, will be a blessing to you.</p>

<p>&#8212;Elois Spinks</p>

<h1>From <i>Letters of Love and Counsel for &#8220;Our Girls&#8221;</i></h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Girls:</p>

<p>We will have some precious seasons of thinking together upon different subjects, and our first letter will be upon a very important one that needs very careful thought. Now when you have read it, will you spend some time in bringing it before you in every wise way, and then walk in wisdom&#8217;s ways?</p>

<p>Life is one thing you all possess, and as it is counted the most precious natural gift, in this you are all equally rich. &#8220;All that a man hath will he give for his life.&#8221; Your life is given to you by our heavenly Father for a purpose. Yes, your life, whoever you may be or whatever you are, your life is given for your good and His glory. There is a way you may spend it that its influence will be for good to all with whom you associate, will be for your own present and eternal good; and, oh, such a sweet, precious thought&#8212;will be for the glory of God.</p>

<p>Many take up life carelessly and move along just like those do who surround them, and in this way form a part of the great tide of humanity who are flowing on to eternity unheeding the warnings and remonstrances of God in many of the circumstances of their lives, and by the still small voice that speaks to them in hours of quietness or sorrow or in the height of gaiety, saying, &#8220;Choose Me, for I have chosen you.&#8221;</p>

<p>It makes me think of some small object lying on the banks of the Niagara River. A little swell carries it off the shore to play along the banks, in and out of the eddies and whirls, gaining greater velocity and pushed further and further from shore, until it is carried by the mighty power of the rushing torrents of water over the great precipice.</p>

<p>Many a young life is wrecked by thoughtlessly entering upon life as others do, not meaning to do wrong but just naturally living out the life that seems the most attractive to them. The wise man does not enter upon any undertaking without careful thought and accurate calculation. If this is best in things pertaining to this life, how much more necessary where eternity is in view!
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For&#8230;&#8203;godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+4%3A8" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 4:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 4:8)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Then, dear girls, will you carefully consider this precious gift of life, and leaning not to your own understanding, ask help from God, that your lives may be wisely spent for your good and the glory of God?</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;The fear of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> is the beginning of wisdom.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+9%3A10" title="Proverbs 9:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 9:10)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Come, ye children, harken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>. What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good? Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+34%3A11-14" title="Psalm 34:11-14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 34:11-14)</span></a></span></p>

<p>As our Creator has given us minds to use, we are accountable therefore, and unthoughtfulness will not excuse us before him. This is one great fault with our young folks. So you need, dear girls, to cast it off and become earnest and thoughtful. While you each have life now, it may not be for many days, months, or years; and you may have very short time for the most important thought. As we are living and counseling you for your good, after you have read this letter do not continue in the same course of life, unless it is in every way the wisest and best.</p>

<p>There are some very earnest and weighty thoughts given to young girls in hours of grief or loneliness or in the silent watches of the night. These are of great value and designed for untold good, but are often chased away by the thoughtless gaiety of young associates. If you knew they were precious, would you retain them and let them mold your life? If you knew God was trying to win you to a life of peace, love, and holy devotion to himself, would you be so unwise, unkind, and unladylike as to silence the divine Guest? Oh, dear girls, listen!&#8212;</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Life is real, life is earnest, and the grave is not its goal;<br />Dust thou art, to dust returnest, was not spoken of the soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>A noble life! How these words should thrill us with pure and lofty aspirations, and quicken our minds and hearts to determine what for us individually would be a noble life! Would it be to be admired, to be talented, and at the top of the ladder of fame? Or would it be to have all heart could wish, and</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Like the butterfly speeding from flower to flower,<br />Culling its sweets from hour to hour&#8212;<br />Naught to distract the ear and eye<br />From singing birds and azure sky&#8221;?</p>

<p>Or would it be</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Scorning the seat of ignoble ease,<br />With constant desire and aim to please,<br />Overlooking self for others&#8217; good,<br />A blessing in the neighborhood&#8221;?</p>

<p>The purest and noblest lives are often lived in a very small corner of the world, and like the violets, shedding their sweet perfume almost unnoticed; yet the world is made sweeter, purer, and richer by their lives, the almost unperceived influence extending into other lives on and on through time and the great eternity.</p>

<p>Yes, dear girls, let the holy aspiration enter your hearts to live such noble, self-denying, and godly lives that your place may be well filled; for only in this can we meet the object for which we were created&#8212;the glory of God (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+43%3A7">Isaiah 43:7</a>).</p>
