<p>It is going to be a busy day since your family has many things to get done. Are you going to spread sunshine for Jesus or make the day cloudy by doing only what you want?</p>

<h1>The Choice is Yours</h1>

<h3><a name="1"></a>#1. At the breakfast table Dad tells you the plans. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to work on the car, and Mom is taking a trip to town,&#8221; he says.</h3>
<ul>
<li>You stay and help him. <a href="#6">Go to #6</a>.</li>

<li>You decide to go with Mom. <a href="#3">Go to #3</a>.</li>

<li>You ask to go to your friend&#8217;s house. <a href="#20">Go to #20</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="2"></a>#2. You get disciplined for arguing, as you know you should be.</h3>
<ul>
<li>You pray for help and get busy doing the work that Dad wants done. <a href="#13">Go to #13</a>.</li>

<li>You think that no one understands you and hide in the barn. <a href="#9">Go to #9</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="3"></a>#3. It takes awhile for Mom to get ready. She asks you to do the dishes while you are waiting. It is usually your sister&#8217;s job.</h3>
<ul>
<li>You slowly begin to wash them. <a href="#27">Go to #27</a>.</li>

<li>You sing while you quickly wash them. <a href="#28">Go to #28</a>.</li>

<li>You tell your sister to do them. <a href="#14">Go to #14</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="4"></a>#4. Little brother is in a bad mood, and when you try to play nicely, he bites you.</h3>
<ul>
<li>You ask Jesus to help you be kind. <a href="#21">Go to #21</a>.</li>

<li>You give him a good slap and dump him in the play pen. <a href="#8">Go to #8</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="5"></a>#5. Stopping by the shop, you check on your woodworking project first. An hour goes by before you know it.</h3>
<ul>
<li>You begin cleaning up the workshop for a surprise. <a href="#15">Go to #15</a>.</li>

<li>One of your jobs is watering the flowers, so you quickly get to work. <a href="#17">Go to #17</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="6"></a>#6. Dad asks you to get some old rags because he&#8217;s going to change the oil.</h3>
<ul>
<li>You run and grab a towel from the bathroom. <a href="#30">Go to #30</a>.</li>

<li>You ask your brother where the old rags are kept and get a couple. <a href="#12">Go to #12</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="7"></a>#7. &#8220;You&#8217;ve done so well&#8212;I was glad to have you along,&#8221; Mom says. &#8220;I think we should have a picnic at the creek this evening.&#8221; <a href="#24">Go to #24</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="8"></a>#8. Waaah! Big sister scolds you for the trouble you&#8217;re making and tells you to fold the laundry. &#8220;You can&#8217;t boss me around so I don&#8217;t have to!&#8221; you say. <a href="#2">Go to #2</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="9"></a>#9. You have forgotten about the big, nasty rooster and he attacks you. You return to the house all mucky and scratched up and the rest of the day is ruined for you. THE END</h3>
<h3><a name="10"></a>#10. The morning seems to go on forever. After three more stops and a traffic jam, you&#8217;re heading home.</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;ve had a good attitude, <a href="#7">go to #7</a>.</li>

<li>If not, <a href="#23">go to #23</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="11"></a>#11. You aren&#8217;t happy with yourself and don&#8217;t make anyone else feel happy either. You know you&#8217;ve done wrong and go to bed early with an aching head. THE END</h3>
<h3><a name="12"></a>#12. Dad pulls a paper out of his pocket and says, &#8220;Here&#8217;s a list of things that need to be done this morning.&#8221;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Glancing at the list, you stuff it in your pocket. <a href="#5">Go to #5</a>.</li>

<li>The first job is a hard one, so you slowly work on an easier one first. <a href="#17">Go to #17</a>.</li>

<li>You begin on the first job, even though you don&#8217;t like cleaning your room. <a href="#25">Go to #25</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="13"></a>#13. Dad is happy with the work that got done and thinks it&#8217;s a good time to build on the tree house. Yipee! <a href="#18">Go to #18</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="14"></a>#14. When Mom finds out she talks to you about your laziness and thoughtlessness. You are given the job of watching your little brother while the others are busy. <a href="#4">Go to #4</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="15"></a>#15. As you are putting away Dad&#8217;s tools, you decide to try out the electric drill. OUCH! You scratch up your knee and run to the house. <a href="#8">Go to #8</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="16"></a>#16. Later, Dad allows you to go fishing with your friend. There are no fish, but you have fun making a raft. <a href="#31">Go to #31</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="17"></a>#17. When you&#8217;ve done all your easy jobs, it is time for lunch. Dad says, &#8220;It makes me glad to have a helper like you to depend on.&#8221; You feel terrible&#8212;what should you say?</h3>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Glad I could help, Dad.&#8221; <a href="#11">Go to #11</a>.</li>

<li>&#8220;I am sorry, Dad, I didn&#8217;t get half my work done this morning. I&#8217;ll work hard after lunch.&#8221; <a href="#25">Go to #25</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="18"></a>#18. Just when you&#8217;ve finished hammering in the third board Mom calls Dad to come in and fix the leaky sink.</h3>
<ul>
<li>You go to the hen house to pout. <a href="#9">Go to #9</a>.</li>

<li>You decide to go along and help him. <a href="#31">Go to #31</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="19"></a>#19. You teach him to watch quietly as three deer come for a drink and a kingfisher spears a fish. It&#8217;s been a good day and everyone sings songs on the way home. THE END</h3>
<h3><a name="20"></a>#20. Dad says you will have to wait until after lunch.</h3>
<ul>
<li>You say, &#8220;Ah, Dad! We were going to go fishing, and it will be too hot later.&#8221; <a href="#2">Go to #2</a>.</li>

<li>You are disappointed, but you smile and say, &#8220;OK, I&#8217;ll be your helper today.&#8221; <a href="#6">Go to #6</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="21"></a>#21. Soon little brother calms down. When you read a story to him, he falls asleep on your lap. <a href="#16">Go to #16</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="22"></a>#22. Mom smiles at you, and you say you are sorry. At home you give her the money and pray for Jesus&#8217; help to be a cheerful worker. <a href="#16">Go to #16</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="23"></a>#23. As you begin to whine for something to eat, Mom turns to scold you and swerves off the road. BANGITY-BUMP! <a href="#29">Go to #29</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="24"></a>#24. Your family drives down to a shady pool where there are many trails to explore. Just as you are about to try out a fallen-log bridge, Dad calls you back.</h3>
<ul>
<li>You sulk about not having fun <a href="#11">Go to #11</a>.</li>

<li>You get off quickly, and help your brother climb up on some big rocks nearby <a href="#19">Go to #19</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="25"></a>#25. The work goes quicker than you thought, and you soon finish the window washing and weeding as well. <a href="#13">Go to #13</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="26"></a>#26. The next stop is the fabric store, and Mom takes a long time. Since you didn&#8217;t complain, Mom allows you to pick out some books at the library. <a href="#10">Go to #10</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="27"></a>#27. Mom is ready before you are done. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to stay and help Dad,&#8221; she says. <a href="#5">Go to #5</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="28"></a>#28. Now off to town! The first stop is the grocery store. You hope Mom will buy your favorite cereal, but she doesn&#8217;t.</h3>
<ul>
<li>You cheerfully help push the cart. <a href="#26">Go to #26</a>.</li>

<li>Grumbling, you drag along behind. <a href="#10">Go to #10</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="29"></a>#29. Now there is a big dent in the car that will cost lots of money to fix. You have been saving up in your piggy bank for something you&#8217;ve really wanted.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mom looks tired and sad, but you don&#8217;t say anything. <a href="#11">Go to #11</a>.</li>

<li>Because you made the trouble, you offer to help pay for it. <a href="#22">Go to #22</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="30"></a>#30. Dad grabs the towel and mops up a puddle of grease. Now Mom&#8217;s good towel is ruined. <a href="#14">Go to #14</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="31"></a>#31. And for a special treat after your long day, everyone gets to eat ice cream cones while listening to Mom read a favorite story. THE END</h3>
