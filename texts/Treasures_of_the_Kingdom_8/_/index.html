<h1>Right-Hand Man</h1>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_8/right_drilling.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="571" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Great job, Daniel!&#8221; Mom exclaimed from the porch. &#8220;That grass needed cutting, didn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel felt all jiggled and sore from pushing the mower so long, but it had been worth it. He grinned at Mom and said, &#8220;Just thought I&#8217;d do it since Chad&#8217;s gone.&#8221; Chad was over at Uncle Albert&#8217;s for the week, and it made Daniel feel special to be Mom&#8217;s big helper. &#8220;Need anything else done?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad hasn&#8217;t fixed the pantry door yet. Do you think you can handle it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, Mom. I know where the tools are.&#8221; He hurried to find Rosie. &#8220;I need you to hold the pantry door for me,&#8221; he said, and went to get the electric drill and Dad&#8217;s old work apron.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look like a really truly carpenter,&#8221; Rosie said as she watched him climb on the stepladder. Daniel carefully unscrewed the old hinge and thought how fun it was to be the oldest boy in the family. He could do lots more things and wasn&#8217;t told he was just a little boy all the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what I&#8217;d like best?&#8221; he told Rosie after a few minutes. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to go on the mountain biking trip with Dad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t Chad mostly go with him?&#8221; Rosie asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chad <i>always</i> goes,&#8221; Daniel said, two screws pinched between his teeth. &#8220;But I think I&#8217;m &#8217;bout big enough now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe there aren&#8217;t enough bikes,&#8221; Rosie said. &#8220;Are they going soon?&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_8/right_oiling.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="130" /></div>
<p>&#8220;In two weeks,&#8221; Daniel said, and turned on the drill. It screeched as it chewed through the wood, but he was careful to hold it steady. <i>Maybe there is a way I can go,</i> he thought to himself.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>The rest of that week Daniel kept busy. He didn&#8217;t always like the extra work he had to do, but he didn&#8217;t tell anyone. When Mom said, &#8220;I like having a &#8216;Right-hand Man&#8217; like you around,&#8221; after he had dug up her flowerbed and oiled the squeaky hinges on the gate, Daniel just smiled. He thought his plan would work if he could show them that he did things just as well as Chad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daniel&#8217;s been my &#8216;Right-hand Man&#8217; this week,&#8221; Mom said when Chad got home. Daniel felt a glad feeling in his middle.</p>

<p>&#8220;He even fixed the pantry door that was falling off,&#8221; Dad said. Daniel grinned.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_8/right_planning.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="361" /></div>
<p>But he didn&#8217;t feel like grinning a few nights later when Chad began talking about the biking trip. &#8220;It&#8217;s for three days up to Smoky Peak this time. I think my new knapsack will be perfect. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to see if Ronald can fix up his dad&#8217;s old mountain bike and come along.&#8221; Daniel stopped listening. He tried to think of something nice, but all he thought was, <i>If only, if only</i>&#8230;.</p>

<p>When Daniel woke up the next morning, he found that Chad was sick. Daniel almost felt like singing when he did his brother&#8217;s chores that morning. All day he worked hard while Chad lay in bed, sick with the flu. <i>If only Chad is sick for five more days,</i> he thought, but no, he would have to forget about it.</p>

<p>But Chad got over the flu in three days, and Daniel couldn&#8217;t forget about it. Not when he watched Chad pack up his knapsack and get out the maps. Not when he and Dad began planning out their route at the kitchen table. Daniel knew he was being unfair, but he felt grouchy. It didn&#8217;t seem to matter how he behaved anymore.</p>

<p>The day before the trip Mom took him aside. &#8220;What has happened to my &#8216;Right-hand Man&#8217;?&#8221; she asked gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem to matter how I do things,&#8221; Daniel muttered. &#8220;No one thinks I&#8217;m big enough and it just isn&#8217;t fair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s not fair?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I can&#8217;t go on the biking trip. Even though I can do things just like Chad, you only want me to work, and&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_8/right_talking.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="233" /></div>
<p>But Mom cut him short. &#8220;Daniel, is that the only reason you&#8217;ve worked so hard?&#8221; She sounded disappointed. &#8220;That&#8217;s a rather poor motive for doing it.&#8221; Daniel sat still and looked at his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; Mom said, &#8220;don&#8217;t you think you would be happier if you ask Jesus to make you a good worker for Him, instead of working to get something for yourself?&#8221; Daniel didn&#8217;t want to give up his way, but he thought about what Mom said. At last he looked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mom,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry about it, and I do want to be your helper, but it&#8217;s hard to be just &#8216;the little boy&#8217; all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Daniel,&#8221; Mom said, and gave him a squeeze, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want just &#8216;the little boy&#8217; around. I want my &#8216;Right-Hand Man,&#8217; and I know you can be one if you ask Jesus to help you.&#8221;</p>


<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_8/Motives/index.html">Motives</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Motives</h1>

<p>Your motive is <i>why</i> you do something. Jack and Jill are both going to get water, but they can be doing it for different reasons. Maybe Jill&#8217;s motive is to help her mother. Maybe Jack&#8217;s motive is to bother Jill. Which motive is the right one? Yes, Jill has a good reason to get the water, but Jack doesn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>In the story, did Daniel have a good motive? Here are some motives he could have had for working: 1) he had nothing else to do, or 2) he wanted his family to think he was a good worker so he could get something, or 3) someone told him to do it, and he had to obey, or 4) he loved his family and wanted to help them. What was Daniel&#8217;s reason for working so hard? If Daniel had asked Jesus to help him, what motive would he have had then?</p>

<p>God&#8217;s motives, or reasons for doing things, are always right. He wants the best for us, but He won&#8217;t <i>make</i> us do what is right. He tells us to choose between the good and the bad. We can obey the Bible and do what is right because our parents <i>tell</i> us to, but Jesus wants us to obey Him because we <i>love</i> Him. Love is always a good motive. True love doesn&#8217;t make us think only of what we want, but what will make others happy. True love is not afraid, because it knows that Jesus is always near. True love is the motive Jesus had when He came to the earth and died for us.</p>

<p>If Dad says for you to come, you can come because he might punish you if you don&#8217;t. That&#8217;s one motive&#8212;because you are afraid. Another motive might be a selfish one, &#8220;I wonder if Dad has something I want?&#8221; Or you could come because you love Jesus and want to do what is right. Why do you do things? It is easy to do things with the wrong reasons, and like Daniel, to only think of ourselves. When Jesus changes our hearts, it is much easier to have the right motive of love.</p>

<h1>Weeds</h1>

<p>If you have been helping in the garden this summer, you will know what I mean when I say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like weeds!&#8221; Why are they such a problem? Because they are growing where the good plants are supposed to be.</p>

<p>Weeding is a big job. To make it easier, first WATER the soil to make it softer. DIG down around the ROOTS of the weed and pull out the whole plant. If you leave part of it, the weed will grow back again. PULL weeds when they are SMALL&#8212;it always saves you from doing a lot more work later on. If they get BIG they can send out MORE weed-seeds to sprout all over your garden!</p>

<p>When you are pulling those prickly, stubborn, bad weeds&#8212;think of these weeds that need to be pulled out of your heart-soil by Jesus&#8217; help.</p>

<h1>Project, poem, and verse</h1>

<hr />
<h2>Weed Watch</h2>
<p><b>Annual sowthistle.</b> Pull or hoe these blue-green seedlings as soon as you see them, in the garden or near-by. Regular thistle should be pulled when it is a little bigger so that you can be sure to get the whole root.</p>

<p><b>Field bindweed.</b> Pull this weed right away! If it has more than 5 arrow-shaped leaves you will have to keep cutting it back every 2 weeks or cover it with black plastic.</p>

<p><b>Large crabgrass.</b> Pull or hoe every one of these grass weeds or they will spread seeds everywhere. Cover the soil with mulch (chopped leaves, straw, or grass clippings) to keep it cool and moist so the seeds can&#8217;t sprout.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Habits</h2>
<p class="verse">Bad habits grow with extra speed,
<br />Much like a healthy, growing weed.
<br />The roots grow deep, the stem grows stout;
<br />How difficult to pull it out!</p>

<p class="verse">Good habits are a little slow;
<br />They need a lot of care to grow;
<br />If tended well, they grow more fair
<br />Than any bloom a plant can bear.</p>

<p class="verse">Good habits help us all through life;
<br />Bad habits bring us pain and strife;
<br />Our habits, whether right or wrong,
<br />Each day will grow more firm and strong.</p>

<p>Alice sat on a little footstool at Grandpa&#8217;s feet as she told him about their new neighbors. &#8220;They put a big TV in their living room, and they don&#8217;t have a Bible at all,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to tell them that they should pray and obey God,&#8221; added Sammy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can think of a better way,&#8221; Grandpa said. &#8220;Listen to this story and see if you can figure it out.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Captive Maid</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Kings+5">II&nbsp;Kings 5</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">There was once a little girl, which we&#8217;ll call Sarah, that lived in the land of Israel. We don&#8217;t know if she was rich or poor, but we do know that she knew about God. In the countries all around Israel, the people didn&#8217;t worship and obey God. They prayed to idols who couldn&#8217;t hear or help them. Sarah was glad she had a real God, for hadn&#8217;t He helped David kill the giant, and brought her people from Egypt to this land long, long ago? Sarah knew about Elisha the prophet, too. She loved hearing stories of how he had prayed for the sick and they were healed.</p>

<p>But one day everything changed. A company of Syrian soldiers came raiding through her village and took Sarah captive. How frightened she was to be carried away from her family, her home, and her land. But she still had her God, and He would take care of her. She would never pray to an idol like her new master and mistress did.</p>

<p>The land of Syria was different than Israel, but Sarah soon learned what her mistress wanted and did her best to serve her. She knew God could help her, a little captive maid, to serve Him in this land of idols.</p>

<p>Now Master Naaman was the chief captain of the army and very rich, but he had a dreadful disease no one could cure called leprosy. One day Sarah said to her mistress, &#8220;I pray God, that if only my master went to prophet Elisha, he would surely be healed.&#8221; Her mistress didn&#8217;t believe in God, but Sarah hoped she would listen. She knew God could help.</p>

<p>The master heard what Sarah had said, and soon he set off to Israel with his chariot, servants, and many gifts. Sarah prayed for God&#8217;s help as she watched him go. He was going to her people and her land, but she must stay a captive maid.</p>

<p>At last Master Naaman returned home, and what things he had to tell! He had been healed of his leprosy after dipping seven times in the Jordan river. At first he didn&#8217;t want to obey the prophet&#8217;s instructions, but now he was only going to worship and obey the God of Israel. And Sarah rejoiced; by serving God in a strange land she had done her part.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The children were quiet as they thought about the story. &#8220;Well,&#8221; said Grandpa at last, &#8220;have you figured it out? What job did Sarah have?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was a maid for Master Naaman&#8217;s wife,&#8221; said Alice.</p>

<p>&#8220;And she obeyed God when other people worshipped idols,&#8221; said Edward.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Grandpa. &#8220;And Sammy, did she tell her mistress that she should obey God, too?&#8221; Sammy slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Alice. &#8220;We are suppose to just obey, ourselves, and help people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;ve figured it out,&#8221; Grandpa said. &#8220;Telling people what to do doesn&#8217;t usually help them. We must first be little &#8216;captive maids,&#8217; then maybe others will want what God&#8217;s has for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is going to be a busy day since your family has many things to get done. Are you going to spread sunshine for Jesus or make the day cloudy by doing only what you want?</p>

<h1>The Choice is Yours</h1>

<h3><a name="1"></a>#1. At the breakfast table Dad tells you the plans. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to work on the car, and Mom is taking a trip to town,&#8221; he says.</h3>
<ul>
<li>You stay and help him. <a href="#6">Go to #6</a>.</li>

<li>You decide to go with Mom. <a href="#3">Go to #3</a>.</li>

<li>You ask to go to your friend&#8217;s house. <a href="#20">Go to #20</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="2"></a>#2. You get disciplined for arguing, as you know you should be.</h3>
<ul>
<li>You pray for help and get busy doing the work that Dad wants done. <a href="#13">Go to #13</a>.</li>

<li>You think that no one understands you and hide in the barn. <a href="#9">Go to #9</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="3"></a>#3. It takes awhile for Mom to get ready. She asks you to do the dishes while you are waiting. It is usually your sister&#8217;s job.</h3>
<ul>
<li>You slowly begin to wash them. <a href="#27">Go to #27</a>.</li>

<li>You sing while you quickly wash them. <a href="#28">Go to #28</a>.</li>

<h3><a name="5"></a>#5. Stopping by the shop, you check on your woodworking project first. An hour goes by before you know it.</h3>
<ul>

<li>You ask your brother where the old rags are kept and get a couple. <a href="#12">Go to #12</a>.</li>

<h3><a name="20"></a>#20. Dad says you will have to wait until after lunch.</h3>

<h2>Something You Can Do</h2>
<p>Are you ready for another recipe? This one is very easy and delicious with most any meal. Before you begin, read all the directions and be sure that you have all the ingredients. Mom will be glad to have you help in the kitchen if you are a careful cook and clean up everything afterwards. So let&#8217;s begin:</p>

<h1>Favorite Ranch Dressing</h1>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 c. mayonaise</li>

<li>1 c. buttermilk</li>

<li>2 t. dried onion flakes</li>

<li>1/2 t. salt</li>

<li>1/8 t. garlic powder</li>

<li>1 T. dried parsley</li>

</ul>
<p>Also gather together: a 2-cup or 4-cup liquid measure, measuring spoons, whisk, and spoon.</p>

<ol>
<li>Use the spoon to scoop mayonaise into the liquid measure. Fill up to the 1-cup line.</li>

<li>Now pour in the buttermilk until it reaches the 2-cup line. Isn&#8217;t that simple? 1 cup of mayonaise + 1 cup of buttermilk = 2 cups</li>

<li>It is time to add the seasonings. Use the correct measuring spoons and add them to the mayonaise and buttermilk. If you don&#8217;t have an 1/8th teaspoon measure, just grab a pinch of the garlic powder with your fingers.</li>

<li>Use the whisk to blend everything together. If your liquid measure is a 2-cup one, be very slow and careful so that you won&#8217;t spill.</li>

<li>Serve your ranch dressing with a cheerful smile, either by pouring it from the liquid measure or by using a spoon. It is very good with salad, rice, potatoes, vegetables, tortilla chips, or casseroles. Try it with your own menu and see what you like best!</li>

<li>Store the leftovers in a covered container in the refrigerator to enjoy another day. Wash up the dishes and wipe the counter to leave the kitchen like you would want Jesus to find it.</li>

</ol>

<h1>Let Me Tell You&#8230;&#8203;</h1>

<h2 class="subtitle">how God Helped Me</h2>
<p>I have a praise that I want to share with you. I didn&#8217;t like listening to devotions, then I asked Jesus to help me. Now I can pay better attention during devotions, and can answer the questions afterwards.</p>

<p class="signature">&#8212;Age 6, WA, United States</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Don&#8217;t you like to tell things? The best things to tell are the good and true things that can help others. If Jesus has helped you, if you have learned something, if you are thankful, share it with the rest of us! Jesus wants to help us and take care of us. Take all your troubles and fears to Him, and He will always be there to listen and help you. Then you can tell how good He is to you.</p>

<h1>A Good Game</h1>

<p>&#8220;Who Am I?&#8221; is a game you might enjoy playing with your family. One person thinks of someone in the Bible to pretend to be. Everyone else tries to guess who they are. If you thought of Moses, the game might go like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Did you live before Jesus was born?&#8212;Yes.</li>

<li>Are you a man?&#8212;Yes.</li>

<li>What was something that you did?&#8212;I talked to God on a mountain.</li>

<li>Are you Elijah?&#8212;No.</li>

<li>Are you Moses?&#8212;Yes!</li>

</ul>
<p>Make whatever rules you like, but have fun!</p>

<h1>Little Corners</h1>

<p>Georgia Willis, who helped in the kitchen, was rubbing the knives. Somebody had been careless and let one get rusty, but Georgia rubbed with all her might&#8212;rubbed, and sang softly a little song:</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;In this world of darkness, we must shine,<br />You in your small corner, and I in mine.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Jesus_Bids_Us_Shine/index.html" title="Jesus Bids Us Shine">*</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you rub at the knives forever?&#8221; questioned Mary. Mary was the cook.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because they are in my corner,&#8221; Georgia said, brightly. &#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;You in your small corner,&#8217; you know, &#8216;and I in mine.&#8217; I will do the best I can; that is all I can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would not waste my strength,&#8221; said Mary. &#8220;I know that no one will notice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jesus will,&#8221; said Georgia, and then she sang again,</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;You in your small corner, and I in mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cooking the dinner is my corner, I suppose,&#8221; said Mary to herself. &#8220;If that child must do what she can, I suppose I must. If Jesus knows about knives, it is likely that He does about dinners.&#8221; And she took particular pains.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary, the dinner was very nicely cooked today,&#8221; Miss Emma said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is all due to Georgia,&#8221; said Mary, with a pleased face. Then she told about the knives.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Miss Emma was ironing ruffles; she was tired and warm. &#8220;Helen will not care whether they are fluted or not,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I will hurry them over.&#8221; But after she heard about the knives, she did her best.</p>

<p>&#8220;How beautifully my dress is done!&#8221; Helen said.</p>

<p>Emma, laughing, answered, &#8220;That is owing to Georgia.&#8221; Then she told about the knives.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Helen to her friend who urged, &#8220;I really cannot go this evening. I&#8217;m going to prayer meeting; my &#8216;corner&#8217; is there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your &#8216;corner&#8217;! What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Helen told about the knives.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; the friend said, &#8220;if you will not go with me, perhaps I will with you,&#8221; and they went to the prayer meeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;You helped us ever so much with the singing this evening,&#8221; their pastor said to them as they were going home. &#8220;I was afraid you would not be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was owing to our Georgia,&#8221; said Helen. &#8220;She seemed to think she must do what she could, if it were only to clean the knives.&#8221; Then she told him the story.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>&#8220;I believe I will go in here again,&#8221; said the minister, stopping before a poor little house. &#8220;I said yesterday there was no use; but I must do what I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the house a sick man was lying. Again and again the minister had called, but the invalid would not listen to him. Tonight the minister said, &#8220;I have come to tell you a little story.&#8221; Then he told him about Georgia Willis, about her knives, and about her &#8220;little corner,&#8221; and her &#8220;doing what she could.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sick man wiped the tears from his eyes, and said, &#8220;I will find my corner, too. I will try to shine for Jesus.&#8221; </p>

<p>And the sick man was Georgia&#8217;s father.</p>

<p>Jesus looking down at her that day said, &#8220;She hath done what she could,&#8221; and gave the blessing.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>&#8220;I believe I will not go for a walk,&#8221; said Helen, hesitatingly. &#8220;I will finish that dress of Mother&#8217;s; I suppose I can if I think so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, child, are you here sewing?&#8221; her mother said. &#8220;I thought you had gone for a walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mother; this dress seemed to be in my &#8216;corner,&#8217; so I thought I would finish it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In your &#8216;corner&#8217;!&#8221; her mother repeated in surprise. And then Helen told about the knives. The doorbell rang, and the mother went thoughtfully to receive her pastor. &#8220;I suppose I could give more,&#8221; she said to herself, as she slowly took out the ten dollars that she had laid aside for missions. &#8220;If that poor child in the kitchen is trying to do what she can, I wonder if I am. I will make it twenty-five dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>And I seem to hear Georgia&#8217;s guardian angel say to another angel, &#8220;Georgia Willis gave twenty-five dollars to our dear people in India today.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-five dollars!&#8221; said the other angel. &#8220;Why, I thought she was poor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, she thinks she is, but her Father in heaven is not, you know! She did what she could, and He did the rest.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>But Georgia knew nothing about all this, and the next morning she brightened her knives, and sang cheerily:</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;In this world of darkness, we must shine,<br />You in your small corner, and I in mine.&#8221;</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_8/Timothys_Thoughts/index.html">Timothy&#8217;s Thoughts</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Timothy&#8217;s Thoughts</h1>

<p>Timothy Kahl opened his eyes. The sun was shining in the window so brightly that he had to blink. It was not raining as it had been all week, so he would be able to play in the backyard today!</p>

<p>&#8220;Timothy,&#8221; his mother said, &#8220;I want you to watch Josh this morning. I have a lot of canning to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Timothy didn&#8217;t say anything. He did not like to take care of Josh. Josh was a lot of trouble. He was always starting to do things that he shouldn&#8217;t do. Then he would cry when Timothy wouldn&#8217;t let him do them. Timothy almost wished that it were raining again. Then maybe he wouldn&#8217;t have to take care of Josh.</p>

<p>Slowly Timothy followed Josh out to the swing set. Josh pulled on the chains of the swing. He wanted Timothy to lift him up. Josh was heavy! Finally Timothy got him in the swing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Push,&#8221; said Josh.</p>

<p>Timothy sighed. He pushed Josh a little bit.</p>

<p>&#8220;More,&#8221; said Josh.</p>

<p>Then a thought came to Timothy. If he pushed Josh very hard, Josh might get scared. He would cry. He would want to go to Mother. And Timothy could play by himself!</p>

<p>Then another thought came to Timothy. He remembered how he had prayed to Jesus, asking Him to forgive him for being mean to his little brother. He remembered how mean he used to be to Josh about his broken airplane. Jesus had forgiven Timothy, and he had prayed that he would always be good.</p>

<p><i>I want to be good for Jesus,</i> thought Timothy. So he carefully pushed Josh just a little harder.</p>

<p>The swing went forward, and Josh laughed with enjoyment. Then the swing came back and CRASH! Timothy was lying flat on his back! Josh had fallen on him and was crying loudly. Timothy felt like crying, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; Mother was saying. &#8220;Are you all right?&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_8/timothy_bandage.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="358" /></div>
<p>Timothy&#8217;s back hurt. A place above his eye was bleeding where a chain from the swing had hit him. But Josh was hugging him. &#8220;All right?&#8221; Josh was saying. &#8220;Tim-ee, all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>In his heart Timothy felt good, really good. He was all right. He smiled at Mommy who was looking at him carefully. As Mother washed and put a band-aid on the cut above his eye, he told her about the thought that had told him to push Josh very hard. He was so glad, so very glad that he had not.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was the devil, Timothy,&#8221; Mother said. &#8220;The devil comes and tells us to do bad things. But the Lord comes and tells us to do the right thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil talked to me by the swing set?&#8221; exclaimed Timothy. His eyes were big.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and the Lord talked to you as well,&#8221; Mother replied.</p>

<p>Timothy was so glad that he had listened to the Lord, and not to the devil.</p>
