<p>Alice sat on a little footstool at Grandpa&#8217;s feet as she told him about their new neighbors. &#8220;They put a big TV in their living room, and they don&#8217;t have a Bible at all,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to tell them that they should pray and obey God,&#8221; added Sammy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can think of a better way,&#8221; Grandpa said. &#8220;Listen to this story and see if you can figure it out.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Captive Maid</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Kings+5">II&nbsp;Kings 5</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">There was once a little girl, which we&#8217;ll call Sarah, that lived in the land of Israel. We don&#8217;t know if she was rich or poor, but we do know that she knew about God. In the countries all around Israel, the people didn&#8217;t worship and obey God. They prayed to idols who couldn&#8217;t hear or help them. Sarah was glad she had a real God, for hadn&#8217;t He helped David kill the giant, and brought her people from Egypt to this land long, long ago? Sarah knew about Elisha the prophet, too. She loved hearing stories of how he had prayed for the sick and they were healed.</p>

<p>But one day everything changed. A company of Syrian soldiers came raiding through her village and took Sarah captive. How frightened she was to be carried away from her family, her home, and her land. But she still had her God, and He would take care of her. She would never pray to an idol like her new master and mistress did.</p>

<p>The land of Syria was different than Israel, but Sarah soon learned what her mistress wanted and did her best to serve her. She knew God could help her, a little captive maid, to serve Him in this land of idols.</p>

<p>Now Master Naaman was the chief captain of the army and very rich, but he had a dreadful disease no one could cure called leprosy. One day Sarah said to her mistress, &#8220;I pray God, that if only my master went to prophet Elisha, he would surely be healed.&#8221; Her mistress didn&#8217;t believe in God, but Sarah hoped she would listen. She knew God could help.</p>

<p>The master heard what Sarah had said, and soon he set off to Israel with his chariot, servants, and many gifts. Sarah prayed for God&#8217;s help as she watched him go. He was going to her people and her land, but she must stay a captive maid.</p>

<p>At last Master Naaman returned home, and what things he had to tell! He had been healed of his leprosy after dipping seven times in the Jordan river. At first he didn&#8217;t want to obey the prophet&#8217;s instructions, but now he was only going to worship and obey the God of Israel. And Sarah rejoiced; by serving God in a strange land she had done her part.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The children were quiet as they thought about the story. &#8220;Well,&#8221; said Grandpa at last, &#8220;have you figured it out? What job did Sarah have?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was a maid for Master Naaman&#8217;s wife,&#8221; said Alice.</p>

<p>&#8220;And she obeyed God when other people worshipped idols,&#8221; said Edward.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Grandpa. &#8220;And Sammy, did she tell her mistress that she should obey God, too?&#8221; Sammy slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Alice. &#8220;We are suppose to just obey, ourselves, and help people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;ve figured it out,&#8221; Grandpa said. &#8220;Telling people what to do doesn&#8217;t usually help them. We must first be little &#8216;captive maids,&#8217; then maybe others will want what God&#8217;s has for them.&#8221;</p>
