<h1>Little Corners</h1>

<p>Georgia Willis, who helped in the kitchen, was rubbing the knives. Somebody had been careless and let one get rusty, but Georgia rubbed with all her might&#8212;rubbed, and sang softly a little song:</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;In this world of darkness, we must shine,<br />You in your small corner, and I in mine.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Jesus_Bids_Us_Shine/index.html" title="Jesus Bids Us Shine">*</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you rub at the knives forever?&#8221; questioned Mary. Mary was the cook.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because they are in my corner,&#8221; Georgia said, brightly. &#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;You in your small corner,&#8217; you know, &#8216;and I in mine.&#8217; I will do the best I can; that is all I can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would not waste my strength,&#8221; said Mary. &#8220;I know that no one will notice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jesus will,&#8221; said Georgia, and then she sang again,</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;You in your small corner, and I in mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cooking the dinner is my corner, I suppose,&#8221; said Mary to herself. &#8220;If that child must do what she can, I suppose I must. If Jesus knows about knives, it is likely that He does about dinners.&#8221; And she took particular pains.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary, the dinner was very nicely cooked today,&#8221; Miss Emma said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is all due to Georgia,&#8221; said Mary, with a pleased face. Then she told about the knives.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Miss Emma was ironing ruffles; she was tired and warm. &#8220;Helen will not care whether they are fluted or not,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I will hurry them over.&#8221; But after she heard about the knives, she did her best.</p>

<p>&#8220;How beautifully my dress is done!&#8221; Helen said.</p>

<p>Emma, laughing, answered, &#8220;That is owing to Georgia.&#8221; Then she told about the knives.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Helen to her friend who urged, &#8220;I really cannot go this evening. I&#8217;m going to prayer meeting; my &#8216;corner&#8217; is there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your &#8216;corner&#8217;! What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Helen told about the knives.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; the friend said, &#8220;if you will not go with me, perhaps I will with you,&#8221; and they went to the prayer meeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;You helped us ever so much with the singing this evening,&#8221; their pastor said to them as they were going home. &#8220;I was afraid you would not be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was owing to our Georgia,&#8221; said Helen. &#8220;She seemed to think she must do what she could, if it were only to clean the knives.&#8221; Then she told him the story.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>&#8220;I believe I will go in here again,&#8221; said the minister, stopping before a poor little house. &#8220;I said yesterday there was no use; but I must do what I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the house a sick man was lying. Again and again the minister had called, but the invalid would not listen to him. Tonight the minister said, &#8220;I have come to tell you a little story.&#8221; Then he told him about Georgia Willis, about her knives, and about her &#8220;little corner,&#8221; and her &#8220;doing what she could.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sick man wiped the tears from his eyes, and said, &#8220;I will find my corner, too. I will try to shine for Jesus.&#8221; </p>

<p>And the sick man was Georgia&#8217;s father.</p>

<p>Jesus looking down at her that day said, &#8220;She hath done what she could,&#8221; and gave the blessing.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>&#8220;I believe I will not go for a walk,&#8221; said Helen, hesitatingly. &#8220;I will finish that dress of Mother&#8217;s; I suppose I can if I think so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, child, are you here sewing?&#8221; her mother said. &#8220;I thought you had gone for a walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mother; this dress seemed to be in my &#8216;corner,&#8217; so I thought I would finish it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In your &#8216;corner&#8217;!&#8221; her mother repeated in surprise. And then Helen told about the knives. The doorbell rang, and the mother went thoughtfully to receive her pastor. &#8220;I suppose I could give more,&#8221; she said to herself, as she slowly took out the ten dollars that she had laid aside for missions. &#8220;If that poor child in the kitchen is trying to do what she can, I wonder if I am. I will make it twenty-five dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>And I seem to hear Georgia&#8217;s guardian angel say to another angel, &#8220;Georgia Willis gave twenty-five dollars to our dear people in India today.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-five dollars!&#8221; said the other angel. &#8220;Why, I thought she was poor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, she thinks she is, but her Father in heaven is not, you know! She did what she could, and He did the rest.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>But Georgia knew nothing about all this, and the next morning she brightened her knives, and sang cheerily:</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;In this world of darkness, we must shine,<br />You in your small corner, and I in mine.&#8221;</p>
