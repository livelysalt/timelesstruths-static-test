<h1>Dear Reader</h1>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A28" title="Romans 8:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 8:28)</span></a></span></p>

<p>There are countless ways in which this scripture is fulfilled every day, and the closer you draw near to God, the more you see them. I want to illustrate with just one recent instance in my life.</p>

<p>I have been seeking the Lord for direction concerning a business venture I got into a couple of years ago that has not financially prospered. It would take too long to give adequate background to understand some of the ins and outs of it, but suffice here to say that there have been times of spiritual blessing and a lot of refining for my soul involved in this &#8220;venture.&#8221; I felt that I needed to know the next step&#8212;quit, go on, reduce the scale somewhat, change the focus, etc. I had not been getting any answers I had confidence were coming from the Lord.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was working around the house, completing some outdoor projects and helping with some interior &#8220;rearranging&#8221; (taking down some cupboards to put in a different room), and it was early afternoon. I wanted to spend some time praying for this issue of <i>Foundation Truth</i>, and asked my son about a writing that he had mentioned might be profitable for this issue. He referred me to it, and I read the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">God wants the worker more than the work. He wants our love more than our labor, our hearts rather than our hands. His kingdom is advanced far more by what we are than by what we do. We may do ever so much, but if our doing is not the outflowing of the cheering, joyous, hopeful life of Christ at the center of the heart, our work will be destructive instead of constructive.</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[Orr, Charles E.; <a href="../../../texts/The_More_Abundant_Life/index.html"><i>The More Abundant Life</i></a>, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/The_More_Abundant_Life/The_More_Abundant_Life/index.html">The More Abundant Life</a>&#8221;]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>I was impressed that I needed to draw near to the Lord to express my love and be replenished by Him right then, rather than attempt to figure out the next task. I spent some time and was rewarded by a strong sense of the Lord&#8217;s pleasure. Then, my business phone rang.</p>

<p>You perhaps would do well to know two more things at this point. First, I had asked the Lord to indicate some direction by some business prior to the end of the month, and this was my last &#8220;working&#8221; day of the month for my business venture. Second, although my business phone rings on average several times a day, it is usually faxes or someone selling something to businesses&#8212;it had been awhile since a potential client called. This call was a potential client, but though it turned out that I was not in a position to help him directly, I was able to give him some tangible direction towards the help he needed. I was ministering to him as best as I could, and was very much blessed in my soul. I concluded the Lord was speaking to me, but I wanted confirmation and further direction.</p>

<p>In meeting today, in two separate messages (one on &#8220;Touching Jesus&#8221; and the other on &#8220;The Unleavened Bread of the Gospel&#8221;), the Lord reaffirmed that He intended for this &#8220;business venture&#8221; to be conducted as a service and ministry, without a concern about providing for my family (He has graciously been providing for us by a different line of work).</p>

<p>I trust that some of you are rejoicing in the Lord on the basis of what I&#8217;ve shared, but I also recognize that it is difficult to capture in a few words the depth in which this touched me at this particular time&#8212;surely God is Love!</p>

<p>Our prayer is that you will find in this issue some of those <span class="scripture">&#8220;all things&#8221;</span> that <span class="scripture">&#8220;work together for good&#8221;</span>!</p>

<h1>Able to Keep You from Falling</h1>

<p>Some dear friends of ours believe that it is exceedingly wicked to believe or to testify that men can live sinless lives down here in this world by the grace of God. They believe that man is too weak and too lacking in understanding to please God. They believe that the commandments of the Word of God on this point are not really possible, and that the Bible&#8217;s teachings on this subject are simply noble goals&#8212;out of reach, but uplifting and inspirational.</p>

<p>Now, if it were simply up to us to achieve and sustain the standard of the Word of God; why&#8212;we would agree with our friends; <i>for it is manifestly impossible to live to the Bible standard of holiness and purity without the help of God, both in the radical change of the human heart and in the keeping of that regenerated heart.</i> Men cannot live for God and please Him without His constant assistance any more than Peter was able to walk on the water without the assistance of the Savior.</p>

<p>In Titus 2:11, we read that <span class="scripture">&#8220;the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+2%3A11" title="Titus 2:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Titus 2:11)</span></a></span> We note that the word translated <i>should</i>, is more properly rendered, <i>may</i>. That is, it is our <i>privilege</i>. Accordingly, we find in the Word of God that,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+1%3A3-4" title="II&nbsp;Peter 1:3-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 1:3-4)</span></a></span>
We see here that God has <span class="scripture">&#8220;given unto us <b>all things</b> that pertain unto life and godliness,&#8221;</span> and that the effect of these Divine provisions is to have brought about an escape from sin while we are yet in a world of evil. Furthermore, a saved man is changed from being by nature the child of wrath into a partaker of the divine nature. What a wonderful salvation God hath wrought! It brings an end of the sinning business in a person&#8217;s life (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Daniel+9%3A24">Daniel 9:24</a>). It translates the sinner from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of the Son of God, making the sinner an ex-sinner in the process (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+1%3A13">Colossians 1:13</a>). The <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossions+1%3A14">fourteenth verse</a> informs us that this happens when our sins are forgiven.</p>

<p>Now sin is the thing that separates between us and God (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+59%3A2">Isaiah 59:2</a>). It brings death to the inner man, i.e., separation between God and the soul (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+2%3A17%3B+Ephesians+2%3A1%3B+1+Timothy+5%3A6">Genesis 2:17; Ephesians 2:1; I&nbsp;Timothy 5:6</a>). Salvation is a resurrection, a quickening to life. It produces a new creature, a new man (or woman). The change is profound (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+5%3A17%3B+Galatians+6%3A15">II&nbsp;Corinthians 5:17; Galatians 6:15</a>).</p>

<p>It is important here to realize that <i>the sin that separates from God</i> involves willful disobedience&#8212;there is an element of <i>rebellion</i> in the doing or not doing of what we comprehend. The rebellion (or lack thereof) is in the motive, and this is what God regards. For
<span class="scripture">&#8220;<b>sin is not imputed when there is no law.</b>&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+5%3A13" title="Romans 5:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 5:13)</span></a></span>
God will judge everyone according to their light and understanding and what they have done with it. Note how this works even in those who have no understanding of the Bible:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;) in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+2%3A14-16" title="Romans 2:14-16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 2:14-16)</span></a></span>
We see that people who may seem to have little or no understanding still yet have a law written in their hearts, of which their conscience bears witness and accuses or excuses their actions. This bears out the thought that we are judged in terms of the understanding we have, and whether we have kept what we knew to be right or not.</p>

<p>Early in our lives, we are unconscious of our own motives enough that God does not impute sin to us. We do not know what we doing. We properly term this state of mind and heart a state of innocence. Very little children and babies do things that are wrong, but it is not imputed to them, as they are unaware that they are violating a moral law. They are innocent, and this innocence is a beautiful thing to see. In every one of us, except Jesus, this innocence was lost when we came to an age of accountability. At that point, we continued to act out what was in our hearts, but we became aware that what we were doing was wrong; and we lost our innocence and became guilty before God. It was not only that we continued to do wrong things and could not desist from sin, but we also realized that we have been wrong all along, and now we were accountable to God. How precious to hear the Good News at that point! The Son of Man is come to seek and save that which is lost. Here begins the striving of the Spirit of God to turn each of us from the way of destruction to the way of salvation. It continues until we yield and find God&#8217;s great salvation, or until it is too late.</p>

<p>Now to find God&#8217;s great salvation is to find this childhood innocence all over again with this one great difference: now I am no longer oblivious to the law under which I live.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, and said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and <b>become as little children</b>, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+18%3A2-3" title="Matthew 18:2-3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 18:2-3)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; cry some our friends, &#8220;that is just it! We are just little children. We know not how to come in or go out. We cannot <i>stay</i> clean, any more than children can. In our flesh dwelleth no good thing (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+7%3A18">Romans 7:18</a>). God has great mercy on us, but you cannot contend that He expects more of us than we are capable of doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>We would certainly agree that God expects reasonable service&#8212;not unreasonable service. But we would also quote you from the words of Jesus,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+19%3A26" title="Matthew 19:26"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 19:26)</span></a></span>
We would also like to ask you to stop a moment and pray (if you are skeptical) that God will help you to get a glimpse of what <i>He</i> has prepared for the human race as they live in this present world. We are aware that you will not see it if God does not help you. You need more than our words, or even the words of the Bible. You need <span class="scripture">&#8220;flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+16%3A17" title="Matthew 16:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 16:17)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Let me quote you this scripture,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jude+1%3A24" title="Jude 1:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jude 1:24)</span></a></span>
Do you believe this? Do you really believe that God is able to <i>keep you from falling</i> and to present you <i>faultless</i>?</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes,&#8221; you say. &#8220;I know God can do anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>When does He start the process? Before God can keep you from falling, He must lift you above your sins, mustn&#8217;t He? Is He really <i>able</i> to do that and to sustain you afterwards?
<span class="scripture">&#8220;If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1%3A9" title="I&nbsp;John 1:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 1:9)</span></a></span>
After the event here related&#8212;the confession, forgiveness, and cleansing of our sins, God does what? He cleanses us from <i>all unrighteousness</i>? How much unrighteousness is left at that point?</p>

<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; you may say. &#8220;When God forgives and cleanses us, all sin is gone. But you can&#8217;t stay like that. The world is too wicked.&#8221; We will answer you with the Word of God:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+4%3A4" title="I&nbsp;John 4:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 4:4)</span></a></span>
This scripture is unmistakable. It teaches that God&#8217;s children are of Him (partakers of the Divine nature), and that they are <i>overcomers</i>. They are overcomers because He within is <i>greater</i> than he that is in the world. Read also <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+3%3A5-10">I&nbsp;John 3:5-10</a>.</p>

<p>Now, if you have more faith in the weakness of man than the power of God, and feel that it is more appropriate and even glorifying to God for men to fail continually, more or less (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+6%3A1-2">Romans 6:1-2</a>), what will you do with the clear and unmistakable message of these scriptures? After God has cleaned up a man or woman and changed their heart, can He keep them without sin for one minute? Two minutes? An half hour? An hour? A day? A week? A month? A year? Five years? All the rest of their lives?</p>

<p>Jesus has a salvation that saves to the uttermost. It will produce an individual experience that will measure to <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A27">Ephesians 5:27</a>&#8212;a regenerated and sanctified heart that will be wrinkle-free, spot-free, and glorious. And He will direct and guide the soul, sustaining it, winnowing the path, shielding and succoring it in time of temptation.</p>

<p>Dear and precious saints of the Old Testament <i>did not</i> possess this salvation, for it was not available to them.

<h1>As He Is So Are We in This World</h1>

<p>By nearly all sin-serving professors it is admitted that the Bible requires us to be pure and holy, and to live free from sin. But most of them claim that we cannot in this life meet those requirements. That the commands, <span class="scripture">&#8220;be ye holy,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+1%3A16" title="I&nbsp;Peter 1:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 1:16)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;be ye&#8230;&#8203;perfect,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+5%3A48" title="Matthew 5:48"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 5:48)</span></a></span> etc., are simply set before us as the standard toward which we should ever approach, but cannot, while living in this world, hope to attain. For instance, before us is a letter from a man who subscribes his name, Stixtus, from Brookville, PA, in which he seeks to cloak over his sins. He speaks against what he calls our &#8220;ridiculous attempt to bolster up that old and long since exploded doctrine of perfect sanctification in this life.&#8221; On the next page appear these words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">All admit that perfect sanctification ought to be, and in fact is the aim of every child of God in every stage of his progress here on earth. It is also certainly true that God requires all capable and responsible men everywhere to be holy as He is holy, and perfect as He is perfect. No one denies this, or in fact ever did deny it. The real question is simply this: Are true believers all they ought to be? Are they as holy, as perfect, as sinless, as they ought to be, and as God requires them to be? The true church universal answers emphatically in the negative. The reply of your dupes is an emphatic yes. Thus you, in effect, say we are as holy, as perfect, as sinless, and immaculate as we ought to be, or in fact can be. From this it follows that those who claim to be perfectly sanctified in this life will not be, and do not expect to be any more holy, sinless, or spotless, when singing the song of redeeming love in heaven, than they are here on earth.</p>

<p>The apostle says, speaking of true believers after death, &#8220;We shall be like him [Christ], for we shall see him as he is.&#8221; But those who believe in perfect sanctification in this life, as represented by you, believe themselves now to be as pure, as holy, and as sinless, as the Lord Jesus Christ. Permit me to say that such a belief is simply disgusting to any one who realizes that the human heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked. It is worse than disgusting; it is blasphemy.</p>

<p>Let us notice some of the leading passages of scripture you rely on to give authority to your belief. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Be ye holy; for I am holy.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+1%3A16" title="I&nbsp;Peter 1:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 1:16)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+5%3A48" title="Matthew 5:48"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 5:48)</span></a></span> These commandments you seem to think prove that the true believer is holy in this life. This simply proves your lamentable ignorance of the scriptures. These commandments declare what the true believer ought to be and must be, not what he really is, your arrogant gabble to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>How does this last sentence sound from a man who accuses us with being &#8220;scurrilous to the extreme in most, if not all, our articles&#8221;? Nay, Mr. Stixtus, we have no time nor inclination to condescend to such words. <span class="scripture">&#8220;For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+10%3A4" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 10:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 10:4)</span></a></span> We have no need of anything stronger than the truth, nor sharper than the Word of God. This disputer of the power of God to fulfill in us His Word, and make us what we ought to be, is a fair sample of Babylon confusion in general. He calls the doctrine of &#8220;perfect sanctification in this life&#8221; &#8220;old and long exploded.&#8221; And yet admits that it is just what God requires of all men everywhere. So the man seems to think that the requirement of God is long since exploded, i.e., proved a fallacy. But, says he, &#8220;The real question is simply this: Are true believers all they ought to be? Are they as holy, as perfect, as sinless as they ought to be, as God requires them to be?&#8221; That is always the way with hirelings. &#8220;The real question&#8221; with them is not what God requires, and what men &#8220;ought to be&#8221;; but what they are, and what will please them? He would have us drop the standard of the divine requirement, because the masses of sectism are far below it. How forcibly the words of the apostle apply here.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+1%3A10" title="Galatians 1:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 1:10)</span></a></span>
There is a variance between God and the people. He requires them to be holy, perfect and spotless in His sight. But they are far from this. So if they become one with God, He will have to come to them, or they to Him. He must either recall His commandments, or the people measure to them. What shall we, as God&#8217;s ambassadors, do in the case? &#8220;Do we persuade men or God?&#8221; Persuade Him to modify His Word, or the people to change their ways? <span class="scripture">&#8220;Or do I seek to please men?&#8221;</span> God forbid; <span class="scripture">&#8220;for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>This man-pleasing and God-dishonoring policy is all foretold in prophecy.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+30%3A10" title="Isaiah 30:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 30:10)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land; the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+5%3A29-31" title="Jeremiah 5:29-31"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jeremiah 5:29-31)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>The position taken by Stixtus is virtually this: God requires all capable and responsible men everywhere to be holy as He is holy, etc. But all men everywhere&#8212;down in Babylon where he lives&#8212;are unholy and imperfect. Therefore, what God requires is &#8220;old and exploded.&#8221; Well, if we accept the standard of Babylon, God&#8217;s Word is exploded and fallen; but, on the other hand, if we accept the Bible standard, behold, Babylon is exploded and fallen. Which is true? A voice from heaven answers,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+18%3A2" title="Revelation 18:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 18:2)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>But we might apply the above logic with equal propriety to repentance and a hundred other demands of God that the people come short of. It is certainly true that God requires all capable and responsible men everywhere to repent of their sins. But the real question is simply this: Have the world of sinners and professors repented as they should? By no means. Therefore the doctrine of genuine repentance in this life is an &#8220;old and long since exploded&#8221; thing. And all who teach it are &#8220;lamentably ignorant,&#8221; and all who believe their teaching, &#8220;dupes.&#8221; The reasoning is the same; and if it has any weight against perfect sanctification, it weighs equally against repentance and justification. But of course it is ridiculous falsehood, blind confusion. According to this Stixtus, a &#8220;true believer&#8221; is one that does not believe the truth, is &#8220;not what he ought to be, nor what God requires him to be.&#8221; But a man that really believes the Word of God, and lives and testifies accordingly is pronounced &#8220;lamentably ignorant,&#8221; &#8220;disgusting,&#8221; &#8220;blasphemer.&#8221;</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+5%3A20-21" title="Isaiah 5:20-21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 5:20-21)</span></a></span></p>

<p>After quoting, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Be ye holy; for I am holy,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+1%3A16" title="I&nbsp;Peter 1:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 1:16)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+5%3A48" title="Matthew 5:48"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 5:48)</span></a></span> &#8220;Darkness-for-light&#8221; says: &#8220;These commandments you seem to think prove that the true believer is holy in this life. This simply proves your lamentable ignorance of the scriptures. These commandments declare what the true believer ought to be and must be, not what he really is.&#8221;</p>

<p>We confess that we are very ignorant indeed of all scriptures which teach that a true believer is yet an unholy man. That he is not what he &#8220;ought to be,&#8221; nor what he &#8220;must be.&#8221; Our knowledge of the Bible is so limited that we have not learned how a man can serve two masters; can be a Christian and a sinner at the same time. We have never yet learned in that sacred volume that a &#8220;good tree can bring forth evil fruit, or an evil tree good fruit.&#8221; Nor have we attained that modern wisdom which maintains that a true believer is one who does not believe the Word of God, and he that does believe and teach the same is a blasphemer.</p>

<p>Our friend Stixtus is greatly shocked by the testimony of God&#8217;s children that the blood of Christ has made us &#8220;as holy, as perfect, as sinless as we ought to be.&#8221; Will he please prove by the Word that it is consistent, and to the glory of God to be anything else? Remember that all we contend for in the provisions of divine grace he admits we ought to be, and must be, and God requires it of us. There is no question of this. But the real question with him is, &#8220;Are we all we ought to be?&#8221; A very questionable thing in Babylon. But this has nothing to do with the Word of God, nor yet with those who have come out of her and are <span class="scripture">&#8220;complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+2%3A10" title="Colossians 2:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 2:10)</span></a></span> God pity the dwellers in the dark city of confusion. Like the disciples of Christ who became offended at the words of Christ. The very thing they admit God requires of all His children they pronounce a &#8220;hard saying&#8221;: &#8220;Thus you in effect say, we are as holy, as perfect, as sinless, as we ought to be, or in fact can be,&#8221; and &#8220;do not expect to be any more holy, sinless, or spotless, when singing the song of redeeming love in heaven than you are here on earth.&#8221; To all of which we answer: Why not? Read the preceding chapters, and answer before the Almighty, Where is there a cloak to cover your sins? What man is fool enough to think he can stand before the judgment bar of God and say, &#8220;Lord, we knew You required all capable and responsible men everywhere to be holy as You are holy, and perfect as You are perfect. No one denies this, but we confess we are not as holy, as perfect, as sinless as we ought to be, and as God requires us to be. But this is our plea: We could not be what You demanded of us.&#8221; Will you thus stand before the bar of God and make Him a liar who says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;My grace is sufficient for thee&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+12%3A9" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 12:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 12:9)</span></a></span>? And in a thousand other promises which leave absolutely nothing wanting to perfect in holiness and preserve blameless in soul and body, in heart and life, all who are willing and obedient? Will you say to the Judge, &#8220;Our preachers told us we could not be pure and perfect while living in the flesh?&#8221; Then shall the Judge say, &#8220;I never sent them&#8221; (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+23%3A21-22">Jeremiah 23:21-22</a>).
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+3%3A34" title="John 3:34"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 3:34)</span></a></span>

</p>

<p>Again we ask: Why not be pure and holy and sinless in this life? Was not Christ <span class="scripture">&#8220;manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+3%3A5" title="I&nbsp;John 3:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 3:5)</span></a></span>? Is it not true that <span class="scripture">&#8220;the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1%3A7" title="I&nbsp;John 1:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 1:7)</span></a></span>?

Is not the power of God sufficient to do all this for us?</p>

<p>Thus answers Stixtus: &#8220;The apostle says, speaking of true believers after death, &#8216;We shall be like him [Christ], for we shall see him as he is.&#8217; This is a perversion of the Word of God, a quiet, soothing deception of the devil. The reference is to <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+3%3A2-3">I&nbsp;John 3:2-3</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.&#8221;</span> While this includes saints of God whose bodies have fallen asleep, it does not refer to a condition that was produced by death, nor is it confined to the departed; but equally refers to the faithful who will be living at the instant of Christ&#8217;s coming. &#8220;We shall see Him as He is,&#8221; in the morning of His glorious coming, and shall be found like Him. We know that a change will take place then which will fashion our mortal bodies like unto His glorious body. That will be the resurrection. But that change is not alluded to in the above words. Else would the apostle have said, &#8220;When He comes we shall be made like Him.&#8221; But he refers to the moral condition into which the grace of God has transformed us. The &#8220;Image&#8221; of our Creator (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+3%3A10">Colossians 3:10</a>), which is perfect holiness. This is positively proved in the next verse.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;We shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himselfw even as he [Christ), is pure.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+3%3A2-3" title="I&nbsp;John 3:2-3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 3:2-3)</span></a></span>
Whoever expects to be like Christ, must attain that condition before His coming; must purify himself even as Christ is pure. Then, of course, he will be like Him when He appears. The third verse explains the second. To be like Christ is to be sanctified wholly, <span class="scripture">&#8220;pure in heart&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+5%3A8" title="Matthew 5:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 5:8)</span></a></span>; for such the Savior said shall see Him. The same state is again referred to: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+4%3A17" title="I&nbsp;John 4:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 4:17)</span></a></span></p>

<p>This does not defer the likeness of Christ in our soul until the next world. It does not speak of a state after death. But our love being made perfect we are already like Him. This state is not produced by death, but love made perfect is the result of heart purity. A heart so perfectly cleansed by the blood of Christ that nothing remains but the love of God shed abroad by the Holy Spirit. Perfect purity and perfect love are co-relative, and inclusive of each other. So the only text cited to prove that we will not be like Christ until after death, with its context proves that we are like Him in this life. <span class="scripture">&#8220;As he is, so are we in this world.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+4%3A17" title="I&nbsp;John 4:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 4:17)</span></a></span> Reader, are you now, in this world, like Christ in moral purity as He sits at the right hand of the throne of God? If not, your hope to stand in the day of judgment will prove a fatal delusion.</p>

<p>Observe that the opposer of Bible sanctification in this life, freely admits that we ought to be holy and sinless in this life. Even said we &#8220;must be.&#8221; Now these terms very positively enjoin moral obligation. If we ought to be holy, we are morally bound to be such. No doubt in other things he has told people that they could not enter heaven if they leave undone commands of Christ they ought to do. How, then, can he expect to stand in the day of judgment, if not what he ought to be in perfect holiness, and what God requires him to be? If a person can set aside God&#8217;s law and solemn command, &#8220;Be ye holy,&#8221; what part of the Bible is binding? Be not deceived, the Word of God is forever settled in heaven, and will judge us in the last day. Then <span class="scripture">&#8220;Be ye holy&#8221;</span> will speak in thunder tones to all the unholy; will strike terror to their souls, and drive them back from the presence of God and the glory of His power. If not pure as Christ in this life, some sin remains in you. Death will not remove sin. Therefore if you die in that condition, the judgment day will find you the same, and drive you from the presence of God.</p>

<p>But here is the key to Mr. Stixtus&#8217; unbelief: &#8220;Permit me to say that such a belief, i.e., that of being pure, holy and sinless as Christ in this life&#8212;such a belief is simply disgusting to any one who realizes that the human heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alas! Here it all comes out what kind of a heart is back of this wretched unbelief in perfect sanctification. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+1%3A15" title="Titus 1:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Titus 1:15)</span></a></span> No wonder the man is so extremely disgusted with the idea of heart purity in this life: for <span class="scripture">&#8220;it is abomination to fools to depart from evil.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+13%3A19" title="Proverbs 13:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 13:19)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Now we do not call in question the statement of the prophet that <span class="scripture">&#8220;The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+17%3A9" title="Jeremiah 17:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jeremiah 17:9)</span></a></span> But who is so blind as not to see that this refers to the human heart in its natural depraved state? Surely Jesus had reference to a very different heart in the beatitude, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+5%3A8" title="Matthew 5:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 5:8)</span></a></span> The application of the description given by Jeremiah to Christians, and all indiscriminately, sadly betrays ignorance of the work of heart cleansing in the blood of Christ. Yea, his words clearly imply that such is his own heart. Surely great darkness reigns in Babylon, else her teachers would know better than to use the deceitful and wicked hearts of sinners as a standard for Christians, and hope thereby to cloak over their sins. Surely if Hezekiah had been in possession of a heart that was &#8220;desperately wicked,&#8221; he could not have testified in the face of God that he had <span class="scripture">&#8220;walked before [him] in truth and with a perfect heart.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Kings+20%3A3" title="II&nbsp;Kings 20:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Kings 20:3)</span></a></span> If such were the case of Christian hearts, we would like to know what Christ has done for us? What virtue is there in His blood? What benefit in His salvation? Then what did Paul mean when he wrote Timothy to <span class="scripture">&#8220;follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A22" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 2:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 2:22)</span></a></span>? Oh, when will men cease to drag the Word of God and their obligations down on a level with their deceitful hearts and unholy lives, rather than measure their responsibilities by the Word of God, and then appropriate His almighty grace to lift them up to its holy standard? One minute&#8217;s reflection with common sense upon the theme must lead every candid mind to the conclusion that, since salvation is of God, and is no more limited than the Infinite Himself, no person needs to fall short of what he ought to be, what he must be, and what God requires him to be. Who dare for a moment deny that the Almighty is able to remove all sin out of our entire being, restore our soul to the same holy image in which He created man; <span class="scripture">&#8220;bruise Satan under [our] feet,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+16%3A20" title="Romans 16:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 16:20)</span></a></span> and give us power over all the power of the adversary; <span class="scripture">&#8220;make a way to escape&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+10%3A13" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 10:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 10:13)</span></a></span>  in every temptation,and preserve us <span class="scripture">&#8220;holy and unblameable and unreproveable&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+1%3A22" title="Colossians 1:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 1:22)</span></a></span> in His sight; living free from sin every moment and second of our lives? The omnipotence and omnipresence of God stop every mouth! <span class="scripture">&#8220;Where is the disputer of this world&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+1%3A20" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 1:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 1:20)</span></a></span> that will question His ability to do these things for us? Then one of two things must inevitably follow. Either we can <span class="scripture">&#8220;live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+2%3A12" title="Titus 2:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Titus 2:12)</span></a></span> or else God can, but will not, keep us. If He will not do so, then it is evident He does not want us to live pure and holy; in other words He allows sin in us, and justifies us in sin. Which would prove that He Himself has pleasure in unrighteousness. And that would prove Him unholy.</p>

<p>Again, let it be remembered that to make and keep us perfect, pure and spotless, is just what He has pledged Himself to do in all His <span class="scripture">&#8220;exceeding great and precious promises.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+1%3A4" title="II&nbsp;Peter 1:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 1:4)</span></a></span> If He will not do so, His word fails, and His character is divested of truthfulness; which would again strip Him of holiness.</p>

<p>Then it follows that to doubt God&#8217;s ability to make and keep us perfect in holiness, denies His infinity. And to question His willingness, is to deny His holiness. Therefore, any attempt to apologize for sin in any form and to any extent, robs God of His attributes, and reduces Him to no God. Here then is the conclusion of the whole matter: The Christian is no sinner, or God is no God. Therefore, thus saith the Lord,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+15%3A22" title="John 15:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 15:22)</span></a></span>
In the margin it is, &#8220;No excuse for sin.&#8221; If therefore, any man on earth who has heard gospel of God, supposes he has an excuse for sin and uncleanness, for not being what he &#8220;ought to be, and must be, and what God requires him to be,&#8221; he is deceived of the adversary of his soul; and will hear at the bar of God, these awful words: <span class="scripture">&#8220;I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+7%3A23" title="Matthew 7:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 7:23)</span></a></span> Oh, what multiplied thousands Satan has in this very trap!

<blockquote><p class="first">From <i>Christian&#8217;s Secret of a Happy Life</i>, by Hannah W. Smith; excerpt ascribed to a 17th-century Quaker.</p>
</blockquote>


<h1>To the Uttermost</h1>

<p>There is nothing so contrary to God as sin, and God will not suffer sin always to rule His masterpiece, man. When we consider the infiniteness of God&#8217;s power for destroying that which is contrary to Him, who can believe that the devil must always stand and prevail? I believe it is inconsistent and disagreeable with true faith for people to be Christians, and yet to believe that Christ, the eternal Son of God, to whom all power in heaven and earth is given, will suffer sin and the devil to have dominion over them.</p>

<p>But you will say no man by all the power he hath can redeem himself, and no man can live without sin. We will say, Amen, to it. But if men tell us that God&#8217;s power cannot be effected, when it comes to help us and to redeem us out of sin, then we cannot agree; nor I hope you neither.</p>

<p>Would you approve of it, if I should tell you that God puts forth His power to do such a thing, but the devil hinders Him? That it is impossible for God to do it because the devil does not like it? That it is impossible that any one should be free from sin because the devil hath got such a power in them that God cannot cast him out? This is lamentable doctrine, yet hath not this been preached? It doth in plain terms say, though God doth interpose His power, it is impossible, because the devil hath so rooted sin in the nature of man. Is not man God&#8217;s creature, and cannot He make him new, and cast sin out of him? If you say sin is deeply rooted in man, I say so, too, yet not so deeply rooted but Christ Jesus hath entered so deeply into the root of the nature of man that He hath received power to destroy the devil and his works, and to recover and redeem man into righteousness and holiness. Or else it is false that &#8220;he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him.&#8221; We must throw away the Bible, if we say that it is impossible for God to deliver man out of sin.</p>

<p>We know, when our friends are in captivity, as in Turkey, or elsewhere, we pay our money for their redemption; but we will not pay our money if they be kept in their fetters still. Would not any one think himself cheated to pay so much money for their redemption, and the bargain be made so that he shall be said to be redeemed, and be called a redeemed captive, but he must wear his fetters still? How long? As long as he hath a day to live.</p>

<p>This is for bodies, but now I am speaking of souls. Christ must be made to me redemption, and rescue me from captivity. Am I a prisoner anywhere? Yes, verily, verily, he that committeth sin, saith Christ, he is a servant of sin, he is a slave of sin. If thou hast sinned, thou art a slave, a captive that must be redeemed out of captivity. Who will pay a price for me? I am poor; I have nothing; I cannot redeem myself; who will pay a price for me? There is One come who hath paid a price for me. That is well; that is good news, then I hope I shall come out of my captivity. What is His name, is He called a Redeemer? So, then, I do expect the benefit of my redemption, and that I shall go out of my captivity. No, say they, you must abide in sin as long as you live. What! must we never be delivered? Must this crooked heart and perverse will always remain? Must I be a believer, and yet have no faith that reacheth to sanctification and holy living? Is there no mastery to be had, no getting victory over sin? Must it prevail over me as long as I live? What sort of a Redeemer, then, is this, or what benefit have I in this life, of my redemption?</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_9/Rightly_Understanding_the_Problem/index.html">Rightly Understanding the Problem</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Rightly Understanding the Problem</h1>

<p>He could count to 100. He could count by twos, by fives, and by tens&#8212;if he always started at one. If you required him to start at any other number, such as thirteen, he could not count very well, even by ones, and was totally lost in counting any other way.</p>

<p>Gary (name changed) was a very hard worker, exceptionally so for his eleven years. His attention span was longer than most eleven-year-olds&#8217;, too. He came to me because he was scheduled to go into the sixth grade and was having trouble with math. He was unable to carry and borrow (regroup). He was unable to carry and borrow because he did not understand our number system.</p>

<p>A great number of people do not understand the wonderful ingenuity of the place value aspect of our number system. Most folks pick up on it enough to become operational in the basic math areas: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. As is true of so many other things, this marvelous arrangement of digits can only be really appreciated when it is compared with other number systems that are inferior.</p>

<p>To illustrate: count to one hundred in Roman numerals. Then count to one-hundred in our Arabic number system. Try to add 17 + 93 in Roman numerals. Right away, you may realize the superiority of a system based on place value. Try to subtract 62 - 39. It is much easier in our place value system, is it not?</p>

<p>A great deal of attention had been expended on Gary as his needs became manifest. He had been drilled to a fair-thee-well on his addition facts and subtraction facts. He was used to long hours of practicing, practicing, practicing. Those who taught him had made a fundamental mistake. They had failed to realize that he did not grasp the key principle beneath all the drill. He was trying to memorize everything. This is impossible, of course. How can anyone memorize all the possible number combinations in addition and subtraction? He had memorized a lot&#8212;more than most young people his age. And he was a very hard worker&#8212;heroic&#8212;battling against impossible odds.</p>

<p>Gary came from a divorced home and lived with his mother during the school year. He attended a public school. His passiveness and diligence made it easy to assign him work for the practice it seemed he needed, and consequently, he stayed at a basically first grade level of math understanding through the end of the fifth grade, even though he could work certain kinds of subtraction and addition problems of about a third grade level. During the summer when he came for tutoring, Gary lived with his father and stepmother.</p>

<p>Gary and I started by counting. I drew a drawing of a number which revealed its place value, such as the number 241. The hundreds were a new frontier to him. (Just think, if you had carefully memorized all the numbers up to ninety-nine, carefully labeling each with its position in the counting hierarchy in your mind, how daunting it is to face all the hundreds, to say nothing of the thousands&#8230;.) He knew they were there, but he did not understand them. The entire concept of &#8220;roll over&#8221; was perfectly new to him, as well. &#8220;Roll over&#8221; is our term for what occurs when you run out of digits in one place value. For instance, when you reach 19 (one ten and nine ones) and count one higher, then all the nine ones vanish into a single ten which is completed by your new count and you end up with two tens and zero ones. This concept occurs everywhere in counting, and really gets dramatic when you roll over a number of place values as a result of counting up only one more. In the accompanying illustrations, the number, 2999, will roll over the ones, the tens, and the hundreds place values at the next count. The first drawing is before, the second is afterwards.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Foundation_Truth_9/understanding_numbers.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="222" /></div>
<p>It was very difficult for him to follow what happened when &#8220;roll over&#8221; occurred. I could draw it, before and after, but it was extremely hard for him to imagine what happened to produce the change.</p>

<p>I realized that what was needed was a computer program that actually did the &#8220;roll over&#8221; right before his eyes&#8212;over and over, with all kinds of number place value combinations.</p>

<p>I had never seen such a program, although I could visualize it. It is possible that such a program exists (as the wise man said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;There is no new thing under the sun&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ecclesiastes+1%3A9" title="Ecclesiastes 1:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ecclesiastes 1:9)</span></a></span>), but I did not know where to obtain it, and had a suspicion that it would be too costly for me to afford if I did stumble across it.</p>

<p>I have a good bit of experience writing business programs, but I had never had need to write a graphical representation and was therefore completely unacquainted with the techniques involved. Yet here was a great need. I prayed and asked the Lord to help me. Then I worked. I am sure that what I learned is elementary to programmers who work commonly in this area, but it seems miraculous to me, that in a week&#8217;s time, I was able to devise a program that illustrated counting up.</p>

<p>The effect on Gary was dramatic. He could see what he had not been able to imagine. He would count: 120&#8230;&#8203;121&#8230;&#8203;122&#8230;&#8203;123&#8230;&#8203;124&#8230;&#8203;125&#8230;&#8203;126&#8230;&#8203;127&#8230;&#8203;128&#8230;&#8203;129&#8230;&#8203;and then he would set up 129 on the computer program and watch carefully as the program &#8220;rolled over&#8221; into 130. Every school day that summer, Gary spent his afternoons doing this until he could count up and tell you the next number with a great deal of assurance and accuracy. (His hardest challenges were in the combinations 499 and 5999, etc.) Then we started counting backwards, which involves the concept of borrowing from place values to the left.</p>

<p>Finally, the counting concept was matched to actual numbers in addition and subtraction, and the effect was striking. I do not suppose I will ever forget the triumph on this boy&#8217;s face as he successfully subtracted numbers such as: 2000 - 678 without even referring to the &#8220;circle&#8221; program. His self-esteem had taken such a beating over the years as he fell farther and farther behind. It was good to see him getting some success under his belt.</p>

<p>The principle is a very profound one. No matter how hard we work or try, if we are fundamentally mistaken in our approach, the problem is not corrected. Sincerity and great effort are not enough in themselves; we must rightly understand the problem (judge correctly). How patient God is with us! How much He waits on us and desires to help us! He wants to bless us.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And therefore will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for the Lord is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+30%3A18" title="Isaiah 30:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 30:18)</span></a></span></p>

<h1>His Ways Are Higher</h1>

<p>My mom says that when I was younger, rather than talking, I would just make noises. Perhaps that&#8217;s still true. So it seemed like an excellent opportunity when I heard about the possibility of joining a homeschool music band near us.</p>

<p>During the summer, I&#8217;d been working on a construction job at my relatives&#8217;, and they graciously invited me to eat lunches with them. So it happened that in early September, I heard that two of my cousins were going to join a music band, one to learn the French horn, and the other the flute. I&#8217;d taken piano for several years, had received some basic instruction from my dad on trombone, and had gone to a few lessons for guitar, so this perked my interest. But with a full-time job causing me to realize how precious time was, I half laid aside thoughts of joining then as mere wishful thinking. Though maybe it would work out when the construction job finished sometime in the fall.</p>

<p>I thought about it some more when my cousins got back from their first session, telling me how fun it was. And so that evening I mentioned to my mom the thought of joining when my job was done. She thought it was a good idea, and mentioned it to my dad. So before bedtime, my dad just said that it was fine with him if I wanted to go when my job ended, and that I should pray about it.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t have time that night, as my evenings were crammed, and I figured I had awhile to consider it, so it wasn&#8217;t a priority. The next evening I had opportunity to talk more with my dad about it, and brought up the idea of taking time off so I could start sooner. Since the practice times were in the afternoon, they wouldn&#8217;t interfere with our times as a family in the evenings, though I&#8217;d have to get time off from work. My dad again said it was fine with him, but that I should make sure to pray about it, since one could never foresee what might be the outcome. He reminded me that we each have liberty in the Lord, and though some might not be able to do that, I should just let the Lord be my Guide. But I was very busy again that evening, so I left the decision until later.</p>

<p>The next day I took the opportunity to ask my boss for time off if I joined the music band. Monday and Wednesday afternoons. As I expected, it was fine with him; he thought it was a sign of an intelligent mind that I was musically bent. He asked what instrument I would play. Though it would be fun, I didn&#8217;t know whether I&#8217;d have time to spend in learning a new instrument, so I said I&#8217;d probably be doing trombone. He went on his way, and I returned to my task, feeling very grateful for the good employer the Lord had given me.</p>

<p>That evening my mom told me that the band only accepted new players up through the end of September, so I&#8217;d have to decide soon. So I made time that night to pray about the matter.</p>

<p>I opened my Bible, and after reading awhile without finding anything that seemed to apply to my case, I came to <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Chronicles+18">II&nbsp;Chronicles 18</a>. And I read how the true prophet told the kings not to go. When it came to me that this might be the Lord&#8217;s answer, I then and there realized how much I really <i>did</i> want to join the music band. I&#8217;d thought I could accept an answer either way, but I had to really consecrate then to not going. It was getting late, and I was tired, and so I asked the Lord that if this was His answer, He&#8217;d confirm it again later.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t often have particularly memorable dreams, but that night I dreamed about someone who was giving up a liberty&#8212;a perfectly legitimate thing&#8212;in order to stay in the will of God. I woke up right after that. It was quite early in the morning, and I lay there thinking about it. I didn&#8217;t want to place too much confidence in a dream, but it did seem to confirm what I&#8217;d been given so far. As I was thinking, I thought about how Brother Paul prayed three times about something, and I remembered how Brother Andrew, in <i>God&#8217;s Smuggler</i>, related that he, remembering Paul, had prayed three times for a wife. The third time the Lord said yes, and Brother Andrew received a blessing. So I told the Lord that I didn&#8217;t want to ignore what He&#8217;d already shown me, but that I&#8217;d like one more confirmation of His will.</p>

<p>I knew it would take a very strong yes to counter the no I&#8217;d received twice, and I felt that the answer should come from a third party, so to speak. So I had my personal devotions that morning without trying to get an answer about the music band. I thought maybe I would get the Lord&#8217;s reply in prayer meeting that night, or maybe Sunday&#8217;s service, so I set myself to be willing to wait.</p>

<p>But it came sooner than expected. We gathered around the table for family devotions, and read from I Kings. Coming to the <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Kings+22">twenty-second chapter</a>, we read part of the same story of Jehoshaphat and Ahab. And so I accepted the answer the Lord gave.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m thankful for the Lord&#8217;s guiding hand. I don&#8217;t altogether know why He wouldn&#8217;t have me go&#8212;His ways are higher than ours. But whatever His plans are for me, in music and everything else, I know it will be for His glory, and not mine.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+3%3A5-6" title="Proverbs 3:5-6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 3:5-6)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t need to know what lies ahead on our pathway. Only the next step.</p>

<p>&#8212;A brother in Christ</p>

<p>Adulthood implies responsibility in a broad sense&#8212;part of who you are and will become has always been your own decision, but adulthood implies a more complete sense of determining your course, with its privileges and its consequences. It is time to take responsibility, not just for yourself, but for your impact on other people, for no one is an island.</p>

<p>Each of us, due to our temperaments and training, enter adulthood at different stages&#8212;let me give myself as an example. I was quite responsible in the use of money by the time I was &#8220;on my own,&#8221; and was more skilled than most people my age at managing it. On the other hand, I was weak in certain areas of dealing responsibly with problems, which I illustrate with the incident below.</p>

<p>I was working in a friend&#8217;s shop on a window box for flowers. He had been teaching me how to use his tools and helped me design the boxes. In the process of using his router, I accidentally cut the power cord in two! No, I didn&#8217;t get electrocuted, but here was this tool that now didn&#8217;t operate. I apologized shamefacedly to my friend, and he surprised me by saying, &#8220;No problem, just take it and get it repaired for me and everything will be fine.&#8221; Now to some of you, this is a &#8220;no-brainer.&#8221; But I was used to just &#8220;being sorry&#8221; when I&#8217;d damaged something of somebody else&#8217;s. Taking the responsibility to &#8220;make it right&#8221; hit me two ways. First, I was startled a little by the responsibility. Second, I found the experience very satisfactory in the end. I didn&#8217;t have to feel &#8220;kind of bad&#8221; for awhile&#8212;I could &#8220;make things right&#8221;!</p>

<p>Many of you may find this a very remedial sort of lesson that you learned well long before you were entering adulthood. But I want to emphasize to you that each one of you are entering adulthood missing something that will seem basic to someone else. Praise God He knows that and knows just how to teach us if we&#8217;ll let Him. Wise people, whether they be 21 or 81, recognize their limitations and God&#8217;s greatness, and reach out their hand and place it in the bigger, stronger, wiser hand of God.</p>

<p>Being a male is an additional aspect. To understand what manliness is requires some understanding of the peculiar strengths and weaknesses of men and women. Let us examine a couple passages of scripture that give counsel to men and women.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church. Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A22-33" title="Ephesians 5:22-33"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 5:22-33)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Notice that women are counseled to submit to their husbands, and reverence them, and that men are counseled to love their wives as they love themselves. Aren&#8217;t wives supposed to love their husbands as they love themselves? Yes, but the challenge of being in a submissive role is greater. Their difficulties lie in the fact that they have plenty of ideas how things ought to go, that they think differently than men, and that a wife gets plenty of experience suffering from their husband&#8217;s mistakes or neglect. It&#8217;s easy not to &#8220;reverence&#8221; the husband, and not a small job to submit to them, under those circumstances.</p>

<p>Notice that the husbands here are given a rather basic prodding here not to be self-centered. A man tends to be absorbed in his work, play, and &#8220;doing things.&#8221; If you are engaged or a newlywed, maybe you think this counsel unnecessary. You delight to show love to your wife! But a man&#8217;s focus naturally reverts to accomplishing and doing and providing, and his natural bent will be on his own world. Here then is counsel, not just for those contemplating marriage or for the married, but for all men. You are not all God designed for you to be unless you are engaging yourself in loving­&#8212;take yourself in hand to consider others, how to actually benefit them.</p>

<p>Just prior to this passage, everyone (men included) are admonished to submit to one another. But in a particular way, God has put men in a leadership position in their families and in society as a whole. A leader must learn to consider and love others, or he will become a tyrant. The very tendency to be more naturally detached equips a man to lead soberly and impartially, if he will use that tendency in the right context.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+2%3A8-10" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 2:8-10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 2:8-10)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>A man gives way to wrath and doubting more easily, and a woman to the seductions of beauty and wanting to be attractive. This is not to say that women don&#8217;t ever get angry, or men don&#8217;t ever get focused on their appearance or beauty. However, men are more prone to lift up unholy hands to fight, or solve problems with force, and, being more naturally self-reliant, find it more difficult to wait and trust God to handle things, since we can&#8217;t rely on ourselves and God simultaneously. God has fighting for men to do&#8212;spiritual fighting, with &#8220;holy hands,&#8221; praying! God has beauty for women to aspire to&#8212;inner beauty, the beauty of good works. The &#8220;like manner&#8221; suggests that both men and women must turn from the natural and turn to the spiritual&#8212;each one has a battle similar in nature, of restraining their natural inclinations and seeking those things that God has for them. Young man, be a real fighter! Not a physical fighter, but a spiritual fighter! Even in the Old Covenant, when defending a physical kingdom meant physical warfare, David was an example of calling upon God, leaning on Him, and looking to Him to direct his battles. How much more now that we have inherited a kingdom
<span class="scripture">&#8220;not of this world.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+18%3A36" title="John 18:36"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 18:36)</span></a></span>
God designed for you to solve countless problems on your knees in humility and dependence on Him, overcoming spiritual enemies!</p>

<blockquote><p class="first">From <i>Tiger and Tom and Other Stories for Boys</i></p>
</blockquote>


<h1>The Best Fun</h1>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys, I&#8217;ll tell you how we can have some fun,&#8221; said Fred Blake to his companions, who had assembled on a beautiful, moonlight evening for sliding, snowballing, and fun generally.</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; &#8220;Where?&#8221; &#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked several eager voices together.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard Widow More tell a man a little while ago,&#8221; replied Fred, &#8220;that she would go to sit up with a sick child tonight. Now, as soon as she is gone, let&#8217;s make a big snow man on her doorstep so that when she comes home, she cannot get in without first knocking him down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Capital!&#8221; shouted several of the boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; said Charlie Neal, &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you the best fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; again inquired several at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait awhile,&#8221; said Charlie. &#8220;Who has a wood saw?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; &#8220;So have I,&#8221; answered three of the boys. &#8220;But what in the world do you want a wood saw for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall see,&#8221; replied Charlie. &#8220;It is almost eight o&#8217;clock now, so go and get your saws. You, Fred and Nathan, get each an axe, and I will get a shovel. Let us all be back here in fifteen minutes, and then I&#8217;ll show you the fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys separated to go on their several errands, each wondering what the fun could be, and what possible use could be made of wood saws and axes, in their play. But Charlie was not only a great favorite with them all, but also an acknowledged leader, and they fully believed in him and his promise.</p>

<p>Anxious to know what the &#8220;fun&#8221; was which Charlie had for them, they made haste, and were soon on hand, with their saws, axes, and shovels.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Charlie, &#8220;Mrs. More is gone, for I met her when I was coming back; so let&#8217;s be off at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what are you going to do?&#8221; inquired several impatient members of the party.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall see directly,&#8221; replied the leader, as they approached the humble home of Mrs. More.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys,&#8221; said Charlie, &#8220;you see that pile of wood; a man hauled it here this afternoon, and I heard Mrs. More tell him that unless she got someone to saw it tonight, she would have nothing to make a fire with in the morning. Now, we can saw and split that pile of wood just about as easy as we could build a great snow man, and when Mrs. More comes home from her watching, she will be fully as much surprised to find her wood sawed, as she would to find a snow man at her doorstep, and a great deal more pleasantly, too. What say you&#8212;will you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>One or two of the boys demurred at first, but the majority were in favor of Charlie&#8217;s project; so all finally joined in, and went to work with a will.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go round to the back of the shed,&#8221; said Charlie, &#8220;and crawl through the window and unfasten the door. Then we&#8217;ll take turns in sawing, splitting, and carrying in the wood; and I want to pile it up nicely, and to shovel all the snow away from the door; and make a good wide path, too, from the door to the street: What fun it will be when she comes home and sees it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys began to appreciate the fun, for they felt that they were doing a good deed, and experienced the satisfaction which always results from well-doing.</p>

<p>It was not a long, wearisome job for seven robust and healthy boys to saw, split, and pile up the poor widow&#8217;s half-cord of wood, and to shovel a good path.</p>

<p>When it was done, so great was their pleasure that one of the boys, who objected to the work at first, proposed that they should go to a neighboring carpenter&#8217;s shop, where plenty of shavings could be had for carrying away, and each bring an armful of kindling wood. This they did, and afterward hurried home, all of them more than satisfied with the &#8220;fun&#8221; of the winter evening.</p>

<p>The next morning, when Mrs. More came home, weary from watching by the sick bed, and saw what was done, she was very much surprised. When she was told who had done it, by a neighbor who had witnessed the kindly deed, her fervent prayer, &#8220;God bless the boys!&#8221; was, of itself, an abundant reward for their labors.</p>

<p>Boys and girls, the best fun is always found in doing something that is kind and useful. If you doubt it in the least, just try it for yourselves, and you will be convinced.</p>

<h1>The Pretty Plate Blessing</h1>

<p>One day, many years ago, when a youth, I sat with my family at my aunt&#8217;s dinner table. She had set the table with plates from her china cabinet. They were all white with a raised design of fruits. These were the whitest plates I had ever seen. As the food was passed around and we all filled our plates, I couldn&#8217;t help but notice how beautifully the food looked on these totally opaque, glossy white plates!</p>

<p>When the time came for choosing plates for my home, what kind of plates was I drawn to? Why of course, I remembered that incident and started searching for white plates. I heard about the new Corelle that was out, and the glowing testimonies of its durability. But their solid white with absolutely no scallop or raised design seemed rather plain. But after searching, it seemed there was nothing else to be found. At last, the plain white Corelle was settled on. They have functioned well, with many different children washing them, with only a few broken ones, compared to all the use, over the last two decades. There was nothing to complain about. They had served me well.</p>

<p>Then, one day at a garage sale I found a few white Corelle plates with a light gray outline of five-petaled flowers, with vine and leaves. It was beautiful! Where had this design come from? It was never seen in the display at the retail shops! It was just the delicate little touch I had desired! For a small price, they were purchased with the hope of some day finding some more to match them.</p>

<p>Time went on; I was shopping at the Goodwill, and guess what I found?! Six big plates with those little, five-petaled flowers! There were six of them for only 99 cents each. I had four; this would give me 10 big plates. I promptly put them in my cart. Then a conversation with my husband came back to my mind. He had recently mentioned that I should not spend money on any thing that we really didn&#8217;t need. Did I really <i>need</i> these plates? No, I had plates. But this is a rare find, I argued! I stood there, trying to find a way that would be permissible to obtain them. I even thought of calling my husband and asking if I could purchase them since it was only a little under six dollars. But he had already told me not to buy anything that we really didn&#8217;t have to have, as the budget was going to be rather tight the next month or so. So they were placed back on the shelf. As I walked away, I knew that the Lord could provide them again, if it were His will for me to have them.</p>

<p>Months passed, and one day just recently a neighbor called. She asked me what pattern in Corelle I had. She was at a sale and had found six big plates, pie plates and cups in that rare design for only $2! She hadn&#8217;t had a clue of my struggle that day at the Goodwill, almost a year ago. But the Lord knew about it. How blessed I felt! And it cost even less for the larger amount!</p>

<p>In pondering this blessing, I was so glad I obeyed my husband and the Lord. In using the plates, I feel blessed and happy. If I had not listened, I would not have the blessing. How important it is for us to live in God&#8217;s blessing zone.</p>

<h1>A Mother&#8217;s Mistaken Kindness</h1>

<p>It is a mistaken kindness for mothers to do too much to make life easy for their children. However desirous they may be to shield their little ones from care and responsibility, such things are inevitable; and the child who is taught early in life to meet disappointment and failure with a brave heart is more wisely equipped than with a queen&#8217;s dowry.</p>

<p>I know a mother who toiled early and late to save her daughter from the hardships that had beset her own life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Julia shall never know what it is to drudge as I have,&#8221; she was wont to say. &#8220;If she never learns how, she will not be so likely to have it to do.&#8221; And so, handicapped by ill health and a scanty income, she yet managed to keep Julia&#8217;s hands out of dish water, from the broom, the duster, the mixing bowl and the ironing board.</p>

<p>The child as she grew to girlhood, found other and more congenial avenues open, and naturally availed herself of the privilege which immunity from household duties afforded her, of equipping herself for a life work that promised splendid possibilities.</p>

<p>The girl was bright, alert and willing. In her own chosen profession her career seemed full of promise. Her mother, proud of her daughter&#8217;s achievements, continued to keep the domestic machinery oiled and running; and the daughter saw not the fading cheek and faltering footsteps until, one day, they were missing from their wonted place, and an untrained, incompetent girl found herself suddenly called upon to take her mother&#8217;s place as a homemaker.</p>

<p>The experience was a hard one. The work which her mother had apparently done with so little effort seemed an herculean task to her untrained head and hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never supposed that you had to plan housework,&#8221; she said to one of her mother&#8217;s friends who happened in, one day, to see how the household duties were progressing in the absence of the director of affairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you ever help your mother about the house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; mother never seemed to want me to and I, of course, was glad enough to get rid of it,&#8221; was the candid answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;But now you wish you were a little more experienced, I fancy,&#8221; her mother&#8217;s friend made answer, as she laid a sympathetic hand against the girl&#8217;s flushed cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just now, Mrs. Wentworth, I would give all my artistic training to know how to make and bake a pan of biscuits such as mother used to make. Look at these!&#8221; Julia exclaimed in a tear-choked voice. She took from the table a pan of soggy looking biscuits, the tops of which were blackened from a over-heated oven. &#8220;Mother always seemed to do all these things so easily,&#8221; she said, smiling ruefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you imagine that she did them without effort or experience?&#8221; kindly questioned her visitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know. Mother never talked with me about her work. She always said she&#8217;d rather I&#8217;d be educated for something besides housework. But I don&#8217;t think a mixture of the two would have harmed me,&#8221; she whimsically replied as she relegated her uneatable pan of biscuits to the garbage pail.</p>

<h1>Drop a Pebble in the Water</h1>

<p class="author">James W. Foley</p>

<p class="verse">Drop a pebble in the water: just a splash, and it is gone;
<br />But there&#8217;s half-a-hundred ripples circling on and on and on,
<br />Spreading, spreading from the center, flowing on out to the sea.
<br />And there is no way of telling where the end is going to be.</p>

<p class="verse">Drop a pebble in the water: in a minute you forget,
<br />But there&#8217;s little waves a-flowing, and there&#8217;s ripples circling yet,
<br />And those little waves a-flowing to a great big wave have grown;
<br />You&#8217;ve disturbed a mighty river just by dropping in a stone.</p>

<p class="verse">Drop an unkind word, or careless: in a minute it is gone;
<br />But there&#8217;s half-a-hundred ripples circling on and on and on.
<br />They keep spreading, spreading, spreading from the center as they go,
<br />And there is no way to stop them, once you&#8217;ve started them to flow.</p>

<p class="verse">Drop an unkind word, or careless: in a minute you forget;
<br />But there&#8217;s little waves a-flowing, and there&#8217;s ripples circling yet,
<br />And perhaps in some sad heart a mighty wave of tears you&#8217;ve stirred,
<br />And disturbed a life was happy ere you dropped that unkind word.</p>

<p class="verse">Drop a word of cheer and kindness: just a flash and it is gone;
<br />But there&#8217;s half-a-hundred ripples circling on and on and on,
<br />Bearing hope and joy and comfort on each splashing, dashing wave
<br />Till you wouldn&#8217;t believe the volume of the one kind word you gave.</p>

<p class="verse">Drop a word of cheer and kindness: in a minute you forget;
<br />But there&#8217;s gladness still a-swelling, and there&#8217;s joy a circling yet,
<br />And you&#8217;ve rolled a wave of comfort whose sweet music can be heard
<br />Over miles and miles of water just by dropping one kind word.</p>

<h1>Nothing Like a Freshly-Made Pie</h1>

<p>If you have not experienced the joy of eating a freshly-made pie, you have missed out on some very delicious eating. It was not until I sampled a store-bought pie at a family get-together some years ago that I knew how one would turn down a piece of pie. We all have our preferences of taste in foods, but I do believe that a well-made pie can be enjoyed by all.</p>

<p>The other day I discovered for myself the disappointment of an unsatisfactory pie&#8212;one that I had assembled and baked myself. This was a lesson to me that seasonings can make a real difference. I had baked pie many times, but did not know that apricot pie needed something special. This is especially important when the fruit needs some perking up. My friend is an exceptional cook and her pies are absolutely wonderfully delicious. After this experience, I asked her if there was anything special that she used for apricot pies. Her response was, &#8220;Yes, my mother found a recipe in the Taste of Home magazine that is really delicious.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another important thing that one needs to know about baking pies is how to make a flaky crust. The crust has as much to do as the filling in the overall taste of a pie. Last week, we again put this lesson to the test. We had a couple of pies that we had planned to make, and my youngest daughter helped to roll out the pie crust. My eldest daughter was preparing the filling. Before she knew it, she found my youngest daughter in the act of kneading the pie crust. Well, if you don&#8217;t know what happens to crust under such conditions, it makes one tough crust. We had our friends over when the pies were served, and they wondered what pie crust recipe we had used for our pies! I hope it was a lesson learned by all!</p>

<p>I am so happy that our son is witnessing the many trials, frustrations and mistakes that a homemaker encounters in everyday life, as it is the lot of every lady, no matter how careful she is. I am thankful that we can learn and go on in victory in our spirits (by the grace of God) as we encounter such experiences.</p>

<p>These recent experiences helped me realize that each of us really want the very best in life. This helped me to understand more fully the ways of the Lord. He has the very best for us, but in order to get it we need to go to Him who knows how to guide and instruct us in His ways. There are many sources for us to get information in this life, and Satan is crafty at getting us satisfied without experiencing true satisfaction. It takes a recognition of this as well as a consecration to keep pressing out for the best. Yes, there is no doubt that if we take God&#8217;s way, we will have the very best as He is the one who has designed us and knows the make-up of true happiness. He is the expert!</p>

<p>Here are a few fresh fruit pie recipes with wonderful seasoning combinations, as well as an easy stir and roll crust recipe. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Remove top paper. Lift up crust with bottom wax paper still secure. Arrange evenly over pie plate, then remove wax paper. Ease crust in place, being careful not to stretch dough, as that causes shrinkage. Pour in fruit filling.</p>

<p>After crimping the edges together, remember to cut small slits in the top crust to encourage stem to escape on top rather than at the seam lines.</p>

<p>Note: A pie that is placed on the bottom rack of the oven will brown nicely on the bottom crust and the top crust will not be as likely to get too brown before the pie is baked.</p>

<h2>Non-Gluten Pie Crust</h2>
<p>This is a wonderful crust for those who are allergic to wheat products. The best part, for me, is that you can work with it as much as you like, and it will not be tough when it is baked!</p>

<p>It also can be rolled out (on plastic like the oil crust) and designs or lattice made for the top.</p>

<h2>Donna Jo&#8217;s Dream Pastry</h2>
<p>Makes two 9&#8221; crusts + 1 crust</p>

<p>Before we found this recipe, my mom and I would substitute barley flour for wheat in the oil crust recipe. It had to be handled so gently, and would often break before we could get it in place. Plus, it tasted different&#8212;a little stronger than whole wheat crust.</p>

<p>Were we ever happy to find that the above recipe tastes very much like regular pie crust, just a teeny bit sweeter, and a little drier.</p>

<p>If you want more recipes by Bette Hagman, this was found in <i>More from the Gluten-Free Gourmet</i>, which I think is a wonderful book. (Plus, check out her bread book if you like bread, but can&#8217;t eat wheat!)</p>

<h2>Tips on Pastry-Making</h2>
<p>If you are doing several pies, it will be worth your while to cut the sides of a 2-gallon plastic bag, and roll between the plastic bag sides. It lasts longer and doesn&#8217;t wrinkle as much.</p>

<p>Dampening the counter top with a little water helps the bag stay in place and not slip and slide around.</p>

<p>For cream pies, prick crusts with a fork. Sometimes, during baking they still puff up. Just prick them again in the puffy places. Reminds you of children, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

<h2>Best Flour</h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The perfect tenderness of a pie crust is a delicate matter. Very little gluten is needed to hold the crust together, and more gluten than this makes the crust tough. One way to minimize the amount of gluten-forming proteins is to use a flour that has less protein in the first place. Pastry flour and a few Southern all-purpose flours are low in protein (8-9 grams of protein per cup). These low-protein flours produce much less gluten and much more tender pie crust, biscuits, and cakes.</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[Corriher, Shirley O.; <i>CookWise</i>]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>The least expensive way to buy pastry flour is to purchase it from a grocery that sells baking products in bulk. If that isn&#8217;t available, for a substitute, place 2 tablespoons of cornstarch in each cup measure before filling up with all-purpose flour.</p>

<p>For those of you who want to use whole grains, use a soft white wheat to grind for your pastry flour.</p>

<h2>Need a Richer Looking Crust?</h2>
<p>Have you made a fruit pie that looked pale and sad? Isn&#8217;t a rich-looking, nicely-browned, flaky crust much more enticing? One simple way is to brush on milk (put milk in a spray bottle and spray milk on, if baking a lot of pies) and then sprinkle liberally with sugar before baking.</p>

<p>There was a old Southern chef in Atlanta who added a tablespoon of frozen orange juice concentrate when making pie crust. It is partially frozen, so it helps chill the crust for flakiness. It is acidic, so it tenderizes. If you remember, some pie crusts recipes call for vinegar. Ever wonder why? It&#8217;s acidic, and that tenderizes! Isn&#8217;t it interesting to know <i>why</i> we add certain ingredients? The orange juice also adds a nice hint of flavor and a little color. Would be especially good for peach and apricot pies.</p>

<p>&#8212;E.S.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<div class="blurb">
<p class="first">I believe we have used enough space up for this time about pies, and we haven&#8217;t even started talking about the cream ones with meringue and whipped cream. So we will save them for next time.</p>

<p>We trust the thoughts of this issue will be a blessing to you. Continue to be faithful in delighting yourself in the Lord, and then it will naturally overflow to your husbands and fathers. May God bless each of you.</p>

<p>&#8212;Elois</p>

<h1>Keep Them Away, Please!</h1>

<p>I was seven or eight and we had lived in a trailer court for as long as I could remember. I had seen home videos of our old home in Oklahoma where I had room to run and play without being constantly accosted by other children who always acted the way I wasn&#8217;t supposed to. But that was a hazy dream. People always wanted my Mama&#8212;maybe they wanted to push me out. So in my way I would push back.</p>

<p>Mama would say to me, &#8220;You are the oldest&#8221; (that was true, I thought proudly, all the other children were <i>younger</i> than me); &#8220;so,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;you need to be an example to them of how they ought to act.&#8221; So I tried with all I had. When the skinny, hyper-active, copper-haired girl next door was over with her sister playing dolls, I would be nice and patient and use all my skill to keep bad words and fighting out of our play.</p>

<p>I was big and my sister was little, and she copied whatever I did. She would copy my attitudes, posture, work, <i>everything</i>! She&#8217;d copy me in how I played with the children on the outside. And if she was copying me doing something wrong, Mama said it was nearly all my fault.</p>

<p>The skinny, copper-haired girl&#8217;s mama was always coming in our house, except when Daddy was home in the evening (inside herself she must be scared of him, I thought, or else she wouldn&#8217;t go away). She must want my mama for herself, I decided; all the children want my mama&#8212;they asked if we would trade mamas and take mine. <i>I don&#8217;t want their mamas!</i> Quickly I&#8217;d push away that horrid thought. But still the fear would linger, <i>what if they&#8217;d get her after all?</i> I&#8217;d be all forgotten. All alone.</p>

<p>One day the last straw was pulled by Brandi, the mama next door. For a reason I now can&#8217;t remember, we were under her watch, Mama was around but very occupied with helping someone or something, and us children had just agreed what we were going to play&#8212;Legos. My sister and I had the most because Daddy must have loved Legos just as much as we did, and gave us little surprises every so often. Legos were important to me, as fun to play with as playing house or school. So it was <i>our</i> Legos we children decided to play with since we had the most. Brandi was getting impatient, a very common occurrence&#8212;all the children rattling around and she had work to do. So she took the two Lego bases, six inches by six inches, and broke each into quarters and shoved them at each child. I was horrified! Being a quiet child, I was rather mild toward others, but when she did that something inside me snapped. <i>Those are my bases!</i> I mutely screamed, <i>and <b>you</b>&#8212;the one that wants to take my mama away&#8212;have broken them into tiny pieces that I can&#8217;t ever use again. I&#8217;m the oldest child and have handled this group before (and didn&#8217;t need your help, either, just my mom&#8217;s) and I had a plan how we all could peaceably work on two bases. I was going to make a bridge, a kind of long, wide one, and we all could build houses on top of it. I was going to make it work; they would have listened to me, they think my ideas are great because I&#8217;m bigger than they are and they like to copy me.</i></p>

<p>Mama didn&#8217;t seem to think it was any big deal when I told her at home and solemnly showed her the broken bases. She said that I was right not to yell at Brandi and make a scene, and that, no, it wasn&#8217;t right for her to break our Lego bases without asking; that I had been a good example. Basically, she was proud of me for doing what was right. That assurance stayed in my mind until I remembered the look that passed over her face when I said Brandi had broken it without asking me anything&#8212;just took it and broke it like it was hers. Did Mama think Brandi was taking over? Was she going to become my mama and I would have to do what <i>she</i> said? I felt sick. I&#8217;d had a plan for those Legos, and it would have worked. I didn&#8217;t feel safe anymore; that lady could just reach into whatever she wanted.</p>

<p>I began to resent her and her little girls. They were always with us when we picked berries or peaches or went to the park. They&#8217;d can fruit and vegetables with us; always they were with us, dividing us from Mama, making me be a good example for the unruly offspring of the impatient mama next door. Mama wouldn&#8217;t listen to me; well, she listened, but she wouldn&#8217;t do the important thing&#8212;send them away. At least <i>Daddy</i> could send them away; he was strong. He didn&#8217;t even push them, or say, &#8220;Go home.&#8221; His presence would make them go away.</p>

<p>One afternoon, it was quiet; the sunshine was coming in through our large, living room windows. I went out of the kitchen to find Mama.</p>

<p>The laundry room was dark compared to the light from where I had just come, but Mama was there doing something on the dryer. &#8220;What are you doing, Mama?&#8221; I asked, cozying up to her; she felt so comfortable. She was cutting fabric with her pinking sheers. One was green gingham, another yellow gingham, and the other was white. <i>Maybe she is cutting out hearts,</i> I thought, but she wasn&#8217;t. Just large squares. <i>Why ordinary old squares? Were they curtains for my dollhouse? No, they were too big.</i> &#8220;Are they for our dolls?&#8221; <i>They could be a blanket for Jane.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Mama said, smiling, &#8220;they&#8217;re not for your dolls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are they for?&#8221; I said. <i>Maybe it was a surprise for Abigail.</i> &#8220;I can keep a secret,&#8221; my expectant voice rose in triumphant hope only to hear Mama&#8217;s pleasant, &#8220;You&#8217;ll see.&#8221; My sister and I followed her outside to the paper box. Inside I was hopping up and down; I <i>had</i> to figure out this mystery.</p>

<p>Mama took a clothes pin and pinned the square of cloth to the stake that held up the box for the newspaper man. The cloth draped over the stake; it looked disappointing. In fact it looked kind of forlorn there all by itself. &#8220;It&#8217;s a flag,&#8221; Mama said. &#8220;When we have a story with the children we will put up the white flag&#8212;white because Jesus can make us white inside. When we have play time together we will put up the green flag (we smiled); when it is school time or time for just us, we will hang the yellow flag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they don&#8217;t look like flags,&#8221; I said. <i>Flags go out straight.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;It will be alright,&#8221; Mama said. I wasn&#8217;t as sure as I walked back into the house, looking over my shoulder at the yellow cloth hanging on the stake. It looked sort of tacky.</p>

<p>Maybe it was the next day, but I was behind Mama when she answered the door. Who wanted her now? The important question: <i>would it take very long?</i></p>

<p>It was the children outside. &#8220;No, you can&#8217;t come over right <i>now</i>,&#8221; I heard Mama firmly say. <i>She always has to say that,</i> I thought, disgustedly. <i>Why can&#8217;t you guys find something else to do than always hang around here?</i> But then I heard her say, &#8220;See that flag down there? When it turns green you can come play and when it&#8217;s white we will have Bible story time. Okay?!&#8221;</p>

<p>I could feel their disappointment where I stood, four feet from the door, as they turned and tramped down the old stairs. But I stood still, feeling a warm glow spread through me&#8212;the flag had worked; it kept them away!</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<div class="blurb">
<p class="first">My mother and father thought this up to bring some peace into our home while living in a trailer court. She says that the doorbell was ringing constantly from mothers wanting to borrow or learn something and from their children wanting to play. I am grateful for her care of me.</p>

<h1>Kindness</h1>

<p class="author">Charles E. Orr</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Be ye kind one to another.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+4%3A32" title="Ephesians 4:32"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 4:32)</span></a></span> The nature and the extent of the kindness we are to have to one another are plainly suggested by the remainder of the text. As God for Christ&#8217;s sake has forgiven us, so we for His sake should forgive one another. This implies that in tenderheartedness and kindness we should be Christlike. As He is kind and tender to us, so we should be kind and tender to others. Kindness is not something to be put on outwardly but is to adorn the inward man; it is a disposition of the heart. He whose hidden man of the heart is adorned with the sweet grace of kindness finds great delight in making others happy. Kindness is exercised toward others by cheerfully doing what we can to lighten their burdens, to aleviate their suffering, to supply their needs, to encourage and cheer them.</p>

<p>Kindness is a fruit of love. <span class="scripture">&#8220;suffereth long, and is kind.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+13%3A4" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 13:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 13:4)</span></a></span> We are kind to those whom we love. It is only when love fills our hearts that we can be <span class="scripture">&#8220;kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+12%3A10" title="Romans 12:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 12:10)</span></a></span></p>

<p>I will ask you, my dear reader, a question, not to condemn you, but to awaken you to a thoughtful consideration of your life. Are you a husband? If so, are you as kind to your wife as you should be? Do you cheerfully and delightfully do what you can to lighten her burdens and to sweeten her life? Have you a deep concern for her happiness? Do you sympathize with her as you should when she is suffering? Are your words always as soft, as mild, and as full of tenderness and love as they should be? Is there ever a tinge of bitterness in your words? Do they have the least sharpness or hastiness? Are you a wife? read over the above questions and apply them to yourself. Are you a father or a mother? Are you as kind to those tender olive plants that God has given you as you should be? Does there sometimes a little crossness or sharpness get into your words? Oh! be careful, be prayerful, dearly beloved, lest there come over you a fretful, careless feeling very similar to impatience or anger, and cause you to speak too hastily and too harshly. Be careful to keep mild and sweet under the most trying circumstances. Be a conqueror in every hour of temptation.</p>

<p>I think I can almost hear someone saying, &#8220;I am not as kind to my family as I should be.&#8221; Are you endeavoring to improve? There is hope for the man who realizes that he is not as patient and kind as he should be, but who is putting forth every effort and earnestly pleading with God that he may be more kind. Cultivate the disposition of kindness. It is a sweet and beautiful grace. It is full of perfume. It will cheer and gladden the hearts of others. It will brighten your home and make it an Eden. Put on, O beloved saint, put on kindness. Do not allow ugly feelings to creep over you and cause you to act hastily or to speak harshly. Give such no place in your life. Impatient feelings mar the image of Jesus in the soul, and they will rob your life of its sweet fragrance. Always be cheerful, never gloomy; always wear a smile, never a frown; always be kind, and never ill or impatient&#8212;if you would have a close walk with God and be like Him.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_9/O_Lord_Give_Me_an_Unselfish_Heart/index.html">O Lord, Give Me an Unselfish Heart</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>O Lord, Give Me an Unselfish Heart</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>The Lord has laid on my heart to share with you how He has been working in my heart recently. I feel quite incapable of writing this, but I trust that the Lord will give me all the words to write. He is so good, and so very faithful. I feel so unworthy at times of His love. May through my testimony your heart be blessed and the Lord be glorified&#8230;.</p>

<p>The Lord began to speak to me, and unveiled my eyes to something in my life that I didn&#8217;t realize was there and that He didn&#8217;t want there. Something that didn&#8217;t at all reflect the glorious, holy God that I so desired to serve and to be like. I came to the painful reality that I held selfish motives and was being quite selfish at times. In my own round-about way, I was often thinking of my own comforts, my own desires, and wanting to do things my own way. I was being selfish toward my own dear family. (Yet, being unselfish towards others outside my family! In parallel to <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+3%3A10-12">James 3:10-12</a>, &#8220;this cannot be.&#8221;) This grieved my heart, and the Lord&#8217;s too. How could I have been so blinded? I love my family so very much. But the Lord showed me that true love is not selfish, at all. For love <span class="scripture">&#8220;seeketh not her own.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+13%3A5" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 13:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 13:5)</span></a></span> &#8220;Sincere love is love wholly free from self-interest.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../texts/Helps_to_Holy_Living/Love_to_Christ/index.html" title="Helps to Holy Living/Love to Christ">*</a></p>

<p>Jesus was our greatest Example of one who lived a perfectly selfless life. Christ <i>never</i> thought of His own needs and own comforts, but always of others&#8217;. The very reason He came to earth was to lay down His life for us&#8212;filthy, sinful us who didn&#8217;t even care for Him&#8212;and that was the supreme display of true unselfishness. It was from His great love that His selflessness flowed. I realized that if I loved as Jesus loved, it would leave <i>no</i> room for selfishness, not even in the smallest form.</p>

<p>Upon looking up the word <i>selfish</i> in the dictionary, it made me think even more. <i>Selfish</i> is defined as, &#8220;regarding one&#8217;s own comfort, advantage, etc. in disregard, or at the expense, of that of others.&#8221;</p>

<p>That stung. I wanted to say that I really wasn&#8217;t <i>that</i> selfish. But when the Lord speaks, He always speaks truth. And to God, selfishness is selfishness, no matter how great or little it may seem. All selfishness is <i>wrong</i>. Perhaps my selfishness wasn&#8217;t outright seen by others, but it was there in my heart none the less. And God desired to remove that from me.</p>

<p>How thankful, ever so thankful I am that the Lord opened my blinded eyes! When one truly seeks the Lord, He is faithful to reveal any areas in their lives that isn&#8217;t pleasing unto Him. My desire is to be more like Christ. And if Christ was in no way selfish, then I must not be selfish in any way either. For <i>Christian</i> means &#8220;Christ-like,&#8221; and any form of selfishness would definitely <i>not</i> be Christ-like! As <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+1%3A10">Colossians 1:10</a> says, I am to <span class="scripture">&#8220;walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>I have found that the more I seek the Lord and desire His perfect way, the more my selfishness melts away. If my focus is fully on Jesus, and how I may serve, obey, and please Him more, then being selfless will come naturally. There is no way that one can be selfish and have their eyes fully on Jesus. It&#8217;s like trying to serve two masters (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+6%3A24">Matthew 6:24</a>), and that does not work! I can only serve one or the other&#8212;the Lord or myself.</p>

<p>Satan is so deceitful and sly in his ways, and tries in any way he can to lure me and get me to fail, especially since he knows that I mean business and want to obey the Lord no matter what. The devil tries so very hard at times to get me discouraged&#8212;he wants me to fall (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+5%3A8">I&nbsp;Peter 5:8</a>). But when he flings at me his fiery darts, and tempts me sore to think of my own desires, or to want to do things my own way, I run to Jesus for strength. His Word promises,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+10%3A13" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 10:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 10:13)</span></a></span>
He supplies all the grace and strength I need! Praise Him!</p>

<p>And He can give you, too, all the grace and strength to overcome whatever He may be dealing with in your heart. God is a God of love, and compassion, and is ever ready to help us, if only we will accept it. He gives us a choice. In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+9%3A8">II&nbsp;Corinthians 9:8</a> it says, And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work. (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;q="></a>) God is here to help us in our weaknesses, to make us strong, and to completely change our hearts. Praise Him! He is
<span class="scripture">&#8220;able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+3%3A20" title="Ephesians 3:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 3:20)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Oh, dear sisters, may we <i>always</i> keep our hearts tender and in tune with the Holy Spirit so that we can hear His still small voice when He speaks to us. Only in His blessed will can we find true peace, joy, and contentment. Let us
<span class="scripture">&#8220;grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory both now, and for ever. Amen.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+3%3A18" title="II&nbsp;Peter 3:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 3:18)</span></a></span>

<h1>Danger in the Comfort Zone</h1>

<p>&#8220;I just wanted to talk to you about that class situation&#8212;to get your perspective on it,&#8221; my co-teacher stated. She had taken me out for lunch &#8220;to get away from the school for awhile.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sighed inwardly, trying to rethink my arguments. &#8220;Well, I just don&#8217;t see how I can work that new student in. It&#8217;s hard enough to handle the group and take an interest in each one.&#8221; I could envision myself trying to keep pace with that long row of children facing me each morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need to learn to read them. To be spontaneous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not spontaneous. I can&#8217;t think unless I&#8217;m organized,&#8221; I almost pleaded. As I reconstructed in my mind that feeling of near panic, a new insight came to me. &#8220;It&#8217;s just the way I feel when I&#8217;m in any large group,&#8221; I tried to explain. &#8220;When I&#8217;m in grocery stores I never notice people around me. I shut everyone out and just focus on getting the job done. And that&#8217;s the way it is when I work with a larger class.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it is out of your comfort zone,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but you have the job and I believe the Lord can help you. You need to think about the individual. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re here for. Just relax and take it from the students if they are getting it or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ha, I thought, maybe that&#8217;s easy for you to do; I really don&#8217;t fit the job. But I had to agree that she had a point. Could I profess to rely on God for teaching and limit Him in this matter, by my doubts? By clinging to &#8220;my comfort zone&#8221;? This was a new aspect to consider.</p>

<p>I had never thought seriously about a comfort zone being bad. In fact, I argued that I wasn&#8217;t really suited to a position in which I wasn&#8217;t good or comfortable. Oh, I knew that had some limitations. Teaching itself was something that both fitted me and filled me with an overwhelming sense of need. No, I couldn&#8217;t do it without the Lord&#8217;s help any day. But, well, it was just more down my line to work one-on-one. I couldn&#8217;t be effective if I had to manage more than three or four students, could I?</p>

<p>But this school with the Meek and Lowly One was taking me farther than I had anticipated. The still, small voice was pointing out a way that was untried and steep, and it said
<span class="scripture">&#8220;This is the way, walk ye in it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+30%3A21" title="Isaiah 30:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 30:21)</span></a></span>
Would I rise to the challenge? I weighed Jesus&#8217; might and ability for my weak and dreading heart, and found myself lacking. &#8220;My Comfort Zone&#8221; was in a losing fight. As I realized, its supposed importance was really nothing more than my natural tendency&#8217;s plea for support, so I handed it over to the Master.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready for the next step up,&#8221; I said, and it seemed I could see myself as a student before Him. Was I the student I would want to teach? &#8220;If You think I&#8217;m ready for higher course material, why should I balk at the extra work? I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s just what I need,&#8221; I said. It is every teacher&#8217;s heartbreak to see a child who refuses to learn, and I didn&#8217;t want to be one.</p>

<p>A picture of Jesus standing on the crowded Galilean hillside came to my mind. My Master had often been the focus of hundreds of eyes. Would I have seen Him pass me by with a hurried glance and &#8220;teach the lesson,&#8221; or would He be speaking directly to me, in my need? Oh, personal experience talks! And how much I knew I needed to learn from Him. It ashamed me to think I had resisted this call of Love itself. Now old &#8220;comfort zone&#8221; seemed a new foe; a point of danger. Can it be otherwise to a soul that has given their heart to Jesus?</p>

<p>The application of the new lesson wasn&#8217;t nearly so hard as I had imagined. The Lord gave me the key as I began my week:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;faith which worketh by love,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+5%3A6" title="Galatians 5:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 5:6)</span></a></span>
which said to me, &#8220;If you do it out of Love to Me, don&#8217;t you believe I&#8217;m there to help you each step of the way?&#8221; He could, and He did. As I set out to love each face in that long row of seven precious children, the panicky feeling flew away. It was no long &#8220;teaching the lesson&#8221; (desperately, quickly, efficiently), but, &#8220;I have something to help you.&#8221; The &#8220;you&#8221; was my new focus. And an absolutely necessary one, I knew without a doubt. Teacher was right.</p>

<p>As I look back one week in the lesson, I&#8217;m prepared to learn more. How often the Lord would change our own reasoning around and give us His thoughts. I can&#8217;t think of &#8220;comfort zones&#8221; in the same way now. Not that my feelings don&#8217;t cozy up to them just as before, but my eyes are opened. It is as Jesus said,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+15%3A3" title="Matthew 15:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 15:3)</span></a></span>
My tradition, too, had gotten in the way. How many other &#8220;pet ideas&#8221; and instilled attitudes about life will I have to cut down and hand over to my Master? Probably many, but I am willing. &#8220;He knows His stuff,&#8221; as some would say. And that &#8220;stuff&#8221; is taking me where I want to be&#8212;at home with Him on high.</p>

<h1>Just Mary: Part 1</h1>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">A young uncle who had no use for &#8220;girl babies&#8221; and a little baby girl who wins his heart make a setting for the dealings of God in both their lives. We hope you will find this abridged biography to be a blessing to you.</p>
</div>


<hr class="minor" />
<p>Mother Harmon glanced at the postmark on the letter which the delivery man left in her mail box, and then hastily breaking the seal, she drew a few sheets of folded paper from the envelope and began to read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noindent first">My Own Dear Mother:</p>

<p>I just had to write to you so that your anxiety will be relieved, for I know that you have been very anxious for the past few days. I can now tell you that it is all over, and we have a lovely little daughter which was born yesterday afternoon. When we decided on a name we thought of you and of Mother Dennison, and could decide on no better name than the name you both have, so we call her Mary. Just Mary. We thought there was no other name to go with it that is suited to our baby, since she has the name of both of her grandmothers, so she is just Mary Dennison.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Mother Harmon donned a big sunbonnet, and with letter in hand started down the lane toward the field where a man and two boys were plowing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Elsie&#8217;s baby is a girl,&#8221; said she as she lifted the letter in her hand and then handed it to Father Harmon, &#8220;and they have named her Mary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I am glad,&#8221; Father Harmon said as he folded the letter. &#8220;And I was almost sure that they would name her Mary should the baby be a girl, but I think I could have found a name to go with it. Ann, Jane, Elizabeth, Lou, or Susan&#8212;any of them would sound good with Mary, and they could have called her by both names.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this time the two boys had come over and Mother Harmon announced, &#8220;Elsie has a little girl baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Father Harmon, &#8220;you are Uncle Roy and Uncle Dave now, and you have a little niece whose name is Mary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hmph,&#8221; said the younger of the two, who was Roy, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see why it couldn&#8217;t have been a boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The principal reason why it could not be a boy is because it is a girl,&#8221; laughingly replied Father Harmon, &#8220;and I think that is reason enough, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy had no reply to make, but Dave said, &#8220;I do not know as it makes much difference to me which it is, but it seems like I am getting old, to be called Uncle Dave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t expect her to call you Uncle Dave for a few days yet,&#8221; retorted Roy, and he turned to go back to his plow.</p>

<p>It was late in the summer when another letter came from Elsie. She was coming home again, bringing little Mary that the grandparents might see her darling. Ever since Mary had come into the Dennison home, Elsie&#8217;s letters had been full of what a wonderful baby she had. David and Roy would say, &#8220;Why can&#8217;t she tell us something else besides, &#8216;Baby, baby&#8217; all the time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just wait until you boys see her baby and you may not wonder at her writing so much about it,&#8221; replied Father Harmon. &#8220;I am guessing that each of you will think the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I,&#8221; retorted Roy. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think girl babies are so wonderful. I do not see why it could not have been a boy anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when the hour for leaving to pick up Elsie arrived, Father and Mother Harmon found two boys eager to go along. It took some time to persuade them to remain at home, but when Father Harmon told Roy that he might go along if he would hold Elsie&#8217;s baby on his lap on the return home, that settled the question, and he was willing to remain at home. So Father and Mother Harmon climbed into the carriage, leaving the boys at home to attend to some chores which must be done.</p>

<p>As the sun began to sink below the western horizon two boys sat on the gatepost with their faces turned toward Whitefield watching for the approach of the team. At last they heard the buggy wheels and ran to open the gate which led into the barn lot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, David; hello, Roy,&#8221; said Elsie as the carriage passed through the gate. &#8220;My, my, I never thought to find you boys so big. You have grown so much the last year!&#8221; She jumped down and gave each of them a big bear hug. &#8220;But come on, boys, I want to show you little Mary. Do you not want to see her?&#8221; And she reached out and took the little bundle from Mother Harmon&#8217;s arms.</p>

<p>David looked at baby and to the inquiry of Elsie, &#8220;What do you think about her?&#8221; replied, &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you what I think about her yet; you will have to wait until she begins to cry and then I can tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Roy could not be persuaded even to take a peep at the little baby face. Elsie took it all as a great joke, and they went into the house together. As Elsie laid the bundle of white cap, dress, and pink bootees on the bed, little Mary opened her eyes and began to look about her, as if to say, &#8220;Where am I?&#8221; Elsie began to talk to her, and soon a smile spread over the little baby face which went straight to David&#8217;s heart. When Elsie removed her cap he exclaimed, &#8220;Look at that curly hair!&#8221; But no amount of persuasion could induce Roy even to take a peep at her all that evening.</p>

<p>The next morning after being dressed little Mary found her thumb and began to suck it. Roy had stood in the doorway watching her, and when little Mary found her thumb he burst into a big laugh and before exclaimed, &#8220;Mama, look at that baby go after her thumb; isn&#8217;t that cute?&#8221; His face turned scarlet as all the others began to laugh, but he still lingered near the bed. &#8220;Mama,&#8221; he said that evening, &#8220;Elsie has got a cute baby, hasn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>All of them tried to find a name suited to her other than Mary. Mother Harmon called her little Dumpling; David called her Curly, because of her curly hair; Father Harmon called her Sunshine because she was always smiling. &#8220;I know what I shall call the baby,&#8221; Roy said at last. &#8220;Her name is Peachy, because she is sweet as a peach.&#8221; And that is what they called her ever after.</p>

<p>When the time came for Elsie to be taken to the station for her return home, Roy needed no persuading to hold the baby on his lap on the trip to the station, for he was reluctant to turn her loose. When the train pulled out from the station taking Elsie and little Mary back to their own home, he laid his head on his mother&#8217;s shoulder and sobbed as only a twelve-year-old boy can sob. Peachy had won Roy&#8217;s heart.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Each year Elsie made two visits to her parents, and each time all could see how rapidly Mary was growing and learning. In her third year she could talk plainly and ask so many questions that it kept the Harmon family busy trying to answer them. Though the others might send her away, Uncle Roy never tired regardless of how many questions were asked nor how fast they came.</p>

<p>Peachy was Roy&#8217;s favored pet, and all could see that Uncle Roy was the chosen one for her. She was with him when he went to attend to some chores about the barn, or when he went to the field to bring up the stock to water, and ride back with him on old Fan. It seemed while she was with them, he had no other thought than to find some way to amuse her. This was a great relief to both Mother and Grandmother, for Peachy was ever trying to satisfy her curiosity, and often this led her into places where baby hands and fingers should not be found.</p>

<p>But all things must come to an end sometime, and so did Peachy&#8217;s visit with Uncle Roy come to an end, and Elsie returned to her home again, leaving Roy in tears as he said, &#8220;Good-by&#8221; to his little Peachy at the station. Elsie promised to be with them during Christmas. He looked forward to that time with all his heart. Every spare piece of money he could get was laid away that he might get something for little Peachy, that there might be something nice for her to find in her stocking on Christmas morning.</p>

<p>Roy could talk of nothing else. Among the toys which he selected for her was a set of building blocks which contained all the letters of the alphabet together with the picture of a number of animals and their names. When asked why he had selected these, he said, &#8220;Peachy is so quick to learn anything that I wanted to teach her the letters on those blocks while they are here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The long-expected letter came at last, but what disappointment and anxiety it brought with it, for it stated that Peachy was very sick of a fever, and they could not come and would not feel safe to take her from home for the remainder of the winter, so they need not expect a visit from them now until they felt it would be safe to take their little darling away from home.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know this is a great disappointment,&#8221; Mother Harmon said as she saw Roy&#8217;s dismal face. &#8220;But it is all for the best, I am sure. I would not want her to come now with the baby sick, for I fear it would only make her worse, and I want her to take care of our little Peachy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy nodded his head and walked away, but there was a sad, disappointed look in his eyes as he appeared at the dinner table, and he had no appetite.</p>

<p>Mother Harmon looked at her two sons as they sat there before her. David, her happy-go-lucky boy who never took anything seriously, was of strong, muscular build like his father. He was a good mixer and could go with any crowd and had many friends, but he was the source of much anxiety on the part of his mother, for he was easily persuaded by his associates.</p>

<p>Roy, on the other hand, was light-haired and blue-eyed. He was a slender, tender-hearted boy, so quick to love and so quick to hate. No one could persuade him unless he had confidence in them and loved them. And when he loved them, their burdens became his also, for he took them into his own life. He was very reserved and therefore had few associates. Mother Harmon could see her boys as they were and loved them for what they were.</p>

<p>After supper they began to pack presents for Elsie and her family. Roy went to the buggy shed, and when he returned to the house was carrying under his arm a package which he had purchased in town that day. Mother Harmon unwrapped it to find a lovely dressed doll with real hair and eyes that would open and shut.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, son, why did you get such a good doll for her?&#8221; exclaimed Mother Harmon. &#8220;I fear it will last no time and she will just break it right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is not anything too good for my Peachy girl,&#8221; said Roy, &#8220;and I wish that I might see her when they give it to her.&#8221; When the last thing was packed David returned to his work, but Roy took the box into town and mailed it at the post office in Whitefield.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Christmas morning dawned, and Uncle Rufus and his family arrived in the old bobsled.</p>

<p>When dinner was called and the two Harmon families sat down to the table, Father Harmon bowed his head to offer thanks for the food before them and ask the blessings of God upon it. &#8220;Bless, also, the absent ones from among us today,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;and may they be as well supplied with the good things of life as we are, and may their every need be supplied.&#8221; Mother Harmon was seated next to Roy at the table; as her husband repeated these words she heard Roy take a short breath, and at her husband&#8217;s &#8220;amen,&#8221; she looked at her youngest son and saw his face get pale and his eyelids bat quickly as if to check tears which wanted to start. She saw also the trembling of the lips; yes, Mother saw and understood. Long before any other of the family had finished, Roy excused himself, put on cap and muffler, and started toward the barn. Climbing the ladder to the hay mow, he threw himself face downward and there burst into tears. Unmindful of the cold he lay there for some time until he had wept out the tears that had been held back for a number of days; then he rose, descended the ladder, washed his face with snow and dried it on the back of his knitted mittens, and started for the house.</p>

<p>The others arose from the table, and the women folk began to clear away the dishes and wash them. When about half finished, they heard a loud call from the back of the yard; they looked out and saw Roy rolling a huge ball of snow across the yard.</p>

<p>&#8220;A snow man,&#8221; exclaimed Henry as he hastily donned mittens and cap; &#8220;come on, David, let us help him.&#8221; And out the door he went on the run. The girls were soon wrapped in coats, hoods, and scarves, and even little three-year-old Danny went out to see the sport of building a snow man. When completed they called to Mother Harmon and Aunt Susan to see what they had done.</p>

<p>As the women stepped to the back porch, Roy walked to where they were standing and called out merrily, &#8220;What do you think of it, Aunt Susan?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Susan laughingly replied, &#8220;It looks almost like a real man, doesn&#8217;t it? You boys have certainly done well, for that is about the best snow man I have ever seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy seemed very much pleased, and stepping to his mother&#8217;s side, said in a low tone, &#8220;I wish Peachy could see it; don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother Harmon laid her arm about her son&#8217;s shoulder, pulled him to her and said, &#8220;Yes, son, I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something about her voice as she spoke to him that caused him to look up into her face, and he saw something in her eyes which drew him to her as never before, for he now knew that although he might be laughed at and ridiculed by others, Mother understood. Yes, Mother did understand her boy, and she knew what a battle was being fought that he might hide his disappointment and try to enjoy the Christmas festivities with the others. Yes, she understood, and in the pat of her hand, the glance of her eye, and the tone of her voice, she tried to carry the message to her young son, &#8220;Mother understands.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Roy waited anxiously to hear from Elsie after sending the gift package, and a few days after Christmas a letter came telling them how much the package was appreciated, but Elsie closed her letter by saying, &#8220;I thought surely little Mary would love the doll Roy sent her more than anything else, but she lays it aside to play with her blocks. I never saw a child enjoy anything so much as she does those blocks, and she plays with them by the hour. It is surprising to see how she is learning the letters, too. She knows quite a few of them, and I think in a short time she will know all of them. She says, &#8216;Tell Untle Woy thanks for the pitty blocks.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<p>In March came another letter saying, &#8220;Mother, you would be surprised to hear how Mary can spell. She has learned all those letters on the blocks Roy sent her for Christmas and can now spell all the little words on them and can put them together. You do not know what a time I am having, for I have to keep her in the house all the time and she must have something to entertain her, and I am certainly kept busy for there is no end to her desire to learn, and what is so remarkable about it is that she remembers what I tell her so well. I do not think it will be long until she will be reading. If I could get away to get her a book I should do so, but yet, I think she is doing well as she is. I give her pencil and paper, and she lies on her stomach on the floor for an hour at a time making letters.&#8221;</p>

<p>All these things were talked over by mother and son. When Roy returned from town the following Saturday afternoon after receiving Elsie&#8217;s letter he opened a package containing a Primer, some paper and pencils, some chalk, and a small blackboard. These were sent to Peachy the following week.</p>

<p>After more than a two weeks&#8217; wait he was rewarded for there was not only a letter from Elsie, but little Mary had also sent a printed letter to Uncle Roy, thanking him for the pretty book, the pencils and paper, the chalk and blackboard, and telling him that she was learning to write. This was all printed, and some of the letters were large, and some small, running up and down the lines, but they meant much to the big boy who loved this little girl so much.</p>

<p>But another disappointment was awaiting him, for as much as he had planned on having Peachy with him that summer, in April came a letter from Elsie stating that it would be impossible for her to visit them that summer. Roy was too disappointed to hide the tears, and laying his head over on Mother&#8217;s shoulder, the two of them wept out their disappointment together.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just feel like starting out and hoofing it there, getting that little Peachy and bringing her right back with me,&#8221; said Roy rather indignantly. Mother noticed the indignant ring in his voice and, sitting down with him beside her, she there told him that his future life depended a great deal on conquering self in his early youth, and that he could make this disappointment make a man out of him, or could harbor his disappointment, feeling that he had been badly abused and thereby cultivate a sullen, morbid disposition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those who accomplish anything in this world are those who rise above their disappointments and seek to help others,&#8221; said she as she gave him an affectionate pat on the shoulder. &#8220;I know that my boy is greatly disappointed, but no more so than I am; but now what shall we do? I mean to try to help you by making things pleasant for you and bring something else in your life to cover this disappointment in a measure, and now what are you going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy looked down at the floor where he was sitting for some time and then, lifting his head, he gave his Mother that knowing look as he said, &#8220;I understand, Mother, and I shall forget my own disappointment and try to cover yours in some way,&#8221; and this he did. There was not any little act of kindness which he did not perform for her. He had always been a very tender, affectionate child, but he became more tender and Mother, noticing each little attention, tried in every way that she could to do something for her boy to help him to overcome in this disappointment in his life. Roy would whistle as he went about his work at the house or barn or in the field, and often when his Mother denied herself something that she might do for her boy, Roy would whistle or sing the louder as he would say, &#8220;Mother understands.&#8221; Then there would be something for him to do that he might repay his Mother for the little sacrifice which she had made for him. In this way Roy soon overcame his own disappointment, and in after years looked back on this as an experience which helped him to be an overcomer in later life.</p>
