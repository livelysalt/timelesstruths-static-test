<h1>Danger in the Comfort Zone</h1>

<p>&#8220;I just wanted to talk to you about that class situation&#8212;to get your perspective on it,&#8221; my co-teacher stated. She had taken me out for lunch &#8220;to get away from the school for awhile.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sighed inwardly, trying to rethink my arguments. &#8220;Well, I just don&#8217;t see how I can work that new student in. It&#8217;s hard enough to handle the group and take an interest in each one.&#8221; I could envision myself trying to keep pace with that long row of children facing me each morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need to learn to read them. To be spontaneous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not spontaneous. I can&#8217;t think unless I&#8217;m organized,&#8221; I almost pleaded. As I reconstructed in my mind that feeling of near panic, a new insight came to me. &#8220;It&#8217;s just the way I feel when I&#8217;m in any large group,&#8221; I tried to explain. &#8220;When I&#8217;m in grocery stores I never notice people around me. I shut everyone out and just focus on getting the job done. And that&#8217;s the way it is when I work with a larger class.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it is out of your comfort zone,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but you have the job and I believe the Lord can help you. You need to think about the individual. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re here for. Just relax and take it from the students if they are getting it or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ha, I thought, maybe that&#8217;s easy for you to do; I really don&#8217;t fit the job. But I had to agree that she had a point. Could I profess to rely on God for teaching and limit Him in this matter, by my doubts? By clinging to &#8220;my comfort zone&#8221;? This was a new aspect to consider.</p>

<p>I had never thought seriously about a comfort zone being bad. In fact, I argued that I wasn&#8217;t really suited to a position in which I wasn&#8217;t good or comfortable. Oh, I knew that had some limitations. Teaching itself was something that both fitted me and filled me with an overwhelming sense of need. No, I couldn&#8217;t do it without the Lord&#8217;s help any day. But, well, it was just more down my line to work one-on-one. I couldn&#8217;t be effective if I had to manage more than three or four students, could I?</p>

<p>But this school with the Meek and Lowly One was taking me farther than I had anticipated. The still, small voice was pointing out a way that was untried and steep, and it said
<span class="scripture">&#8220;This is the way, walk ye in it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+30%3A21" title="Isaiah 30:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 30:21)</span></a></span>
Would I rise to the challenge? I weighed Jesus&#8217; might and ability for my weak and dreading heart, and found myself lacking. &#8220;My Comfort Zone&#8221; was in a losing fight. As I realized, its supposed importance was really nothing more than my natural tendency&#8217;s plea for support, so I handed it over to the Master.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready for the next step up,&#8221; I said, and it seemed I could see myself as a student before Him. Was I the student I would want to teach? &#8220;If You think I&#8217;m ready for higher course material, why should I balk at the extra work? I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s just what I need,&#8221; I said. It is every teacher&#8217;s heartbreak to see a child who refuses to learn, and I didn&#8217;t want to be one.</p>

<p>A picture of Jesus standing on the crowded Galilean hillside came to my mind. My Master had often been the focus of hundreds of eyes. Would I have seen Him pass me by with a hurried glance and &#8220;teach the lesson,&#8221; or would He be speaking directly to me, in my need? Oh, personal experience talks! And how much I knew I needed to learn from Him. It ashamed me to think I had resisted this call of Love itself. Now old &#8220;comfort zone&#8221; seemed a new foe; a point of danger. Can it be otherwise to a soul that has given their heart to Jesus?</p>

<p>The application of the new lesson wasn&#8217;t nearly so hard as I had imagined. The Lord gave me the key as I began my week:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;faith which worketh by love,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+5%3A6" title="Galatians 5:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 5:6)</span></a></span>
which said to me, &#8220;If you do it out of Love to Me, don&#8217;t you believe I&#8217;m there to help you each step of the way?&#8221; He could, and He did. As I set out to love each face in that long row of seven precious children, the panicky feeling flew away. It was no long &#8220;teaching the lesson&#8221; (desperately, quickly, efficiently), but, &#8220;I have something to help you.&#8221; The &#8220;you&#8221; was my new focus. And an absolutely necessary one, I knew without a doubt. Teacher was right.</p>

<p>As I look back one week in the lesson, I&#8217;m prepared to learn more. How often the Lord would change our own reasoning around and give us His thoughts. I can&#8217;t think of &#8220;comfort zones&#8221; in the same way now. Not that my feelings don&#8217;t cozy up to them just as before, but my eyes are opened. It is as Jesus said,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+15%3A3" title="Matthew 15:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 15:3)</span></a></span>
My tradition, too, had gotten in the way. How many other &#8220;pet ideas&#8221; and instilled attitudes about life will I have to cut down and hand over to my Master? Probably many, but I am willing. &#8220;He knows His stuff,&#8221; as some would say. And that &#8220;stuff&#8221; is taking me where I want to be&#8212;at home with Him on high.</p>
