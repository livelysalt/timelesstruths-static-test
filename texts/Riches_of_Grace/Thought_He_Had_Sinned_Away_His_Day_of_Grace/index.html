<h1>Thought He Had Sinned Away His Day of Grace</h1>

<p>The enemy of souls has laid many plans and has many devices to deceive people and harass their minds and thereby cause them to bring unnecessarily heavy burdens upon themselves. One of his common impositions is to make a person think that he has committed the unpardonable sin and that all hope of ever obtaining favor with God again is forever gone. When such persons are told that they are laboring under a delusion, and that there is hope for them; that others have felt the same way and formed the same conclusion, but afterwards learned that it was only a deception of the enemy, and were able to renounce the delusion and obtain a good experience and keep it, the answer in most cases is, &#8220;My case is different.&#8221; &#8220;Had I taken advantage of past opportunities when I had a chance to do so, I might have been saved, but now it is too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>Time after time I have labored with those who were sure that their cases were &#8220;different&#8221; from that of anyone else, and that hope was beyond their reach. The situation and feelings seemed so real that no amount of reasoning or evidence to the contrary could change their minds until they became submissive enough to submit themselves to the mercy of God and accept advice and counsel and act upon it. Then they were very soon liberated from the oppressions of the enemy and set free by the grace of God.</p>

<p>One laboring under a deception frequently undergoes as deep suffering of mind and soul as if the situation and conditions were real. A lady once received what was supposed to be an authentic report that her son had been killed in a railway wreck. Circumstances were such that she could receive no communication from him, which apparently added evidence to the truthfulness of the story. Her mother-heart was griefstricken. In the anguish of her bereavement she refused to be comforted. Later she was told that there was a possibility of his having escaped death, that he was probably yet alive, and that evidence had been received to that effect. No, her feelings were too real, her grief was too great, for her to be deceived, she declared. One day her son arrived home sound and well, and did not even know that there had been a trainwreck at the place whence the report came. The mother then found that her sorrow and grief had been groundless. She accepted the status of affairs, cast aside the false report and her bad feelings, and was happy.</p>

<p>Not long ago I met an old acquaintance, a man above seventy years of age, whom I had not seen for many years. At the time of our former meeting he was enjoying the blessings of a Christian experience and was happy in the service of the Lord. Through devotional neglect, and perhaps for other reasons, he began to entertain doubts concerning his spiritual experience, and he questioned whether or not he had any right, under the circumstances, to lay claim to Christian fellowship with those whom he knew to be spiritual. He knew of nothing sinful that he had done, and he needed not to waver in faith. But the tempter was there to suggest that he had lost his experience and might just as well give up the struggle. He then concluded that the brethren did not have confidence in him, and therefore he dropped his profession.</p>

<p>His heart was still tender, and he did not feel disposed to indulge in sin. In a short time he made &#8220;another start&#8221; to serve the Lord and tried to repent; but, having so little to repent over, and finding it difficult to have the same earnestness as before, he claimed the victory &#8220;by faith,&#8221; but was soon in &#8220;doubting castle&#8221; again. These up-and-down experiences continued for many months, during which his spiritual realm was more down than up. Discouragement laid hold upon him, despair followed hard on his track, and the enemy whispered that it was of no use to try any more. The way began to be more and more dreary. Occasionally, however, he was seized with a feeling of desperation to break loose from the state of lethargy into which he had fallen, but alas! his victories were of short duration. These experiences were followed by the accusations of the enemy that he was possessed with devils. Brethren who prayed with him declared that such was not the case.</p>

<p>The darkest scriptures of judgment and everlasting destruction seemed to have been written for him, and, as he viewed the matter, they exactly fitted his case. He had doubted so often when it seemed the Lord was offering a helping hand, that now it was too late; the last cord was severed, the last ray of hope had vanished. It was no difficult matter to believe that he had committed the unpardonable sin, and that God had forever hid His face from him. He resigned himself to the hopelessness of the situation, to meet his fate at the end of his life here upon earth and spend eternity in the regions of the lost. He spent a number of years in this condition.</p>

<p>At the time of our recent visit in a private home, I felt much concerned about his deliverance from such a state and condition. Upon my approaching him on the subject, he immediately informed me that it was useless to waste any of my efforts on him, for his was a hopeless case, as he had sinned against the Holy Ghost. Having met similar cases before, I assured him that there was hope for him, and told him that I could prove by the Word of God and by his own testimony that he had not committed the crime that would cause him to be forever lost, as he had supposed.</p>

<p>Taking my Bible, I turned to <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A29">Hebrews 10:29</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?&#8221;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Have you trodden under foot the Son of God as herein mentioned?&#8221; he was then asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied; &#8220;I have never doubted that there is a God nor that Jesus Christ is His Son.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you <span class="scripture">&#8216;counted the blood of the covenant an unholy thing,&#8217;</span> that is, that there is no more virtue in the blood of Jesus Christ than there is in the blood of a cow or some other unholy thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir. I have never denied the power of the blood of Jesus nor <span class="scripture">&#8216;done despite to the Spirit of grace,&#8217;</span>&nbsp;&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, according to the Bible and your own testimony, you have not blasphemed against the Holy Ghost, nor, as you say, committed the unpardonable sin by sinning against the Holy Ghost. You must forever cease to entertain the idea that you have committed such a sin.&#8221;</p>

<p>He reluctantly admitted the truth in regard to that point, but said, &#8220;There is such a thing as a man&#8217;s going too far, of trifling so with God that the Spirit of God will no longer strive with him.&#8221; It was clearly pointed out to him that he had never reached such an experience and that he should cast aside his doubts and fears and call upon God, and was assured that the Lord would save him. He then declared that he had no will of his own, no power to exercise his will if he had any, and was helpless. I told him that anyone who could read human nature would at once conclude that he was a man of strong willpower, and that no doubt he frequently made others aware of that fact.</p>

<p>His wife said, &#8220;That is true; he knows very well how to exercise his willpower.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was then told to assert his manhood and take a decided stand.</p>

<p>But he replied, &#8220;I have no manhood; I have no power to assert myself in any way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;you have been in this town for the past few days, and have asserted your manhood during your entire visit by acting the part of a perfect gentleman. What you need to do now is to kneel with us here in prayer and yield yourself to God, and He will save you the same as He has saved others who thought they were beyond the reach of mercy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But my case is different; my heart is hardened like stone; I cannot pray; I have no feeling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Almost everyone in your condition thinks his case is different. If you act according to the instructions given, you will soon be different. Your heart will be changed. Do your part in making the effort, and the Lord will help you to pray, and you will have all the feeling necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>We knelt in prayer, laid our hands upon his head, and with a fervent prayer rebuked the deceptive and binding power of Satan, and asked the Lord to save him. He made an effort to pray, but his few words were soon mingled with his sobs and feelings of deepest contrition. A few minutes later he arose praising God for salvation. His doubts and fears had vanished, and his burden was gone. He was once more a free man and had no more fears of death and the judgment. The next day he returned home with a joyful heart. I have frequently heard from him since that time, and he has always sent a message concerning his victorious life.</p>

<p>There are many others who have been harassed by the enemy in like manner; who have lost all hope of recovering their favorwith God; who think that they are &#8220;different,&#8221; &#8220;hard-hearted,&#8221; &#8220;hopeless,&#8221; &#8220;have sinned away the day of grace,&#8221; &#8220;are under the control of Satan,&#8221; or in some such like condition. Yet God in His love is extending mercy and only waiting for them to discard their deceptive ideas and accept His grace.</p>
