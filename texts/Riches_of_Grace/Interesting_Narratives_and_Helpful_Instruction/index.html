<h1>Interesting Narratives and Helpful Instruction</h1>

<p>Success and happiness in the Christian life do not always depend upon favorable surroundings; under the most adverse and trying circumstances men and women have made the greatest strides in spiritual advancement and power. There may be occasional sorrows and suffering along the way, but shall these things cast a gloom over our lives, even though at times they be prolonged and severe? By no means should we allow opposition, persecution, sorrow, suffering, mistakes, blunders, failures, and such like to cause defeat and a giving way to discouragement. The discouraged person is &#8220;no good,&#8221; no matter where you find him. We must rise in the midst of our trials and in the name and strength of the Lord shake off discouragements.</p>

<p>Trials will come, but what of it? Others have had just as severe trials, and have surmounted them, and you and I can do the same. There will be times when oppressions will be felt that seem grievous to bear; when even the humble followers of Christ will feel that the lines of communication between them and the Lord have been severed; when prayers will seem to fall to the earth and the heavens seem as brass, and the burdened soul will cry out for help when there seems to be no help. At such times there needs to be a patient waiting upon the Lord, heart-searching, and humble submission to His will. Under such circumstances it is well to heed the advice of the Psalmist: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Commit thy way unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+37%3A5" title="Psalm 37:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 37:5)</span></a></span> Then is the time to trust and not be afraid.</p>

<p>It was at such a time that Jesus felt that His burden was more than he could bear and asked that, if possible, the cup of suffering be removed, that He might not have to pass through the severe ordeal that was facing Him. His humanity weakened and shuddered at the approach of the greatest trial of his life. But He humbly submitted and said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Father&#8230;&#8203;not my will, but thine, be done.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+22%3A42" title="Luke 22:42"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 22:42)</span></a></span> It was then that angels came and ministered unto Him; the gates of glory were thrown open, the burden was gone, and He could go forth as a captive set free.</p>

<p>As he left that place of prayer, that place of victory, it was to face the foe in the hottest of the fight. Although He was upheld by the unseen presence of the Father and strengthened by the angels, nevertheless in the darkest hour of the conflict He cried out, <span class="scripture">&#8220;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+27%3A46%3B+Mark+15%3A34" title="Matthew 27:46; Mark 15:34"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 27:46; Mark 15:34)</span></a></span> But even in this final test He said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+23%3A46" title="Luke 23:46"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 23:46)</span></a></span> This was followed by the unprecedented glories of the resurrection. What a wonderful lesson to us of submission and trust!</p>

<h2>Failed to Forgive Those Who Had Wronged Him</h2>
<p>An unforgiving disposition will hinder one from being humble or from reaching the necessary point of submission. When Stephen was being stoned by his persecutors, his dying prayer was, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+7%3A60" title="Acts 7:60"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 7:60)</span></a></span></p>

<p>One Sunday when I was conducting an inquiry service in a state prison, after I had commented on these words of Jesus, <span class="scripture">&#8220;If ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+6%3A15" title="Matthew 6:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 6:15)</span></a></span> a prisoner arose and said, &#8220;For years I have sought the Lord, but never before have I known what hindered me from obtaining peace to my soul. But now I see it is because I have held a grudge against those who have wronged me. I forgive them.&#8221; Peace came into his soul as he yielded this point.</p>

<h2>Despondency and Discouragement</h2>
<p>Instead of counting your trials and indulging in dark forebodings, throw away such feelings by counting your past blessings if you can think of no present blessings. When Paul and Silas were in prison with their feet fastened in the stocks, the pain in their lacerated backs no doubt often reminded them of the cruel treatment they had received at the hands of their enemies; but they looked away from their trials, and, counting all things joy, at the midnight hour they were rejoicing, singing songs, and praising God. The result was marvelous. Had they set themselves to complaining, they would have spent a miserable night.</p>

<p>A sister was once just at the point of throwing down her shield of faith and ceasing her efforts in serving the Lord, because of some difficulty which had arisen between her husband and one of the brethren, and in which in a sense she also was involved. She had always entertained implicit confidence in the brother, but now said she could never have confidence in him again. Had it been some worldly person, she could have overlooked the matter, but to have one of the brethren make such statements was more than she could endure. However, she relented, and before she could gain the necessary victory, she had to make a decision to stand true to God regardless of the source of the trial.</p>

<p>At this point is where many fail, not because the trial is greater than some other through which they have passed, but because it comes from an entirely unexpected source.</p>

<h2>Unnecessary Self-Accusations</h2>
<p>A woman and her husband who were ministers were once drawn into a difficulty with others and had to call for aid in making an adjustment. When the time came for a consideration of the matter, she humbly and nobly did her part, to the satisfaction of all concerned. Although there was nothing demoralizing about the case, yet she felt very humiliated to think that she, a minister, should have thus become involved in such a contention, and thought that the brother who was called to help in the adjustment would never have confidence in her again. For four years she worried over the matter, often losing sleep at night, and felt herself gradually weakening in spirituality and courage.</p>

<p>One day she met the brother, and he expressed himself as having had implicit confidence in her during the entire period of the four years. Immediately she took courage, but she had needlessly undergone untold sufferings through accusations that were all imaginary. Worrying does no one any good. It is useless to worry before a thing happens, much less after it happens. Most people worry over imaginary things, over things that never have nor never will come to pass.</p>

<p>A sister who had lived a godly life and had prayed for her family for years, became much troubled because none of them would become Christians. She began to accuse herself of not being right in the sight of God, but she was reminded that even Jesus Himself, although He was the Son of God, was not able to have all His kinsmen and townsmen to follow Him. She then learned to leave the responsibility with her family and the Lord after she had done all she could, realizing that her soul was clear.</p>

<h2>Troubled About Making Confessions</h2>
<p>One woman was troubled over her past life, feeling that she should make a public confession, which would endanger the lives of others. She said it seemed that God was far away from her. Upon investigation it was learned that her trouble was of such a nature that it would do her or nobody else any good to make such a confession, but was a matter that could be settled only between herself and God. Not until she learned this could she have peace of mind and reach the place where she could find deliverance.</p>

<p>A woman who had been an actress was married to a respectable young man in Ohio. Their home was an ideal one in the country. Three children graced their domestic circle, and there was apparently nothing to mar the happiness of their Christian home. One day the wife and eldest daughter went to visit the pastor who had for years been their spiritual advisor. He expressed his congratulations to her for her attainments in life, pleasant surroundings, and the extraordinary abilities of her children.</p>

<p>Just before leaving the house of the pastor, she requested a private interview with him. When alone with him she said, &#8220;Judging from outward appearances, you have believed me to be a very happy woman. But for many years my heart has been sad, and I have constantly carried a heavy burden. Sometimes it seemed to be more than I could bear. Before my marriage I was allured into sin of a disgraceful nature, but my husband believed me to have always maintained an irreproachable character, and I have never told him otherwise. Since our marriage I have always been true to him. Many times during these years I have been just at the point of unburdening my heart by revealing to him this secret and placing myself at his mercy; but somehow I have always been checked or prevented from doing so. I have carried the heavy burden until I can carry it no longer. Please tell me what to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wise old pastor, with deep feelings of compassion, said: &#8220;Good woman, you have carried an unnecessary burden all these years. Your husband knew nothing of your sin; it will do him no good to know of it now, but, on the other hand, a knowledge of it might bring an unnecessary burden upon him, and cause his implicit confidence to give place to suspicion. Why should you thus bring feelings of reproach upon yourself and family? They are a thousand times better off without a knowledge of it. Go bury it in oblivion; cast it from your mind forever. God has forgiven you long ago. Such matters are to be settled between you and Him alone; go and sin no more.&#8221; She obeyed and went forth a happy woman. Her burden was gone.</p>

<p>If all spiritual advisors were as wise as this pastor in giving instruction to those in need of help, much suffering would be averted. There are thousands of people today carrying heavy burdens that God has not placed upon them, but has long ago forgiven because of their repentance. Such persons have allowed the enemy of their souls to unnecessarily burden them with accusations and false impressions. These they should have cast aside, declaring their freedom in the name of Jesus.</p>

<h2>Accused God of Not Being Just</h2>
<p>There are others who accuse God of not being just, or blame Him for not answering their prayers, when the fact is, their lives have not been such as would give them an assurance that God would answer their prayers. A young sister who had for sometime been drifting into worldliness was called to the bedside of her dying father. She was much concerned about him and asked a special favor of the Lord concerning him, and because her request was not granted in just the manner requested, she permitted her mind to be filled with doubts and infidelity. She blamed God for not answering, and then she began to have struggles with hardness of heart, which she had never known before. This caused her to become alarmed, and she sought the counsel of a minister. He cited her to <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+3%3A22">I&nbsp;John 3:22</a>&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;And whatsoever we ask we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.&#8221;</span> She acknowledged that she had not been living right, and therefore had no right to blame God for not answering her prayers.</p>

<h2>When the Tempter Comes Oftenest</h2>
<p>The tempter comes oftenest where the temptation has not been completely put away and where there is lack of decision against it. Many people are like the drunkard. He desires to cease drinking, but says, &#8220;Just one more drink; then I am done.&#8221; When that has been taken he says, &#8220;One more, only one; then I am forever done with strong drink.&#8221; Such a determination will never loose him from the binding fetters.</p>

<p>The one who is bound by an evil habit or has yielded to the fascinations of an alluring spirit must make a positive, definite decision, in every way possible turn from the temptation, and call upon God for help with a faith that will not waver; then deliverance is sure to come, and grace to be an overcomer.</p>

<h2>Trials Made Steppingstones to Greater Victories</h2>
<p>The beautiful roses are protected by thorns, many of which are hidden away beneath the presentation of beauty. Roses are not often plucked without the one who would enjoy their fragrance realizing a pain by being pricked in an attempt to secure the sweet-scented flower as his own. Just why the thorns are there we do not know. Many a young recruit looks with admiration upon the veteran skill of the soldier who has been through fierce battles and has come forth as a hero. But his fame was not obtained without hardships and wounds, as the scars which he carries give testimony. About us on every side are veterans of the cross of Christ, those whose lives we admire, whose experiences we covet, but back of them no doubt are the pricking thorns in the form of trials, which have proved to be steppingstones to the beautiful life of faith and devotion and which have graced their spiritual pathway. The roses are none the less fragrant and beautiful because of the hidden thorns beneath them. Neither is the life of a Christian less brilliant and radiant because of the trials and temptations along the way.</p>

<p>The enjoyment of a Christian life is what we make it. The darkest, saddest life ever known, the most dejected person in existence, the one who is surrounded constantly by infamy, blasphemy, and dark forebodings, or that one whose life has been a failure and who through adversity is doomed to spend his days behind prison walls, can find a haven of rest in this life and in the life to come. It is through the grace of God that such can be accomplished.</p>

<p>No matter what your sin is or has been, you can have deliverance and peace that the world cannot understand. A firm decision and trust in God will take you through by His grace. When trials come, tell the Lord about them, <span class="scripture">&#8220;casting all your care upon him, for he careth for you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+5%3A7" title="I&nbsp;Peter 5:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 5:7)</span></a></span> Oh, the riches of His grace, the power of His love! There is an abundance in the great storehouse of our heavenly Father subject to our petitions, and He offers His heavenly riches freely and His blessings to be poured out without measure.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+3%3A20-21" title="Ephesians 3:20-21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 3:20-21)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A16" title="Hebrews 4:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 4:16)</span></a></span></p>
