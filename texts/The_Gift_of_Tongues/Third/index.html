<h1>Third</h1>

<p>In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+14%3A21">I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:21</a>, tongues (foreign or national languages) is a prophesy of the gift of foreign languages: <span class="scripture">&#8220;In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.&#8221;</span> On Pentecost, those who would not hear accused the apostles of being drunk and those who would not hear (or believe) were mostly professors, but now on the other hand we will notice some who did hear (or believe). In verse 22, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+14%3A22" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:22)</span></a></span> Now it was prophesied in the law (Old Testament) that God would as a &#8220;sign&#8221; speak to them that believe not (men of other nations and other languages) by giving the speaker the gift of languages of the people spoken to. We find this prophecy was first fulfilled on Pentecost (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+2">Acts 2</a>). Those who spoke in foreign languages were all Galileans, speaking <span class="scripture">&#8220;as the Spirit gave them utterance.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+2%3A4" title="Acts 2:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 2:4)</span></a></span> <i>Utterance</i> from Webster is the act of uttering words&#8212;not in peeping or muttering. On this occasion it was in the languages of sixteen or seventeen nationalities present, perhaps more&#8212;out of <span class="scripture">&#8220;every nation under heaven,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+2%3A5" title="Acts 2:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 2:5)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;every man heard them speak in his own language.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+2%3A6" title="Acts 2:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 2:6)</span></a></span> They were all amazed at this sign, at this wonderful stupenduous event. Now as this is the only place where it is mentioned <span class="scripture">&#8220;the Spirit gave them utterance,&#8221;</span> and this utterance being in real foreign languages of the foreign unhelievers who were present at that time, hearing and understanding all that was said, the gift of interpretation was not given nor needed, as interpretation consists of interpreting from one&#8217;s own language into that of his foreign hearers.</p>

<p>To illustrate, at one time while preaching to a Swedish congregation in Iowa, one of the number could not understand me. Then I called a Swedish brother who could understand me, and I spoke a few sentences, then paused until he could interpret what I said to the unlearned man, and after hearing and understanding, with the tears coursing down his cheeks, he gave vent to his feelings by saying, &#8220;Yah, yah,&#8221; or &#8220;Yes, yes.&#8221; On the other hand, if the gift of tongues (if it were the Swedish tongue) had been bestowed on me, there would have been no need of an interpreter. I see no reason for so much misunderstanding on this point. There was no such manifestation on Pentecost as our modern tongues brethren are preaching and practicing, such as muttering, familiar spirits, clairvoyance, visions, St. Vitus&#8217; dancing, jerking, shaking. There was no sorcery, witchcraft, convulsions or charming enchantment, bewitching, soothsaying, jabbering, no hysteria, no falling down and wallowing on the ground with distorted features. These spirits almost invariably run to the <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=14th+chapter+of+1+Corinthians">14th chapter of I&nbsp;Corinthians</a> for support or foundation for their belief, and endeavor to prove by it that the gift of tongues needs to be interpreted before anyone, including the speaker, can understand. Paul here only lays down regulations for praying, singing or preaching in their own foreign language (or other language) not understood by the congregation, which would make it necessary for an interpreter to interpret from the foreign language used into that of the congregation. <span class="scripture">&#8220;He that speaketh in an unknown tongue [the Emphatic Diaglott says, &#8216;foreign language&#8217;] edifieth himself.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+14%3A4" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:4)</span></a></span> Why? Because he understands his own mother tongue (language), otherwise, he would not be edified. <span class="scripture">&#8220;He that prophesieth edifieth the church.&#8221;</span> Why? Because he speaks in their own language, otherwise they would not be edified.</p>

<p>For further proof of this, read <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+14%3A5%2C7-13">verses 5, and 7 to 13</a>. The Emphatic Diaglott has it thus, &#8220;I am willing indeed for you all to speak in different languages, but rather that you should prophesy&#8221;; for greater is he that prophesies, (Why? Because the congregation understands), than he who speaks in different languages (his own foreign language or any other not understood by the rest), unless interpreted so that the congregation may receive edification. We learn from this also that nobody is edified by hearing a foreigner speak in his own language not understood by the hearer. Of what good would I be to any congregation if I came speaking a language not understood by them? No good, absolutely none at all! It would edify no one&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;Except they give a distinction in the sound, how shall it be known what is piped or harped.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+14%3A17" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:17)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;It may be there are so many kinds of languages in the world, and no one is unmeaning. If then I do not know the meaning of the language, I shall be to the speaker a barbarian, [foreigner], and the speaker will be a barbarian [foreigner] to me&#8221;</span> (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+14%3A10-11">Verses 10 and 11</a>, quoted from Greek). <span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherefore, let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue [&#8216;foreign languages,&#8217; Emphatic] pray that he may interpret&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+14%3A13" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:13)</span></a></span> from his own mother tongue into that of the congregation so they may be edified. For if I pray in a foreign language my spirit (myself, my own understanding) is praying, but my meaning is unintelligible to others (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+14%3A14">I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:14</a>). This is not, in our opinion, the gift of tongues, as it was not given for use in praying to God, but <span class="scripture">&#8220;for a sign&#8230;&#8203;to them that believe not.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+14%3A22" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:22)</span></a></span></p>

<p>We find according to the above named Scriptures that for the space of one hundred years we have record of only three cases of the gift of tongues, and none of interpretation. Why? Because the gift of tongues is a God-given ability to speak in foreign languages, enabling one to speak or preach in the language of his foreign hearers, which needs no interpretation; but speaking in one&#8217;s own language is not the gift of tongues, and should one preach in his own tongue to the unlearned as in the 14th chapter of 1 Corinthians an interpreter would be necessary. Paul says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;I thank my God I speak with tongues more than you all.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+14%3A18" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:18)</span></a></span> This means &#8220;I speak in foreign languages,&#8221; or perhaps, &#8220;in more foreign languages than any of you.&#8221; We have no proof that he did or did not have the gift of tongues, as hundreds received the baptism of the Holy Ghost where there is no mention of tongues, but as he was an apostle of the Gentiles of many different languages, he, no doubt, had use of foreign languages, which he might have learned even before he was saved, as he was a learned man. But as he is not speaking especially of the gift of tongues here in this 14th chapter, but rather of the abuse of what they did have&#8212;whether a gift once bestowed, their own language, or a learned language&#8212;so it is immaterial in this case whether Paul&#8217;s tongues were the gift or learned, as tongues mentioned in the Bible always means languages. So one can readily see there is a difference between the gift of tongues (or languages) and other languages learned by study.</p>

<p>Now let us notice briefly the <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+14%3A21-23">verses 21 through 23</a> of this chapter. <span class="scripture">&#8220;If, therefore, the whole church [universal of many languages] come together into one place and all speak with tongues [&#8216;foreign languages,&#8217; from the Greek], and there comes in those who are unlearned or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad [crazy]?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+14%3A23" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:23)</span></a></span> Why? Because they could not understand the language used. If this is the gift mentioned in verses 21 and 22, and <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+28%3A11+and+12">Isaiah 28:11 and 12</a>, and demonstrated at Pentecost (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+2%3A4">Acts 2:4</a>), they were certainly abusing it instead of using it in the way it was intended as a sign as at Pentecost. For that was understood by every nationality present there that day. This kind mentioned in the 23rd verse makes people who are unlearned <span class="scripture">&#8220;say that ye are mad,&#8221;</span> but that manifested on Pentecost was <span class="scripture">&#8220;for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+14%3A22" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:22)</span></a></span></p>

<p>For proof of this read the Acts 2:6-8: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together [a multitude of all nations of unhelievers] and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language. And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak, Galileans? And how hear we every man in his own tongue wherein we were born?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+2%3A6-8" title="Acts 2:6-8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 2:6-8)</span></a></span> And thus the prophecy was fulfilled according to <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+28%3A11+and+12+and+Joel+2">Isaiah 28:11 and 12 and Joel 2</a>.</p>

<p>And the result of this meeting where the gift of tongues was so wonderfully manifested will be found in the <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+2%3A41">Acts 2:41</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8220;And the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.&#8221;</span> This is the true gift of tongues and was used to convince the unbelievers, while prophesying (or &#8220;preaching,&#8221; from the Greek) is for the believer. It matters not what tongue we speak in, if it is the tongue or language of our hearers we are preaching or prophesying. But if a number of ministers of different tongues or nationalities come together in one place, as at Corinth, and insist on speaking in their own tongue, which the congregation does not understand, they are neither preaching, prophesying, nor speaking with the gift of tongues. As the gift of tongues was always understood by the hearers, as on Pentecost, at Cesarea, and Ephesus, no one is receiving any benefit but themselves, for they are either speaking alone to God or speaking <span class="scripture">&#8220;into the air.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+14%3A9" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:9)</span></a></span></p>
