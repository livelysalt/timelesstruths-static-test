<h1>Rosie&#8217;s Answers</h1>

<p>&#8220;Mama, what does that verse mean?&#8221; Rosie asked as she finished her cereal one morning. She sat looking up at the white paper on the fridge. &#8220; <span class="scripture">&#8216;Ye shall ask what ye will,&#8217;</span>&nbsp;&#8221; she read slowly, &#8220; <span class="scripture">&#8216;and it shall be done unto you.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+15%3A7" title="John 15:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 15:7)</span></a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It means that if you ask God for something, He will do it for you,&#8221; Mom said, looking up from her dishwashing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mom smiled. &#8220;It depends what you are asking for,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The first part of the verse says: <span class="scripture">&#8216;If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you.&#8217;</span> That means, if we are living close to Jesus and doing what He wants us to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I can ask for what I want?&#8221; Rosie asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if we ask in faith believing, He has promised to give it,&#8221; Mom said. She turned back to the kitchen sink and Rosie sat quietly, thinking. <i>I want to please Jesus. He can give me what I ask for. What should I ask for first?</i></p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_35/answers_potato.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="322" /></div>
<p>The back door opened and big-brother Chad appeared. He wore a frown on his face. &#8220;I think a gopher is eating the potatoes we planted,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There are mounds all over the garden and when I dug up the tunnel, look what I found.&#8221; He held up half of a potato. Rosie could see teeth marks on it where the gopher had chewed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you set traps?&#8221; Mom asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but it doesn&#8217;t work,&#8221; Chad said, looking gloomier. &#8220;It just digs new tunnels around and eats more of our vegetables. Yesterday it was the carrots.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Mom said, with a sigh. &#8220;But try again. The Lord knows we planted extra this year so we could give more vegetables to the neighbors.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosie didn&#8217;t wait to hear more, but slipped quietly off her chair. &#8220;I know what I shall ask for first,&#8221; she whispered to herself as she hurried to her bedroom. She knelt by the bed and thought a moment. &#8220;Dear Lord, help me to be a good girl today and obey,&#8221; she began. &#8220;I know You can send the gophers away so they won&#8217;t eat our garden. Please, will you do it for me? Amen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rosie!&#8221; Mom called. &#8220;You need to wash your dishes and do your chores.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mom!&#8221; Rosie said, and hurried off to the kitchen.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_35/answers_flashcards.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="281" /></div>
<p>Chores didn&#8217;t take as long as usual that morning. Rosie was practicing her addition flashcards on the couch when she heard Irene talking to Mom. &#8220;If you can&#8217;t drive me to the library, maybe I can bike there this morning if it isn&#8217;t raining,&#8221; Irene said. &#8220;I need to return the book that is overdue.&#8221; Rosie looked out the window. Dark clouds made the sky look gray and stormy. Here and there she could see a little blue sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Father in heaven,&#8221; she whispered, looking hard at the clouds, &#8220;Make the sun shine, please.&#8221; Rosie smiled. It seemed that the sun <i>had</i> peeped through the clouds a little. &#8220;It is just behind the clouds, but it will come out soon,&#8221; Rosie told herself. She went back to her work, humming the chorus to Irene&#8217;s favorite song:</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Just behind the cloud,
<br />Just behind the cloud,
<br />We are sure the sun is shining just behind the cloud!&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/The_Sun_Behind_the_Cloud/index.html" title="The Sun Behind the Cloud">*</a></p>

<p>Irene came into the room and smiled. &#8220;Just see, Rosie,&#8221; she cried, looking out of the window. &#8220;I think your singing has chased away the rain!&#8221; And sure enough, a bright blue was filling the sky and the sun was shining through.</p>

<p>&#8220;God sent the rain away, because I asked Him to,&#8221; Rosie said, solemnly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and He&#8217;s going to get the gopher caught, too. I just know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Irene laughed. &#8220;We will see,&#8221; she said, pulling on her coat. &#8220;I am thankful for the sunshine at least.&#8221; She tucked a book under her arm and went outside.</p>

<p>Daniel had been sitting at the kitchen table doing a page of math. &#8220;Rosie!&#8221; he whispered, when the door had closed. &#8220;I know what you should pray for. You should pray that we don&#8217;t have to do any more math!&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosie looked at her brother and frowned. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that I should,&#8221; she said slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if we never had to do math any more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think Jesus wants me to do my math,&#8221; said Rosie. &#8220;Besides, we would be stupid if we didn&#8217;t do our schoolwork.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel sighed. &#8220;I guess you&#8217;re right. I just wish I could go outside and try out the kite I made with Dad. This borrowing takes forever!&#8221; He stared glumly at his math paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe if you set your mind on your work it would help,&#8221; Mom said, coming into the room with a basket of laundry. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember? When the people had <i>a mind to work</i> the wall was built in record time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m done with <i>my</i> math,&#8221; Rosie said, jumping up. She smiled mischievously at her brother. As she set her flashcards on the table, she whispered, &#8220;I&#8217;ll pray that your mind will work so we can go outside soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mind <i>does</i> work!&#8221; Daniel grumbled, but then he smiled at his sister. &#8220;Okay. Pray that I will get my work done really fast. I want to go outside before the rain starts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I told you, it <i>won&#8217;t</i> rain,&#8221; Rosie said, shaking her finger at him. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember? I prayed it wouldn&#8217;t rain, &#8217;cause Irene is going to the library.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mom laughed. &#8220;Maybe you should pray that I would have some helpers to fold laundry. It needs to be done,&#8221; she said, looking at Rosie with a merry smile.</p>

<p>Rosie laughed, too. &#8220;I think your helpers will come really soon!&#8221; she said, and skipped down the hall to her bedroom.</p>

<p>It was not long until she was back with Emma and two boxes. &#8220;We fold and put away clothes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; she said with a curtsy. &#8220;Would you like some help?&#8221; And never was the laundry done so fast as that morning!</p>

<p>It was only eleven o&#8217;clock when Mom pronounced that all their work was done and they could go outside. &#8220;You have been such good workers this morning,&#8221; she said, and then smiled at Rosie. &#8220;The Lord has helped you, hasn&#8217;t He?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The verse was true, Mama,&#8221; Rosie said, pointing at the white paper on the fridge. &#8220;I asked for things, and He gave them to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sun is shining and I think it is even a bit windy,&#8221; Daniel said with a grin. He held up his kite. &#8220;Can we go down to the empty lot at the corner to try it out, Mom? There aren&#8217;t any power lines down there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if Chad will go with you,&#8221; Mom said. &#8220;<i>I</i> like to please my children when they ask for good things, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosie and Daniel dashed outside. They found Chad by the back porch staring at something lying by the steps. He kicked it with his shoe and whistled. &#8220;Just look at what the cat caught!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it a rat?&#8221; Daniel asked, picking up a stick to poke it.</p>

<p>Rosie bent closer to look at the furry brown animal. &#8220;But it has a short tail. What is it, Chad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The gopher.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosie looked up quickly and smiled. Her big brother smiled back.</p>

<p>&#8220;God caught it for us,&#8221; she said excitedly. &#8220;I just knew He would!&#8221;</p>
