<h1>The Right Decision</h1>

<p>Robert was spending the weekend with the Davis family. Fred Davis was just his age and Robert soon felt quite at home. &#8220;I really am glad I came,&#8221; Robert told himself as they played games, told riddles, and laughed together. At last Mrs. Davis said it was almost bedtime. Robert expected family prayers, but instead everyone went to their bedrooms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Rob. You&#8217;ll sleep with me,&#8221; said Fred. So Robert followed him upstairs. Fred showed him his model boat and pocket knives. &#8220;We will have so much fun tomorrow, won&#8217;t we?&#8221; he said as he undressed and jumped into bed.</p>

<p>Robert didn&#8217;t know what to think. He remembered his mother&#8217;s goodbye kiss. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget that you are a Christian boy,&#8221; she had whispered. Robert knew well that his parents had raised him to love and obey God. They had prayed for him every day and taught him to pray beside his bed each night. Robert had learned to be glad for bedtime prayers, to ask for God&#8217;s protection and blessings, for he wanted to live for God for himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you come to bed?&#8221; asked Fred. &#8220;What are you sitting there for?&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert was suddenly afraid to pray. What would Fred think of him? It seemed impossible to kneel down right there and tell God all about his day and ask for help to live right. How he wished he had his own room! If only Fred would go to sleep! But Fred would not go to sleep. What could Robert do?</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on to bed,&#8221; Fred cried again.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_35/decision_praying.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="147" /></div>
<p>After a long moment, Robert made his decision. He mustered his courage and said, &#8220;I will pray first. That is what I usually do.&#8221; He felt his face grow hot as he waited to hear what Fred would say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray?&#8221; said Fred, and then turned himself on his pillow and said no more. As Robert knelt by the bed he was ashamed of being a coward. Fred had not made fun of him at all! Robert was thankful that he had made the choice and done what he knew was right. When he crawled into bed at last, his heart was peaceful.</p>

<p>That decision in the Davis home set the course for Robert. One step in the right direction made it easier to do the right thing the next time. So he learned to put prayers first, through whatever trials and temptations he met. He determined that he would never be a coward for the right, and God helped him to succeed. And so Robert grew up to become a brave Christian man.</p>
