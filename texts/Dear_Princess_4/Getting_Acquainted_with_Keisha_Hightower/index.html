<h1>Getting Acquainted with Keisha Hightower</h1>

<h2>Please tell us about yourself, your interests, goals, and values.</h2>
<p>My full name is Keisha Michelle Hightower. I turned 16 on October 2nd. I have brown hair, blue eyes, freckles, and am 5 ft. 5 3/4 inches tall. (That&#8217;s an inch taller than my mom! I had always wanted to be taller than her, but now that I&#8217;ve been taller for a good while, it isn&#8217;t so exciting as before.)</p>

<p>I enjoy reading, messing with my animals, writing and receiving letters, doing calligraphy, being with my friends, and small children, baking and many other things. I spend a lot of time with my numerous animals, and don&#8217;t know what life would be like without at least one pet! I also love having so many pen-friends to encourage and be encouraged by. They are a great blessing to me!</p>

<p>As for my goals, I desire to grow into a woman who is well pleasing to my Heavenly Father, whether I marry or remain single. I would like to perhaps get married if that is within God&#8217;s will far my life, and if I do marry, I hope I have a large family and lots of animals. I would also like to live out in the country, as I feel it is a much better environment to raise a family.</p>

<h2>What is your schooling experience?</h2>
<p>I was homeschooled all of my schooling years and appreciate that. It not only enabled us to be closer as a family, but also, since we can go at our own pace rather than keeping with a class, I graduated this past April from 12th grade at age 15! I love homeschooling so much that I plan to teach any children that I have at home also!</p>

<h2>Is there any special blessing from the Lord that you&#8217;d like to share?</h2>
<p>The Father has blessed me in so many ways it is almost hard to decide what to share, but I am especially thankful that he allowed me to be born into a loving Christian family. My family is very precious to me, and I hate to think how I would have been without my Christian parents to guide me through life! Also, things would be so dull without my brother, Israel, to liven things up! It would be overly quiet, especially, after having him around for so long!</p>

<h2>Please tell us about your family.</h2>
<p>Daddy (Chris) is the head of our home. He is very honest and vocal about his thoughts, and loves to discuss the Bible with other men. He really likes &#8220;new&#8221; like-minded brethren, and is a social type of person. He has a home-based business assembling specialized wood lathes, so we see him quite a bit throughout the day.</p>

<p>Mama (Dorinda) is a homemaker. She is a cheerful and affectionate person who is always willing to listen to us when we need her to. She is also a hard worker, sometimes even working when she should be resting! She can&#8217;t stand sitting while others work and rarely is seen doing so. She enjoys sewing, cooking, reading, writing letters, having company and much more. Mama is a real encouragement to me and my very best friend!</p>

<p>I, Keisha, am rather reserved when I first meet someone, but can be quite a talker when I get to know someone! As I said before, I am quite an animal lover and have quite a few. My favorites are two friendly dogs, our sweet-tempered, yet lively horse (Dakota is mainly Israel&#8217;s), &#8220;my&#8221; sturdy and affectionate little yearling donkey (Taco is his name, he was born on our farm!), my lively and mischievous herd of 23 goats and my kitten. I really enjoy life an the farm!</p>


<p>Israel (13) is outgoing, mischievous, lively and good with his hands. His interests are many and varied, but same of his current hobbies are writing stories, riding his horse, learning to play the guitar, riding his bicycle, running and jumping, and messing with his computer. He helps Daddy out a lot. He also comes in handy when I need something carried that is tao heavy for me, as he is bath taller and stronger than I am! He is my 5 only sibling so far, but we have been praying for more for over seven years now.</p>

<h2>Would you mind sharing a favorite book, poem, or recipe?</h2>
<p>Hmm&#8230;&#8203;a favorite poem? That is hard to chose as I like so many! The following is one of my favorites, and expresses my own feelings exactly.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<h2>A Living Sermon</h2>
<p class="noindent">Edgar A. Guest</p>

<p class="verse">I&#8217;d rather see a sermon than hear one, any day,<br />I&#8217;d rather one would walk with me than merely point the way.<br />The eye&#8217;s a better pupil and more willing than the ear,<br />Fine counsel is confusing, but example&#8217;s always clear.</p>

<p class="verse">The best of all the preachers are the men who live their creeds,<br />For to see good put in action, is what everybody needs.<br />I soon can learn to do it if you let me see it done,<br />I can watch your hands in action, but your tongue too fast may run.</p>

<p class="verse">The lectures you deliver may be very wise and true,<br />But I&#8217;d rather get my lessons by observing what you do.<br />I may not understand the high advice that you may give,<br />But there&#8217;s no misunderstanding how you act or how you live.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<h2>In conclusion, is there anything else you would like to add?</h2>
<p>I am thankful for this opportunity to share with other Christian girls, and hope that you have enjoyed getting to know about my family and me. God bless you all!</p>
