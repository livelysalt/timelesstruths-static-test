<h1>What is <i>Dear Princess</i>?</h1>

<p><i>Dear Princess</i> is a young lady&#8217;s publication for girls who seek and strive to please their Father, the King. I (Abigail Spinks) started it in the fall of 1996 with a burden to share trials and victories, insights and ideas and in turn to hear of other girls trials, victories, insights and ideas. I wanted to create not only a publication with homemaking skills that we need to know, but one that would encourage girls in becoming spiritually prepared for their future. We need to have a vision of trusting on the Lord for a companion long before the actual time. If we wait till the time when we need to trust the Lord for one, we will be ill-prepared. The more grace we have at home with our families now, the more victories we will have behind us when we have bigger trials in homes of our own (if the Lord wills for us to be married). As my mother says, &#8220;The way you set your sails is the way your life is going to be.&#8221; Right now we are in the most moldable time of our lives. I want to be molded in the way Jesus wants me to be and I know there are other girls that want to be too. We need to encourage each other along the way. Mothers, Grandmothers, older sisters are very welcome to write in to encourage and teach us younger women.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness&#8230;&#8203;teachers of good things; That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+2%3A3-5" title="Titus 2:3-5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Titus 2:3-5)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>This publication is free to anyone who requests it. It is sent out prayerfully as the Lord lays upon my heart to do so. (About quarterly.)</p>

<p>I publish <i>Dear Princess</i> with my family&#8217;s help. My parents proofread each issue and I am thankful for their loving guidance. I also want to thank Keisha, Coquetta, Becky, Caitlin, and everyone else who made this issue possible by writing articles, helping with typing and sending in letters. Even though articles from Sister Jenny Rutty and Sister Mabel Hale were written over a hundred years ago, we can still get a lot of good from them. I desire your prayers as I send Out this issue. I wish to do only what the Lord wants done.</p>

<h1>From the Editor</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>Well, the time has rolled around that I have the pleasure of writing to you once more.</p>

<p>I trust you are all encouraged to live for the Lord and am finding more and more that he is the best and dearest friend that you will ever have.</p>

<p>I just wanted to share with you one little thing that the Lord has showed me through a message preached, that trials are actually the signs of more spirituality. It was a great surprise to me as I have often thought, &#8220;Oh, if only they weren&#8217;t such a trial.&#8221; And the more victory I got the more trials I seemed to have. But when I learned that actually trials (taken rightly) were a sign of spiritual progress, I prayed, &#8220;Lord just let the trials come. &#8220; Instead of praying, &#8220;Lord don&#8217;t let it be such a trial to me.&#8221; And then when the trials come and resentment, bitterness, self-pity and pride try to take over me, if I cry, &#8220;Oh, Shepherd, come quickly, make no tarrying,&#8221; as did Much-Afraid, in <i>Hind&#8217;s Feet on High Places</i>, the Lord does came, and with Him there, Bitterness, Resentment, Self-Pity and Pride quickly go away. If I let go and let God give me the victory in every trial I have, if the devil tells me I have more trials then any other girl in the world, I can just tell him that if I do, I can have more victories than anyone else in the world! It is your privilege, your right, that the Lord has given you, to have the victory over every trial you have. I just want to encourage you dear sisters to press on and get the victory through your trials and not to get discouraged by them.</p>

<p class="signature">Living for Him,<br />Abigail</p>

<p>P.S. Thank you all so much for your letters. They were such an encouragement to me!</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Abigail,</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a lovely Saskatchewan day outside the kitchen window: the sky is blue, blue, blue, the sun is shining, and even if the lawn is brown, because of the mid-drought we&#8217;ve been having, the trees are green and flourishing.</p>

<p>I guess I should introduce myself formally.</p>

<p>My name is Rebecca Leigh Schmaltz and I was born January 16th, 1981 so I am now 16. I am about 5 feet l-1/2 inches. I&#8217;m thin, with copper-colored hair, blue eyes, and glasses, and I have lots of freckles. I enjoy pen-friends, history, reading and writing, house-cleaning, organizing, and talking. My family is Daddy (Larry), Mommy (Barb), Heidi (14), Sarah (12), Zachary (going on ten), Hannah (4), and another new sibling due in November! &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_2/My_Sister_Is_a_Princess/index.html" title="Dear Princess 2/My Sister Is a Princess">My Sister Is a Princess</a>&#8221; was a very &#8220;ouch&#8221; sort of article to me. Convicting.</p>

<p>About <a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_3/index.html" title="Dear Princess 3">Vol. 1 Issue 3</a>,
one teensy suggestion&#8230;. could you use a different kind of font for &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_3/From_the_Editor/index.html" title="Dear Princess 3/From the Editor">From the Editor</a>&#8221;? I found it rather difficult to read.</p>

<p>Mommy and I both enjoyed the <a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_3/Following_in_His_Steps/index.html" title="Dear Princess 3/Following in His Steps">interview with the Erickson girls</a>! My sister, Heidi read &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_3/A_Time_to_Laugh/index.html" title="Dear Princess 3/A Time to Laugh">A Time to Laugh</a>&#8221; to me and the first time I didn&#8217;t get it at all. She read it again to me and, then, once I understood it, I had a good laugh. Aren&#8217;t little brothers and sisters cute?</p>

<p>Well, guess I should be going now.</p>

<h1>Getting Acquainted with Keisha Hightower</h1>

<h2>Please tell us about yourself, your interests, goals, and values.</h2>
<p>My full name is Keisha Michelle Hightower. I turned 16 on October 2nd. I have brown hair, blue eyes, freckles, and am 5 ft. 5 3/4 inches tall. (That&#8217;s an inch taller than my mom! I had always wanted to be taller than her, but now that I&#8217;ve been taller for a good while, it isn&#8217;t so exciting as before.)</p>

<p>I enjoy reading, messing with my animals, writing and receiving letters, doing calligraphy, being with my friends, and small children, baking and many other things. I spend a lot of time with my numerous animals, and don&#8217;t know what life would be like without at least one pet! I also love having so many pen-friends to encourage and be encouraged by. They are a great blessing to me!</p>

<p>As for my goals, I desire to grow into a woman who is well pleasing to my Heavenly Father, whether I marry or remain single. I would like to perhaps get married if that is within God&#8217;s will far my life, and if I do marry, I hope I have a large family and lots of animals. I would also like to live out in the country, as I feel it is a much better environment to raise a family.</p>

<h2>What is your schooling experience?</h2>
<p>I was homeschooled all of my schooling years and appreciate that. It not only enabled us to be closer as a family, but also, since we can go at our own pace rather than keeping with a class, I graduated this past April from 12th grade at age 15! I love homeschooling so much that I plan to teach any children that I have at home also!</p>

<h2>Is there any special blessing from the Lord that you&#8217;d like to share?</h2>
<p>The Father has blessed me in so many ways it is almost hard to decide what to share, but I am especially thankful that he allowed me to be born into a loving Christian family. My family is very precious to me, and I hate to think how I would have been without my Christian parents to guide me through life! Also, things would be so dull without my brother, Israel, to liven things up! It would be overly quiet, especially, after having him around for so long!</p>

<h2>Please tell us about your family.</h2>
<p>Daddy (Chris) is the head of our home. He is very honest and vocal about his thoughts, and loves to discuss the Bible with other men. He really likes &#8220;new&#8221; like-minded brethren, and is a social type of person. He has a home-based business assembling specialized wood lathes, so we see him quite a bit throughout the day.</p>

<p>Mama (Dorinda) is a homemaker. She is a cheerful and affectionate person who is always willing to listen to us when we need her to. She is also a hard worker, sometimes even working when she should be resting! She can&#8217;t stand sitting while others work and rarely is seen doing so. She enjoys sewing, cooking, reading, writing letters, having company and much more. Mama is a real encouragement to me and my very best friend!</p>

<p>I, Keisha, am rather reserved when I first meet someone, but can be quite a talker when I get to know someone! As I said before, I am quite an animal lover and have quite a few. My favorites are two friendly dogs, our sweet-tempered, yet lively horse (Dakota is mainly Israel&#8217;s), &#8220;my&#8221; sturdy and affectionate little yearling donkey (Taco is his name, he was born on our farm!), my lively and mischievous herd of 23 goats and my kitten. I really enjoy life an the farm!</p>


<p>Israel (13) is outgoing, mischievous, lively and good with his hands. His interests are many and varied, but same of his current hobbies are writing stories, riding his horse, learning to play the guitar, riding his bicycle, running and jumping, and messing with his computer. He helps Daddy out a lot. He also comes in handy when I need something carried that is tao heavy for me, as he is bath taller and stronger than I am! He is my 5 only sibling so far, but we have been praying for more for over seven years now.</p>

<h2>Would you mind sharing a favorite book, poem, or recipe?</h2>
<p>Hmm&#8230;&#8203;a favorite poem? That is hard to chose as I like so many! The following is one of my favorites, and expresses my own feelings exactly.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<h2>A Living Sermon</h2>
<p class="noindent">Edgar A. Guest</p>

<p class="verse">I&#8217;d rather see a sermon than hear one, any day,<br />I&#8217;d rather one would walk with me than merely point the way.<br />The eye&#8217;s a better pupil and more willing than the ear,<br />Fine counsel is confusing, but example&#8217;s always clear.</p>

<p class="verse">The best of all the preachers are the men who live their creeds,<br />For to see good put in action, is what everybody needs.<br />I soon can learn to do it if you let me see it done,<br />I can watch your hands in action, but your tongue too fast may run.</p>

<p class="verse">The lectures you deliver may be very wise and true,<br />But I&#8217;d rather get my lessons by observing what you do.<br />I may not understand the high advice that you may give,<br />But there&#8217;s no misunderstanding how you act or how you live.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<h2>In conclusion, is there anything else you would like to add?</h2>
<p>I am thankful for this opportunity to share with other Christian girls, and hope that you have enjoyed getting to know about my family and me. God bless you all!</p>

<div class="blurb">
<p class="noindent first">From Abigail&#8217;s Mother:</p>

<p>As a young woman I heard about an old, out-of-print book, entitled <i>Letters of Love and Counsel for &#8220;Our Girls&#8221;</i>, by Jennie C. Rutty. I have desired to read its contents and just recently some dear folks loaned us a copy! Isn&#8217;t the Lord gracious! He knew my desire, and granted it, just at the right time in my own girls lives!</p>

<p>We would also like to share portions of it with you. We trust it will be a blessing.</p>

</div>


<h1>Right and Wrong</h1>

<p class="author">Jennie C. Rutty</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Girls:</p>

<p>There are very few of you who have not some idea of the meaning of these words; for they are used very often in general conversation. Little children are taught by their parents that they must not do certain things, because &#8220;it is naughty,&#8221; or &#8220;wrong.&#8221; Teachers often express themselves that they are &#8220;glad so many of the pupils try to do right.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is therefore a consciousness in all that there is good and evil in the world, and that it is best to choose the good and avoid the evil. But there is not in all a strong decision to do so, and they are continually mingling some good deeds with some evil ones. Others find within themselves such a love for that which is wrong that they run in the way of all evil greedily, silencing the conscience within as it makes its protest, by plunging deeper into wrong-doing.</p>

<p>Now, dear girls, is it not the best and the noblest way to look everything squarely in the face and make a decision for that which will in the end be to our advantage or for our good? I think I hear some of you saying, &#8220;Yes, indeed, that is best.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is a time in every child&#8217;s life when it begins to know right from wrong; but it varies in age, as some are more perfectly taught than others. This is termed &#8220;age of accountability.&#8221; One sister remembered her first wrong-doing for which she was accountable. She was in her seventh year and was visiting at a neighbor&#8217;s with her older sister. As they were leaving, she spied a pretty piece of cloth near the doorstep. Picking it up, she hid it under her apron and followed her sister with shamed face. Her sister saw something was wrong, and by questioning found out the trouble, and they retraced their steps to return what was wrongfully taken. The guilt felt, the shame and remorse, made her determine not to do so again.</p>

<p>The heart of the child is tender, and wrong-doing is very keenly felt; but if continued in, the heart is hardened, and though the conscience may sometimes speak to faithfully warn the offender, its warnings are not heeded, nor is the heart pained thereby. There is a remembrance of my childhood days. When evil was presented, how very, very bad it seemed! But the longer I looked upon it and listened to the usual excuses for it, the less awful it seemed; and by and by, the yielding thereto seemed to be necessary, and I blamed my surroundings instead of myself. Perhaps you all have had like experiences. Do you not wish you could be as innocent as when you first beheld evil and shrank from it? Innocence is not ignorance; far you may have knowledge of very wicked things, but if you do not partake or indulge in that evil, you are innocent of it. So if you can be kept from all wrong, you are innocent as a little child that does not know right from wrong. There is a blessed opportunity of being innocent, and in a future letter I will tell you about it. Now we want to look further into this subject of right and wrong, of good and evil.</p>

<p>This world is a great battlefield, for two forces stand opposing each other&#8212;God and the right, and the Devil and wrong. Each force is trying to gain individuals to its ranks. God and the right give life&#8212;eternal life&#8212;heaven with all its glory, and a present life of peace and joy, to each subject. The Devil and wrong give death&#8212;eternal death&#8212;hell with all its terrors, and a present life of bondage to evil with its bitter pleasures, to each of their subjects. Just to look out upon this world you may not observe this wonderful battle. There are some things to which we need to have our eyes opened by the Spirit of God, in order to see clearly. But most of you have felt at different times in your life a real battle, a severe conflict in your heart and mind in regard to doing certain things. If you think of this going on in the heart and life of every man, woman, and child, after they are accountable, you may begin to comprehend its magnitude and importance.</p>

<p>Why is it thus? Why is it permitted? Oh, dear girls, wiser minds than ours have asked these questions, brooded aver them, and gone to their graves with them unanswered. As our eyes look out upon this beautiful world with so many blessings and comforts, so many things to make life enjoyable to the inhabitants, and we behold how wonderfully the laws work together far their good, our hearts and minds confidently assert there is a mighty God, creator of all things. In showing his love to us, He reveals himself as a God of love, and those things we do not understand, we leave unquestioned, knowing He doeth all things well, according to His precious word&#8212;
<span class="scripture">&#8220;All things work together for good to them that love God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A28" title="Romans 8:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 8:28)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handiwork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+91%3A1-4" title="Psalm 91:1-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 91:1-4)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>What beautiful language to declare that the works of God are drawing us to himself, and every people and nation should be inquiring for him and learning of him! Can we not stand boldly for the right in all things, when we have such a mighty King?</p>

<p>If we compare right and wrong in their present effects upon ourselves, we find right always gives a clear conscience, a sense of victory, a knowledge that it will work for good to others, and it makes ourselves into nobler beings. While evil may appear mast lovely and give promise of working out great good, its appearance is always deceitful, and it works against our own welfare and against others. One wrong-doing leads to another and that leads to others, thus bringing into bondage in many ways.</p>

<p>Each individual has a certain disposition, which is inherited, that desires to be gratified. It is natural therefore for all to choose a life course that is pleasing to themselves, and they often try to believe that there is nothing wrong in their course of life. But they find others condemn as wrong many of their motives and actions. So there arises a questioning in their minds. Should they expect it to be settled by the opinions of men, they will be disappointed; for there is a great diversity of belief as to what constitutes right and wrong. So we see the need of a steadfast and true standard of right; but where shall we look for it? As God is the great Creator and has shown His loving-kindness in supplying our temporal needs, would it not be wise to look to Him? Should we not expect, as He is ruler of the universe, that He would wish to control and instruct His subjects in all that pertains to their best interests, and in His great wisdom decide all questions arising in regard to their welfare? This He has done, and we should be truly thankful that he has supplied the great need by giving us His word, the truth, the Holy Bible.</p>

<h1>Exclusive Friends</h1>

<p>There are some friendships which glory in being exclusive. Take the case of Milly and Mary for instance. As their affections for each other grew, it seemed to crowd out other affections. Milly was a little jealous of the other girls who had been especially friendly with Mary before her own friendship began, and Mary had the same feelings toward Milly&#8217;s old friends. The result was that they saw less and less of other girls and more and more of each other. They walked to and from school with an arm about each other&#8217;s waist. Neither liked to accept an invitation which did not include the other.</p>

<p>If they were separated during vacation, as sometimes happened, they wrote to each other daily, and no matter how good a time they might be having, openly rejoiced to have it. end, that they might be together again.</p>

<p>These exclusive friendships are very likely to appeal to the imagination of young girls, but there is a great deal to be said against them. The best friend for you is not the girl who has no time for anyone but you, but the one who has many friends and love enough to go around. The affection which shut out all but the two most concerned is too selfish to be desirable. No girl can restrict her friendship to a single person without narrowing herself. It is as big a mistake as to read only one book or to eat only one kind of food. These intense friendships are very likely to come to a sudden and violent end. They break down by their own weight. They exact too much to be enduring. Sooner or later something happens, and the breaking off of such exclusive friendships generally means that hostility takes the place of the over-ardent affection.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t restrict yourself to one friend, however charming she may be. Don&#8217;t let yourself feel that you can&#8217;t be happy anywhere without her. You may prefer roses to violets or lilies-of-the-valley, but that is no good reason for weeding the latter plants out of your garden. The sensible way is to enjoy the fragrance of all sweet flowers and the friendship of all sweet girls.</p>

<h1>The Strength of Obedience</h1>

<p class="author">Mabel Hale</p>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first"><span class="scripture">&#8220;Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Samuel+15%3A22" title="I&nbsp;Samuel 15:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Samuel 15:22)</span></a></span></p>
</div>


<p>The foundation of all perfect deportment is found in obedience. All the universe is under obedience. The stars move in their respective places, the sun and moon in their orbits, and the earth upon its yearly course around the sun, all acting according to one common law that guides them all. The seasons come and go, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, day and night, all according to laws that are never broken. And if by chance one of these laws should be broken, all the great universe would become chaos. All that God has made he has placed under law, and all moves on in harmony and splendor. Mankind also was placed under law, but not in the absolute sense that governs the universe. He was made like God in that he could know good and evil and choose for himself. If he should choose that which is right he <i>should</i> bring to himself blessings and peace, but if he chose the evil he should bring down upon his own head the results of that choice. From this law of reward no man may in the end find an escape. Of all that God made, man alone dared to be disobedient. He who could have brought most glory to God has from the beginning dishonored Him.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of obedience. In the first a weaker person is overcome by a stronger and compelled to obey by superior force. His will is not in the obedience, but rather against it. He will cease to be obedient when opportunity permits. This is the obedience that criminals give to laws, slaves to their masters, and which many children give to their parents and teachers. It is the soil in which rebellion grows, and it is always dangerous. Its end is always unrestraint, turmoil, and anarchy.</p>

<p>True obedience begins in the heart. The person obeying gives sanction to the law, acknowledging that it is right, and obeys because he believes it to be his duty to do so. He needs no law, officer, nor master to compel him, for he is master of his own soul and demands of himself that which is right. Such a man is great indeed who is able to make himself obedient to God and right. When the lesson of self-government is learned, one of life&#8217;s greatest victories is won.</p>

<p>The girl who comes to perfect womanhood must learn to be obedient. Her whole life must be governed, not by whim or pleasure, but by right and duty. Her first lessons of obedience are learned at home. She becomes aware that all things are not for her personal convenience and pleasure, but that she must do her part in service, restraint, and sacrifice, that home may be orderly and happy. Her parents give her many and various commands. Some of them seem hard and unnecessary. They interfere with her desires and plans, and the temptation to disregard them as far as possible is great. She feels hampered and bound and unable to carry out her designs. But she who is building good character takes heed to the commands given her, whether good or bad, and receives the admonitions and reproofs which come her way, governing herself by them, because it is right that she do so.</p>

<p>This lesson of obedience in spite of the rebellion in the heart is not learned all at once. But every girl does not have the same hard battle with it. Here is one point where she who is blest with a humble and submissive nature has the advantage. She can do quite naturally what her willful and rebellious sister will have to struggle hard to accomplish. Many girls are like my little friend Betty. Betty was willful by nature, and obedience came hard. She had been exceptionally willful in a certain matter, and her father had reproved her sharply, cutting off privileges that Betty valued very much. She felt angry and rebellious against her father for the penalty that he had exacted, and unburdened her heart to her mother in angry little bursts. Her mother answered, &#8220;We will not discuss Father now. You are angry and cannot think clearly. But you will confess that it is not impossible for you to obey to the letter all that he has required. What your rebellious nature needs, my daughter, is to be compelled to obey, and you are the one to do it. The commandment has been given you, and if you want to be victor obey it exactly, for your own soul&#8217;s good. It is the easiest way out of your difficulty, and the best thing for your development.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betty had the good sense to see this, and though her heart did yet rebel, she said, &#8220;I shall do that.&#8221; And she found the hardest part of her punishment was over when she had brought down her stubborn spirit.</p>

<p>Obedience is never outgrown. It is not merely a requirement of childhood, but is just as necessary in later years. After a girl leaves the care of her parents and teachers she remains yet the servant of duty. In fact, the more she is thrown upon her own responsibility the more loudly duty speaks to her, becoming either a tyrant exacting obedience from an unwilling heart, or a good friend and guide leading on to right, just as the girl takes it.</p>

<p>There were long stretches in Betty&#8217;s childhood and youth in which the girl did practically as she desired to do. She followed the dictates of her own free will. It is true that to do this she had to keep within the bounds of law and order; but she found that no bondage. Now, however, since duty beckons her she is pressed on every side. There is scarcely any time she can call her own. She must do her duty or lose her own self-respect. She has duty to herself, to her family, to her friends, to the church, to her community, and to her God. If she has not learned obedience and rebels at service she will find her life hard indeed; but if she wills to do her duty and obeys from choice the commands of her stern mistress, then she will be happy in just doing her duty.</p>

<p>There is rare pleasure in obedience. The answer of a good conscience brings into the heart a peace and satisfaction that nothing can destroy. The girl who can fold her hands at night with the knowledge that throughout the day she has been obedient to God and right, finds in life a gladness and quietness that nothing else can bring.</p>

<p>If you would be happy through life and make a success of the years which will be given to you, learn now in your girlhood to obey, to bring yourself under control, where reason rules, not mere whim or fancy. And the responsibility of this discipline dare not be left to parents and teachers. The girl who really learns obedience must take herself in hand and be a conqueror. Others can compel your servile obedience, but only you can bring to  your heart true, God-fearing obedience. Only true obedience uplifts and enlightens and makes life noble. Be your own mistress, bringing yourself into obedience.</p>

<h2>Contentment</h2>
<p class="author">Anna Lititia Waring</p>

<p class="verse">Father, I know that all my life<br />Is portioned out for me;<br />And the changes that are sure to come<br />I do not fear to see;<br />I ask Thee for a patient mind,<br />Intent on pleasing Thee.</p>

<p class="verse">I ask Thee for a thoughtful love,<br />Through constant watching wise,<br />To meet the glad and joyful smiles,<br />And wipe the weeping eyes,<br />And a heart, at leisure from itself,<br />To soothe and sympathize.</p>

<p class="verse">I would not have the restless will<br />That hurries to and fro,<br />Seeking some great thing to do,<br />Or secret thing to know;<br />I would be treated as a child,<br />And guided where I go.</p>

<p class="verse">Whatever in this world I am,<br />In whatsoe&#8217;er estate,<br />I have a fellowship with hearts<br />To keep and cultivate,<br />And a work of lowly love to do<br />For the Lord on Whom I wait.</p>

<p class="verse">So I ask Thee for the daily strength&#8212;<br />To none that ask denied&#8212;<br />And a mind to blend with outward life,<br />While keeping at Thy side,<br />Content to fill a little space,<br />If Thou be glorified.</p>

<p class="verse">There are briers besetting every path,<br />Which call for constant care;<br />There is a cross in every lot,<br />And an earnest need for prayer;<br />But a lowly heart that leans on Thee,<br />Is happy everywhere.</p>

<p class="verse">In service which Thy love appoints<br />There are no bonds for me,<br />For my secret heart has learned the truth<br />Which makes Thy children free,<br />And a life of self-renouncing love<br />Is a life of liberty.</p>

<h2>Obedience</h2>
<p class="verse">Dear Good, teach me the reason why<br />I shouldn&#8217;t have my way.<br />Oh, show me plainly that it is<br />A great mistake to disobey.<br />But still I ought to see<br />That mother knows what I should do,<br />And what is best for me.<br />Teach me to be obedient.<br />Oh, make me understand<br />That, if I <i>mind</i> when I am young,<br />I <i>must</i> grow worthy to command.<br />Oh, God, I need Your guiding hand<br />To lead me surely day by day;<br />I need Your wisdom, so I&#8217;ll see<br />That all the truest girls obey.</p>

<h1>Open Doors</h1>

<p>Time goes so quickly, doesn&#8217;t it? And with it doors open and close. I want to share with you about one door that has been open to our family all summer and the year before.</p>

<p>We have been taking care of two children down the street (during the day), three days a week. We liked having them in our home, and they loved being here. We tried to involve them in our daily tasks, and it worked to an extent. They loved Bible stories and we taught them spiritual songs. But now the summer is over, and their mother had asked for them to be with us for the school year also. That was fine with us, but she called last night, and told us she was moving. As I was thinking about it later, this thought occurred to me, &#8220;That was a door that just closed, that has been open to us all sumer and the year before. A privilege we had, to show those children the way to Jesus, is not there anymore. Did we use our time wisely; did we take advantage of our open door?&#8221;</p>

<p>We have open doors every day&#8212;our trials. God is always giving us trials that are open doors. Every single trial we have is a chance to be an example, to show someone what Christ was like. Oh, dear sisters, take those privileges to be examples seriously! They are <i>so</i> important! We can be having a trial, that the Lord has designed to encourage someone else, but the devil wants us not only to damage ourselves by acting in an ungodly way, but to discourage others. He wants them to think, &#8220;Well, so-and-so did that, and they claim to be saved,&#8221; or, &#8220;See, they aren&#8217;t acting right, either. I guess nobody ever can be really good, really submissive to their parents, like the Bible says,&#8221; etc. Don&#8217;t you known the devil is happy when he gets two people or more discouraged by one trial?</p>

<p>And the Lord is also there. Holding grace for us. Grace that, if we would take it, would turn our failures int victories. But, dear sisters, grace is just not handed out automatically. We have to pay a price for it. If you pray, asking the Lord for grace, and then just expect your prayers to go through without humbling yourself and asking the Lord to give you meekness and a more selfless heart, nothing will happen and then the devil will be even happier because most likely you will get discouraged.</p>

<p>That happened to me. I could not understand why I was not getting the help from the Lord. As always, there was a reason. In my case, I had my trouble in striving with others. The reason I wasn&#8217;t getting the grace I needed was because I had pride in my heart. I couldn&#8217;t stand others coming out better than me, in ideas, etc. I was not consciously being proud, but when I asked the Lord why I couldn&#8217;t get grace, He showed me. And when I humbled myself, He gave the grace I needed. Once I had that grace, I could take advantage of those open doors, which are open to us all.</p>

<p>I have a baking business, and one morning I was really rushing to meet a deadline. I had fifteen dozen cookies to bake, and the lady needed them by 7:00 am to take to work. I had overslept, and was trying to hurry to be through on time. I must have bumped the table&#8212;anyway, something caused a big tray of cookies (about 7 dozen) to come crashing down to the floor. I was devastated, to say the least, for the first minute. Then I asked the Lord to give me grace and said, &#8220;Thank you, Lord, for this trial,&#8221; and began to pick up the pieces. That was an open door to show that there is victory in a trial like that. Even though no one was watching, it helped <i>me</i>&#8212;it was another step closer to living with God. Isn&#8217;t the Lord good to us? He knew I was in a hurry, He knew that I needed to have those cookies knocked off&#8212;even though that was not what I would have thought. He had opened a door for me to be an example for Him, and, since I took advantage of the open door, He blessed me for it. Because, instead of an embarrassing situation of not having an order filled in time, I was ready and waiting.</p>

<p>There have been open doors when I haven&#8217;t asked the Lord for grace, and they closed, and the opportunity to be an example was gone. We have open doors right now. Doors that are open only a little while, and then close quickly. A lot of times we don&#8217;t look past the trial to see the door God has opened for us.</p>

<p>If you take advantage of those open doors the Lord gives you, and get the grace you need from God, other people will wonder, &#8220;What is it that makes so-and-so so sweet, so willing to help?&#8221; It is the grace of God, shining out from you. And, since you took advantage of those doors and did well in the sight of the Lord, it opens more doors to sink further into God&#8217;s grace. I desire your prayers that I may also take advantage of every door opened unto me.</p>

<h1>Contentment in the Present</h1>

<p>Do you ever look back on the &#8220;good old days&#8221;? It is all right to do so to a certain extent, but do not dwell on them. Here are some reasons why.</p>

<p>First of all, the present days are likely just as good as those former times. You probably still have your needs met, and health about the same. Also it was the Lord&#8217;s will that these days are the way they are (unless you are interfering with the Lord&#8217;s will). Another thing, back in the &#8220;good old days&#8221; they were probably looking back at the &#8220;good old days&#8221; before them and thinking how nice <i>they</i> were.</p>

<p>Second, thinking of the former days could (and usually does) cause discontentment and also makes you less useful. You won&#8217;t get any joy from the present, and in the days to come, won&#8217;t have these years to think back on as the &#8220;good old days.&#8221; Instead of pouting about these present days, you should make the best of each moment, getting as much joy out of them as you can.</p>

<p>You need to have a forward and upward outlook instead of a downward and backward outlook. You need to press toward heaven, Philippians 3 tells us, instead of slipping backward to hell. Paul even wrote that you should forget what happened in the former days. So don&#8217;t dwell on things of the past, but on things of the present. Let Christ give you joy in the present, by serving Him and submitting yourself to his will. Then as you get older, you will be able to look back on these &#8220;good old days.&#8221;</p>

<h1>A Time to Sew</h1>

<h2>Postage Stamp Quilt</h2>
<p>Want to try your hand at quilt making?</p>

<p>Cut a 1-1/2 or 2-inch pattern out of sandpaper or crocus cloth, using <i>old</i> scissors. Press your fabrics, then lay sandpaper, rough side down, on fabric to trace around with a pencil, or simply cut around the sandpaper&#8212;whichever is easier for you. Start with one special piece of fabric in the center. You will need 4 squares of your next color, then 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24. Take -inch seams. Be careful. Make it as accurate as possible&#8212;the corners should meet! Set each of these blocks together with a chain of white patches.</p>

<p>If a quilt seems overwhelming, just make a pillow, or one block makes a charming doll quilt. Enjoy sewing!</p>
