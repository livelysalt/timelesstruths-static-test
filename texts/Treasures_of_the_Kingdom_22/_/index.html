<h1>Tracks in the Snow</h1>

<p>It was winter vacation and the Coleman family was taking a trip to visit Grandpa and Grandma Wilke and the cousins. &#8220;A whole week on the farm!&#8221; Daniel exclaimed, as he packed his bag. &#8220;Will there be snow? I can hardly remember the last time we went.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were only four years old,&#8221; Chad said with a laugh. &#8220;I think they usually have snow about now. Perhaps we&#8217;ll go sledding on the hill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or tracking in the woods,&#8221; said Daniel. &#8220;I&#8217;m bringing my track guide. I&#8217;ve been studying about tracking because I want to be a forest ranger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you can practice,&#8221; Chad said, putting on his shoes. &#8220;Steve says there are lots of trails in the woods behind Grandpa&#8217;s place.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was snowing hard when the Coleman family drove up to the Wilke farm late that night. Daniel was glad to tumble out into the cold outdoors after being in the stuffy van so long. The air was filled with swirling snowflakes and happy shouts as everyone gathered around.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_22/tracks_meeting.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="260" /></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you came,&#8221; a voice said. Daniel looked up to see a tall boy smiling at him. &#8220;You must be Chad&#8217;s brother? I&#8217;m Stephen.&#8221; Chad and the other boys joined them and soon they were all tramping into Grandma&#8217;s warm kitchen for hot cocoa.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much snow do you get out here?&#8221; said freckle-faced Jeremy, who was eleven.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bet it&#8217;ll snow three feet tonight!&#8221; Stephen&#8217;s younger brother, Alex, said. &#8220;We can make the biggest snow fort ever and have a grand battle tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to go tracking,&#8221; put in Daniel. &#8220;Do you have wild animals in the woods?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, sure,&#8221; Alex said. &#8220;Hundreds of deer, and Steve tracks wolves and cougar all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow-wee! Don&#8217;t they kill people?&#8221; exclaimed Jeremy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said Daniel, glad of a chance to say something. &#8220;Wolves go in packs and cougar hunt alone, but they don&#8217;t bother people. I&#8217;ve been studying about them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good for you,&#8221; said Stephen. &#8220;It should be clear tomorrow, and we&#8217;ll have lots of fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>Early the next morning, as soon as the wood box was filled, the boys began planning their day. Daniel puffed a cloud in the cold air and looked at the sparkling snow-covered forest. &#8220;Let&#8217;s make a scout team. I want to go tracking,&#8221; he suggested. But Jeremy only picked bark off his jacket and Billy was pulling out his sled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s make a fort!&#8221; Alex shouted, as he spun a cartwheel on the fresh snow.</p>

<p>&#8220;The snow is really too cold to stick,&#8221; Chad said, trying to pack a snowball. &#8220;How about sledding?&#8221;</p>

<p>Stephen had taken out the shovel and was clearing the walk. &#8220;That sounds like fun,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;Where are the sledding tubes, Alex?&#8221;</p>

<p>The younger boy grinned. &#8220;They were full of holes so I used them for my go-cart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too bad,&#8221; Stephen said. &#8220;If you want, Billy, I can make a sledding track for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be any fun,&#8221; Billy said with a frown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go up to the old trapper&#8217;s cabin!&#8221; Alex cried, jumping up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s!&#8221; said Daniel, slapping his pocket where the tracking guide was stored. &#8220;Is it far?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are several trails, but the best one is about three miles and goes up the ridge,&#8221; said Stephen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will there be cougars?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jeremy asks the most stupid questions, Daniel thought. He doesn&#8217;t know anything about the woods!</p>

<p>&#8220;We might see a few prints,&#8221; Stephen said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go see if we can be gone this morning.&#8221; Alex began talking about a 12-foot panther and Chad went inside with Stephen to see about a sack lunch. At last they were off, tramping over the snow drifts. Under the trees the snow was thin and it was easier going. Daniel soon noticed a deer path and veered off to follow it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here!&#8221; Jeremy suddenly yelled from the top of a fallen log. &#8220;Look at these cool tracks!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Deer,&#8221; laughed Alex. &#8220;None of the big guys come this far down.&#8221; Stephen was starting up a trail between some young trees, and the others fell into line behind.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_22/tracks_track.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="239" /></div>
<p>Daniel tried to watch for animal signs like his guide book talked about. Under trees, leading to water&#8230;&#8203;he just had to find a cougar print. &#8220;Watch your head!&#8221; Chad said, and Daniel looked up just in time to miss a tree branch.</p>

<p>They were up in a pine woods when Alex pointed out a bear tree and begin talking about the big black bear he had seen once. Daniel was tired of his talking, and disappointed that he had spotted the ripped bark first. &#8220;Just be quiet a bit,&#8221; he grumbled. &#8220;You&#8217;re scaring all the animals.&#8221; Just then he noticed a large, rounded shape in the snow and pulled out his track guide. Could it be&#8230;&#8203;?</p>

<p>&#8220;Cougar,&#8221; Stephen said quietly, bending down to study a second print. &#8220;Fresh, too. I wouldn&#8217;t think&#8230;&#8203;&#8221; Daniel looked up to see concern on his cousin&#8217;s face. What did Steve know?</p>

<p>The others crowded around excitedly and Alex said it was a big one, maybe the biggest yet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care a bit about any old cougars,&#8221; Billy said, picking up a stick. The others smiled, but Daniel felt impatient to get going. I&#8217;ll track it and show them&#8230;&#8203;he was starting up the trail when Stephen stepped forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait. I think this print is only a few minutes old. Look over there!&#8221; Daniel looked up and stepped back in surprise. There, under a tall pine, lay a deer with long red slashes on its side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it dead?&#8221; asked Jeremy, wide-eyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like it,&#8221; Alex said, taking Billy&#8217;s stick and stepping closer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t bleeding much&#8230;&#8203;and it&#8217;s warm. When do you think it happened, Steve?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About 10 minutes ago.&#8221; Everyone looked at Stephen, and Daniel felt a little shiver creep up his back. Maybe I don&#8217;t know so much after all, he thought. Stephen studied the snow and shook his head. &#8220;That cougar is awful hungry to be out at this time. We better be heading out of here.&#8221; He reached for Billy&#8217;s hand and started down the slope with long steps. The rest of the boys hurried to follow without a word. Daniel nearly screamed when a stick cracked right behind him. It was only Chad, but Daniel&#8217;s heart beat faster.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_22/tracks_branch.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="236" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Is he following us?&#8221; Jeremy gulped, as Stephen stopped at the bottom of the pine woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Steve said, and smiled down at Billy, who was trembling. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be fine, but wasn&#8217;t that something? I&#8217;ve never seen a cougar catch so fresh.&#8221; Daniel let out his breath and dared to look around.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow! Won&#8217;t that be a story to tell everyone?&#8221; Alex said, a smile returning to his round face. And it was, though the mothers scolded when they found out.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Mama,&#8221; Daniel said, &#8220;Steve was really careful and he was watching out for us. He knows lots about the woods and the wild animals. Alex says he tracks them all the time. Maybe he&#8217;ll teach me a little bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad,&#8221; Mother said. &#8220;Stephen is a good example to learn from.&#8221; And Daniel agreed.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_22/Before_Honor/index.html">Before Honor</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Before Honor</h1>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Before honour is humility.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+15%3A33" title="Proverbs 15:33"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 15:33)</span></a></span></p>

<p>We all want to look important and special, don&#8217;t we? When you learn something new you want to tell about it. If you know something it is easy to want to show off. But this is not a good way to get attention. Listen and see if you can figure out the way to true respect.</p>

<p>In the story, how was Stephen a good example to Daniel? Even though he knew a lot, he didn&#8217;t try to look important. Instead, he used what he knew to help others. Stephen never made fun of anyone or argued for his own way. He was greatest, because he was
<span class="scripture">&#8220;servant of all,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+10%3A44" title="Mark 10:44"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 10:44)</span></a></span>
and thought of others first.</p>

<p>Everyone respects a person like that. Not because they show off. Not because they act bigger or can talk better than everyone else. No, they are more quiet, not trying to be the best. What they are shows by how they serve and care for others. They take time to learn and listen, instead of talk and tell. They are called a person of honor, because they choose to live right no matter what others say or do.</p>

<p>How can we be a person of honor? It starts with realizing how small we really are. It wasn&#8217;t until Daniel was in the middle of the woods that he realized that he didn&#8217;t know much. If he had acted &#8220;smart&#8221; and ignored Stephen&#8217;s warning, he could have been hurt.</p>

<p>When we are humble we will want to learn from others and not think of ourselves. Most of all, we will realize we need God to guide and take care of us. He knows everything, and we really don&#8217;t. Without Him, we will mess up our lives and end up in big trouble. To obey and follow Jesus is to be a person of honor.</p>

<h1>The Raindrop Study</h1>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_22/raindrop_a.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="184" /></div>
<p>Are you ready to take another lesson from God&#8217;s creation? Let&#8217;s go on a hike up into the hills. It is a wet, cold day, with gray clouds. You will need a raincoat and boots. To be good scientists, let&#8217;s take a notepad and binoculars, too.</p>

<p>Here we are on a wilderness trail. Long hemlock branches protect us from some of the raindrops. The earth smells damp and cold, and soon our coats are dripping. But it has been dry and we need the rain. &#8220;Why?&#8221; you ask. Good question! Now let&#8217;s look around for the answer. Across a high misty meadow we tramp until we come to a deer path. Let us follow it and see where it leads. We come to a small stream where the grass is thick and green. Now we can see where some of the raindrops have gone and why they are important! The deer and the plants both need water to live.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_22/raindrop_b.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="176" /></div>
<p>But where does this stream go? Bubbling and splashing it rushes over rocks and under mossy logs. More water joins the stream from gullies and dripping branches until it has become a wide creek. Now the forest is thick with trees and bushes. Birds chirp from branches and more animal trails join the creek path. Where will it take us? Down, down&#8230;&#8203;and here we are at a long, deep lake! It is hidden low between the hills with dark forests surrounding the calm water.</p>

<p>As we sit quietly on a fallen log, a heron lands in the shallow water and wood ducks swim by. What makes this place so special? All those falling raindrops and bubbling streams have joined to make something great and beautiful. &#8220;How?&#8221; you ask. By going down, down, down to the lowest place of all.</p>

<p>Here is our lesson that the Prince of Peace Himself told us:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+20%3A27" title="Matthew 20:27"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 20:27)</span></a></span>
Do you want to be important? When you are willing to just be little, like the falling raindrop, and think of others before yourself, you will be the greatest blessing to all around you.</p>

<h2>A Little Thing to Do</h2>
<p>Do you think that small things make the biggest difference? They do. The little raindrops fill the stream, the tiny snowflakes cover the trees, and those that spend time doing small deeds of kindness are the truly great. It is the little things we say and do each day that makes our day good or bad.</p>

<p>Try these little things to brighten today (there is enough for one each hour):</p>

<ul>
<li>answer cheerfully and quickly</li>

<li>smile at a sad face</li>

<li>sing a song</li>

<li>offer to help without being asked</li>

<li>do something kind for a surprise</li>

<li>save your play until you&#8217;ve done your work</li>

<li>help make a special treat</li>

<li>put a picture or note on someone&#8217;s pillow</li>

<li>tidy your room</li>

<li>put a candle or basket of fruit on the table</li>

<li>think about one of your inheritance promises</li>

<li>pray for someone</li>

</ul>

<h2>What Do They Say?</h2>
<p class="verse">Hark! hark! My children, hark!<br />When the sky has lost its blue,<br />What do the stars sing in the dark?<br />&#8220;We must sparkle, sparkle, through.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">What do leaves say in the storm,<br />Tossed in whispering heaps together?<br />&#8220;We can keep the violets warm<br />&#8217;Til they wake in fairer weather.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">What do happy birdies say,<br />Flitting through the gloomy wood?<br />&#8220;We must sing the gloom away&#8212;<br />Sun or shadow, God is good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tod is sad,&#8221; Sammy said. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t see his daddy much. He says his step-dad is mean, and that no one loves him. Is that true, Grandpa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is sad that Tod&#8217;s family is broken up,&#8221; Grandpa said. &#8220;But Jesus loves him and wants to help him. Let me tell you a story&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

<h1>The Man at the Well</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+4%3A5-29">John 4:5-29</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">There once lived a woman in a village called Sychar. There was a well outside the village and as a little girl she went with the other girls to get water from it. She had heard the story of how Jacob had dug the well and lived with his family there. Like all the other girls, she dreamed of having her own family and someone to love her someday. But when she grew up and got married, she wasn&#8217;t happy. Her home wasn&#8217;t loving like she had thought it would be. There were quarrels and fights, and soon her home was broken up.</p>

<p>Months went by. Not many smiles came her way, and the woman was lonely. &#8220;If I only had someone to love me,&#8221; she thought. Another man married her, but she soon got tired of him. &#8220;He is selfish. He doesn&#8217;t really love me,&#8221; she said. So she complained and grumbled about everything he did until he left her. And that is how life went for her.</p>

<p>Now the woman walked alone to the well. The other women wouldn&#8217;t talk to her. &#8220;She has lived a bad life,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Five men have married her and she was never happy.&#8221; The woman tried not to listen, but it was true. Now she lived with a man who beat her when he was mad. &#8220;No one has ever loved me,&#8221; she thought. But she was wrong.</p>

<p>This day when she came to the well, a strange man was sitting on the edge. &#8220;May I have a drink?&#8221; he asked. The woman stopped and frowned. &#8220;Why do you ask me?&#8221; she said. He was a Jew, and Jews never came to Sychar. They thought they were better than everyone else, and so no one liked them. But this man was different.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you knew what God wants to give you, you would ask me for living water,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is water that will fill your life with happiness and never run out.&#8221; The woman remembered all the times she had tried to be happy. But all she had was a sad, sad life. Who could make her happy now?</p>

<p>The man seemed to know all about her life. And most of all, he told her that God wanted her to love Him and obey Him. He could change her life and make her, even her messed-up life, happy. Leaving her water pot, the woman ran back to the village. She forgot all the frowns and loneliness in her excitement. She must tell the others of the man at the well!</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it Jesus?&#8221; asked Sammy when the story was over. &#8220;I think I &#8217;member it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Grandpa with a smile. &#8220;Jesus was the man at the well. And He still wants to give living water to everyone who is thirsty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is &#8216;living water&#8217;?&#8221; asked Edward, who had come in to listen.</p>

<p>&#8220;The kind that is alive!&#8221; said Sammy.</p>

<p>Grandpa chuckled. &#8220;That kind that gives you life,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Jesus will give us His life inside. He can take away all the loneliness and sadness, and brings His love that never runs out. But you have to be thirsty for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edward thought about that. &#8220;You mean, you have to want it a lot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have to want it enough to ask for it, and give up all your own ways to get it. Too many people are drinking in the mud puddles instead of dipping deep in God&#8217;s well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mud puddles? Yuk!&#8221; exclaimed Sammy. &#8220;I want <i>good</i> water to drink!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me, too,&#8221; said Edward.</p>

<h1>The Cat That Came Back</h1>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_22/cat_calling.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="291" /></div>
<p>Jimmy was lying on an old cot out in the orchard, getting some of the nice spring sunshine on his thin body. He had been sickly for a long time and didn&#8217;t often play with the other children. Instead, Jimmy&#8217;s special companion was a dear old cat, Annette. She was nearly as old as he, and ever since they were little they could be found together. The gray cat often curled up next to the pale little boy as he sat reading or studying.</p>

<p>Over the years Annette had lost most of an ear in a winter prowl, but her traveling days were nearly over now. Jimmy noticed that she used her ears much more than her eyes, and that she liked sleeping much longer. But Jimmy adored her anyway. He loved it best when she would join him under the apple trees with her deep purrs.</p>

<p>There was an anxious frown on his face now, and every little while he would turn on his side, look through the orchard, and call, &#8220;Kitty, kitty! Kitty! Annette, come, Ann-ette.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Annette did not come. Jimmy&#8217;s mother came, and sat beside him on the cot. &#8220;Annette is very old indeed, and maybe she won&#8217;t come back again,&#8221; she said after a little while.</p>

<p>&#8220;She was here yesterday, Mother,&#8221; he answered her, and big tears came to his eyes. &#8220;She felt perfectly fine then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, but she&#8217;s an old cat. She never strays away of her own accord, and certainly no one would steal an old blind cat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later on during the day a man came walking up to their house. He introduced himself as the new neighbor who just moved across the little creek. He made inquiries as to where he could buy fresh vegetables and milk. And just as he was about to leave he remarked, &#8220;I did a strange thing early this morning. There was an old cat that came over to my place. One ear was almost gone and it was blind. I&#8217;m not much of a hand to do away with things, but I felt so sorry for that poor old animal that I killed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; With a strangled sob Jimmy quickly left the room. His mother explained to the man that it had been their old pet. He was very sorry, but of course that did not bring her back.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I saw it, I just banged it over the head with a stick and buried it. You will never know how badly I feel about it,&#8221; the man said.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_22/cat_praying.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="344" /></div>
<p>When he was gone, Mother went out to find Jimmy and comfort him. He was out in the orchard on his knees. She knew how much the cat had meant to him, and how much he would miss her. Quietly she went up and knelt beside him, slipping her arm about his shoulder.</p>

<p>He turned to her at once. &#8220;Mother, there&#8217;s something funny about Annette,&#8221; he said, a smile coming to his lips. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been praying and I feel all happy inside. It&#8217;s just as if she wasn&#8217;t dead at all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What would we ever do without our Comforter, son?&#8221; she said. &#8220;The Lord helps us bear our burdens in a wonderful way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say He does. This morning I felt so bad I didn&#8217;t know what to do, and then when that man said&#8212;he had killed Annette,&#8221; and Jimmy&#8217;s voice faltered a little, &#8220;&#8212;I thought I just could not stand it. And here I am happy as anything again. And just because I took it all to Jesus. I think Annette is all right now.&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_22/cat_coming.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="309" /></div>
<p>&#8220;She was very old, son,&#8221; Mother said, patting his arm. &#8220;It would have been much longer anyway. Why&#8212;why&#8212;Jimmy!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Jimmy was running swiftly across the field toward an old blind cat that was staggering in his direction. In a second the gray bundle was in the joyful boy&#8217;s arms. Apparently the new neighbor had only stunned the cat, and so she had dug her way out of the shallow hole and had come home again. And that was the way God had answered little Jimmy&#8217;s prayers.</p>

<p>It was years before Annette really died, and before she did, she presented Jimmy with a very tiny kitten with two whole ears and two very bright eyes. This story might sound strange to you, so perhaps I better add that it is really true.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_22/Sing_a_Song/index.html">Sing a Song</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h2>Something You Can Do</h2>
<p>Do you ever feel like it is easier to frown than to smile? Probably so. Maybe you have to do an extra chore, or you can&#8217;t play like you wanted to. Or, perhaps someone else is having a bad day and you start to &#8220;catch&#8221; their attitude. Gloomy days come to everyone, but there is something you can do about it. You can</p>

<h1>Sing a Song</h1>

<p>Maybe you don&#8217;t need very many instructions to do that! But here are some ideas that you might want to try. They can make singing easier and more fun.</p>

<h2>Make a Song Ring</h2>
<p>You need:</p>

<ul>
<li>3&#8221; x 5&#8221; cards</li>

<li>pens</li>

<li>hole punch</li>

<li>key ring or ribbon</li>

<li>and songs you know</li>

</ul>
<p>Do this: Use different colors (of cards or pens) for different kinds of songs. Maybe blue can be for thankfulness and praise, and yellow for shining for Jesus, and pink for God&#8217;s love. Now write down the songs you know, one on each card. When you are done, stack the different colors together. You can put all the songs on one ring, or make a ring for each kind. Punch a hole in one corner of the cards and tie them together (or slip them on the ring). Now the songs are easy to take with you wherever you go!</p>

<h2>Hide a Song in Your Heart</h2>
<p>You need:</p>

<ul>
<li>a song to learn</li>

<li>someone who knows it</li>

<li>and a ready mind</li>

</ul>
<p>Do this: Pick a song that you want to memorize. Choose one your family knows, or one from <i>Treasures of the Kingdom</i> (you can get a cassette or CD to learn them&#8212;just <a class="www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/contact/?to=totk">email us</a>). Sing the song all the way through as you read the words. Do it again and think about what the words mean. If you sing from your heart, you will be able to remember it better! Now read the first few words of a verse and see if you can sing the rest. Practice singing without looking at the words. If you practice every day, you will soon know it by heart. Now you can use it to bring cheer to your day!</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Why sing? For one thing it helps your mind think on good things. There are many Bible verses that talk about singing to the Lord (see &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_22/Project/index.html">Gems for Your Treasure Chest</a>&#8221;). Songs can help us remember what God has done for us. Songs can help us be willing to work. Songs help us choose what is right. If you don&#8217;t want to sing, ask God to help you. Don&#8217;t wait to feel like singing before you begin!</p>

<h1>The Life-Giver</h1>

<p>Life is a very special thing, isn&#8217;t it? You are glad to be alive, to move, to think, to be loved. Well then, who gave you your life? It wasn&#8217;t just your parents and you just didn&#8217;t appear, because the Bible says that God gives us life. He created Adam and Eve, but He also created you.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_22/center_potter.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="228" /></div>
<p>Since God gave you life, He knows how to help you. If you made something, you would know all about it. And so God knows all about you. He knows how you think and why you are different than your sister or brother. When there is trouble and you are sad, the Life Giver knows why. He cares about you and is ready to help you!</p>

<p>Since God gave you life, He can fix all the hurts. When you are not feeling well, or you hurt yourself, or something goes wrong, take it to God. He made you and knows best of all how you work. The Life Giver can cure any sickness or disease and He knows why you have it. Sometimes He lets us be sick to teach us something. Pray to God, for He is able to make a difference.</p>

<p>Since God gave you life, He wants you to live it right. He is the only one who can change your heart and give you eternal life inside. That is because He is the only one who has that Life to give. Because He loved us, He sent Jesus to show us the way to live. &#8220;I am the life,&#8221; said Jesus. He can give you His Life, too. It is a Life that will fill your heart with peace and joy.</p>

<h1>Guess the Word</h1>

<p>You will find this 6-letter word less than 20 times in the Old Testiment, and only 4 times in the New.</p>

<p>It is a job that uses a wheel.</p>

<p>The ______&#8217;s most important tool is his hands.</p>

<p>Jeremiah the prophet went to see one of them work.</p>

<p>It is another name for the Creator, or &#8220;Life Giver.&#8221;</p>

<h1>In Heavenly Places</h1>

<p>&#8220;Grandpa, don&#8217;t you want to get saved?&#8221; Billy looked at Grandpa&#8217;s bristly white hair and pale rough face as he lay in his easy chair. The old man&#8217;s eyes opened and looked at him sharply.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_22/soldier_hymnal.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="115" /></div>
<p>Billy had come to visit Grandpa and cheer him up. Grandpa couldn&#8217;t walk by himself anymore and he loved to have Billy read or sing to him. And Billy was glad to make his sad face smile. He loved Grandpa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy, I <i>am</i> saved!&#8221; Grandpa replied gruffly. The chair creaked as he tried to sit up. Billy could see that he didn&#8217;t like the question, just like Mother had said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love the Lord,&#8221; Grandpa said quickly, and then made a wheezy sort of sigh. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to heaven.&#8221; But he didn&#8217;t sound too happy.</p>

<p>Billy studied Grandpa with his bright blue eyes. He felt sorry for the old man, who lay so glumly in his chair every day. He wanted to tell him about how glad he was inside because Jesus was his Friend. Jesus would take him to heaven someday, but would He take Grandpa? &#8220;Grandpa, are you really, <i>really</i> sure that you are ready to go to heaven?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_22/soldier_grandpa.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="185" /></div>
<p>The old man looked at the boy and sighed. The shaggy head leaned back and his eyes closed. Billy watched the bushy eyebrows pucker as Grandpa frowned to himself. What was he thinking about? Billy wondered. He put his hand on Grandpa&#8217;s arm and leaned his head on the round shoulder. What could he say?</p>

<p>Suddenly Grandpa&#8217;s head came up. &#8220;All right, Billy,&#8221; he said clearly and strongly, &#8220;just how do you know that you are ready to go to heaven?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy&#8217;s face brightened, and a little smile spread across his lips. He thought of how Jesus had made him so happy when he was so sorry for the bad things he had done. Now he could always talk to Jesus and tell him all his troubles, and Jesus would always help him. To be with Jesus would be wonderful!</p>

<p>&#8220;I used to not be ready,&#8221; Billy said quietly, &#8220;but I began to feel really bad about things I had done that were wrong. I asked Jesus to forgive me. And He did!&#8221; Billy felt so happy that a big smile lit up his face.</p>

<p>Grandpa looked at Billy&#8217;s smile and his face became serious. &#8220;God help me,&#8221; he whispered hoarsely. Billy put his little smooth hand into Grandpa&#8217;s wrinkled one.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pray for you,&#8221; he said softly, and felt the rough fingers squeeze his own.</p>

<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Princess,</p>

<p>Today I am going to tell you a story. So draw your chair up very close and turn your listening ears on high.</p>

<p>This is the story of a little princess who lived a long, long, long time ago. She lived before your mother, and before your father, and before your grandma and grandpa, and your great- grandma and grandpa, too! She was a little girl&#8212;just about your age, I would think. We will call her Sarah. So this is a story about Sarah&#8212;Sarah and her little donkey, Starlight.</p>

<p>Sarah loved Starlight. He was really just a colt, too little to ride, and Sarah looked forward to the day when he would be big enough for her to get on his back. Sometimes she felt impatient for Starlight to grow up&#8212;Sarah could hardly wait to ride him. Papa had said she might ride him first, and this made Sarah feel very grown-up indeed. While she was waiting, Sarah brushed Starlight&#8217;s coat until it shone as bright as a silver spoon. She brushed through his hair and tended carefully to his hooves. Starlight was a happy colt. Why shouldn&#8217;t he be? He had the best mistress in the world!</p>

<p>Many times one neighbor or another would come by and remark to Sarah&#8217;s father that Starlight was a beauty. Often they would offer to buy him. Each time Sarah would stiffen and hold her breath, hoping her father wouldn&#8217;t sell him for some much-needed money. But her father would reply, &#8220;No, neighbor, I cannot accept your kind offer. This colt is my daughter&#8217;s, and it is her very joy.&#8221; Sarah would let out her breath in a long &#8220;whoosh,&#8221; and feel glad that she had such a wonderful father who understood how special Starlight was to her.</p>

<p>One morning, when Sarah was eating her oatmeal and Papa was reading from the Holy Scriptures, Sarah just happened to glance out the window. She was supposed to be listening to Papa, but Sarah was thinking of Starlight and just had to check on him with her eyes. What she saw nearly made her eyes pop out of her head!</p>

<p>Oh! NO! Someone was&#8230;.</p>
