<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Princess,</p>

<p>Today I am going to tell you a story. So draw your chair up very close and turn your listening ears on high.</p>

<p>This is the story of a little princess who lived a long, long, long time ago. She lived before your mother, and before your father, and before your grandma and grandpa, and your great- grandma and grandpa, too! She was a little girl&#8212;just about your age, I would think. We will call her Sarah. So this is a story about Sarah&#8212;Sarah and her little donkey, Starlight.</p>

<p>Sarah loved Starlight. He was really just a colt, too little to ride, and Sarah looked forward to the day when he would be big enough for her to get on his back. Sometimes she felt impatient for Starlight to grow up&#8212;Sarah could hardly wait to ride him. Papa had said she might ride him first, and this made Sarah feel very grown-up indeed. While she was waiting, Sarah brushed Starlight&#8217;s coat until it shone as bright as a silver spoon. She brushed through his hair and tended carefully to his hooves. Starlight was a happy colt. Why shouldn&#8217;t he be? He had the best mistress in the world!</p>

<p>Many times one neighbor or another would come by and remark to Sarah&#8217;s father that Starlight was a beauty. Often they would offer to buy him. Each time Sarah would stiffen and hold her breath, hoping her father wouldn&#8217;t sell him for some much-needed money. But her father would reply, &#8220;No, neighbor, I cannot accept your kind offer. This colt is my daughter&#8217;s, and it is her very joy.&#8221; Sarah would let out her breath in a long &#8220;whoosh,&#8221; and feel glad that she had such a wonderful father who understood how special Starlight was to her.</p>

<p>One morning, when Sarah was eating her oatmeal and Papa was reading from the Holy Scriptures, Sarah just happened to glance out the window. She was supposed to be listening to Papa, but Sarah was thinking of Starlight and just had to check on him with her eyes. What she saw nearly made her eyes pop out of her head!</p>

<p>Oh! NO! Someone was&#8230;.</p>
