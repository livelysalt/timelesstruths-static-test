<h1>Purpose of <i>Foundation Truth</i></h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Folks,</p>

<p>Greetings in the name of Jesus, our Friend and Redeemer, who gave Himself for us, the guiltless for the guilty, that we might be saved.
Without Him, we can do nothing, but by Him, we can do all things He wants us to do (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+4%3A13">Philippians 4:13</a>).
</p>

<p>We are leaning heavily on the Lord to help us in this task. We want to be of assistance to those who desire to live for God and make heaven their home, and we want to work with the Holy Spirit in stirring and awakening all others to the great necessity of doing so.</p>

<p>That is the purpose of this publication. If we can, by God&#8217;s help, be of usefulness to even one soul, then all labor and effort will be more than repaid.</p>

<p>Now we wish to state that we love everyone, even the vast majority of you whom we have not met. How can we say this? With joy, and an inward assurance, I can declare it because
<span class="scripture">&#8220;the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+5%3A5" title="Romans 5:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 5:5)</span></a></span>
There is no one, at all, whom we resent, or to whom we bear a grudge. We do not have it &#8220;in&#8221; for anyone, nor are we offended at anyone.</p>

<p>A brother once remarked to someone he had never met before that he had a past acquaintance with them of a sort. Then he explained that he was acquainted with God, and God was acquainted with them, and so he had a sort of indirect acquaintance with them. It is because God knows you and loves you, dear reader, that we venture to write and hope. He is able to give what is needed.</p>

<p>We are but fellow pilgrims on the narrow way, rejoicing in our freedom and walking in the light that has shone upon our pathway.
There are things we are persuaded of (deeply) that accompany salvation (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+6%3A9">Hebrews 6:9</a>),
and there are things that we are not certain about. But our trust is in God. He has brought us safely thus far, and we trust Him to lead us safely home.</p>

<p>We could outline a list of what we are convicted of in our heart and a list of questions which occur to our mind. But I am not convinced that it would be profitable for you or for us to do so. Why? In God&#8217;s great plan of guidance and correction, you may not be at the same lesson junctures. It may not make sense at this time, although it may be just what you need at another time. We are asking the Lord to guide us. We are asking Him to hover over the paper as you read it and to assist you in getting hold of what is relevant and profitable, spiritually, to you at the time you read it.</p>

<p>If you feel it is necessary for you to know exactly where we stand on a particular principle, please contact us. Write us or call. But, if you read the paper over an extended period of time, we feel certain you will know, and we trust and hope that it will be of benefit to you.</p>

<p><b>To properly understand the Bible, it is necessary to be under the same Holy Spirit that inspired it to be written.</b> With Brother John, we must be
<span class="scripture">&#8220;in the Spirit&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelations+1%3A10" title="Revelations 1:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelations 1:10)</span></a></span>
to see and know and understand.
Only the Lord can enlighten the eyes of our understanding (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+1%3A18">Ephesians 1:18</a>),
and give skill and understanding (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Daniel+9%3A22%3B+1%3A17">Daniel 9:22; 1:17</a>).
The Lord will teach us to rightly divide the Word of Truth, producing a workman that needeth not to be ashamed (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A15">II&nbsp;Timothy 2:15</a>).
</p>

<p>Having been taught in this way by this wonderful Teacher for some time, we declare with great joy that we are
<span class="scripture">&#8220;not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+1%3A16" title="Romans 1:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 1:16)</span></a></span>
We would happily shout to all the glorious news: <b>IT WORKS!</b> It does just exactly as promised. Not a single part has failed in any way. Hallelujah! It is gloriously true and accurate. In spite of all who have failed to find, the treasure is yet in the field,
and there are those who have paid the full price to buy the same, and are rejoicing in full possession (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+13%3A44">Matthew 13:44</a>).
</p>

<p>If you have been hindered&#8212;if you are disillusioned&#8212;if you are hurt&#8212;bewildered&#8212;confused&#8212;desperate&#8212;in great need&#8212;we would declare to you the results of our own personal experience with God and His way: <b>IT WORKS!</b> And we would say to you, &#8220;Lift up your head. Look and live. <b>It was designed by God Himself to work in your case.</b>&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;For me the promise sure was made,<br />And sealed on Calvary.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/The_Unchanging_Word/index.html" title="The Unchanging Word">*</a></p>

<p>Finally, we ask an interest in your prayers.
Ye who love the Lord, would you help hold up our hands? (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Exodus+17%3A8-13">Exodus 17:8-13</a>).

<h1>Discussion</h1>

<div class="blurb">
<h3>Arminianism: Free-Will, or, Human Ability</h3>
<p>Although human nature was seriously affected by the fall, man has not been left in a state of total spiritual helplessness. God graciously enables every sinner to repent and believe, but He does not interfere with man&#8217;s freedom. Each sinner possesses a free will, and his eternal destiny depends on how he uses it. Man&#8217;s freedom consists of his ability to choose good over evil in spiritual matters; his will is not enslaved to his sinful nature. The sinner has the power to either cooperate with God&#8217;s Spirit and be regenerated or resist God&#8217;s grace and perish. The lost sinner needs the Spirit&#8217;s assistance, but he does not have to be regenerated by the Spirit before he can believe, for faith is man&#8217;s act and precedes the new birth. Faith is the sinner&#8217;s gift to God; it is man&#8217;s contribution to salvation.</p>

<h3>Calvinism: Total Inability, or, Total Depravity</h3>
<p>Because of the fall, man is unable of himself to savingly believe the gospel. The sinner is dead, blind, and deaf to the things of God; his heart is deceitful and desperately corrupt. His will is not free, it is in bondage to his evil nature, therefore, he will not indeed he cannot choose good over evil in the spiritual realm. Consequently, it takes much more than the Spirit&#8217;s assistance to bring a sinner to Christ it takes regeneration by which the Spirit makes the sinner alive and gives him a new nature. Faith is not something man contributes to salvation but is itself a part of God&#8217;s gift of salvation&#8212;it is God&#8217;s gift to the sinner, not the sinner&#8217;s gift to God.</p>

</div>


<h2>Arminianism</h2>
<p>Let us start with the creation of man. What was man like before the fall? The scriptures tell us that
<span class="scripture">&#8220;<b>So God created man in his own image</b>, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+1%3A27" title="Genesis 1:27"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 1:27)</span></a></span>
This image of God is identified in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+3%3A10">Colossians 3:10</a>, <span class="scripture">&#8220;And have put on the new man, which is <b>renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him</b>,&#8221;</span> and <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+4%3A24">Ephesians 4:24</a>, <span class="scripture">&#8220;And that ye put on the new man, <b>which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness</b>.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>The fall into sin was a change in the moral nature of man. We read, <span class="scripture">&#8220;That ye put off concerning the former conversation <b>the old man, which is corrupt</b> according to the deceitful lusts.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+4%3A22" title="Ephesians 4:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 4:22)</span></a></span> Man was not created with this corrupt nature, for <span class="scripture">&#8220;God created man in his own image.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+1%3A27" title="Genesis 1:27"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 1:27)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Lo, this only have I found, that <b>God hath made man upright</b>; but they have sought out many inventions.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ecclesiastes+7%3A29" title="Ecclesiastes 7:29"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ecclesiastes 7:29)</span></a></span>
Please note that it is possible for this corruptible, fallen nature, according to the deceitful lusts, to be restored to the original purity. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him.&#8221;</span> The prophet David, looking ahead to the grace of God that bringeth salvation, stated,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;He restoreth my soul.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+23%3A3" title="Psalm 23:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 23:3)</span></a></span>
Thank the Lord for the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness!</p>

<p>We can see immediately that the old nature is not obliterated or annihilated, but it is corrupted. Just as physical death is not obliteration or annihilation, but a separation of the inner man and the outer (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Kings+17%3A21%3B+Genesis+35%3A18">I&nbsp;Kings 17:21; Genesis 35:18</a>), so spiritual death is not obliteration or annihilation either, but the <i>separation</i> of the soul of man from God by sin. Adam and Eve died inside that day in the Garden of Eve, for their sin separated between them and God.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But <b>your iniquities have separated between you and your God</b>, and your sins have hid his face from you, that He will not hear.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+59%3A2" title="Isaiah 59:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 59:2)</span></a></span>
As long as there was no sin in Adam and Eve, there was no separation (death) between them and God, and they walked and talked with God day after day. But when they died, spiritually, by sinning, an awful change took place in them. They were aware of what happened to them, and they feared the presence of the Lord. Far from being insensitive to the voice of God, they remembered it all too well and <i>hid</i>. The problem was not that they were not aware of God anymore; it was that they were <i>out of harmony</i> with God in their now defiled natures.</p>

<p>The conscience of Adam bothered him, and the conscience of Eve bothered her. Even though their natures were defiled by sin, and they were dead in trespasses and sins, <i>they hid</i>. Here the words of Paul speak with great authority:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: Which show <b>the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness</b>, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another; In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+2%3A14-16" title="Romans 2:14-16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 2:14-16)</span></a></span>
The consciences of Adam and Eve accused them. The conclusion is inescapable: God has preserved a certain thing in the hearts of fallen men, namely, <span class="scripture">&#8220;the work of the law written in their hearts,&#8221;</span> which was not eradicated by the fall. Their consciences bear witness, their thoughts accusing or excusing one another, even though they are dead in trespasses and sins.</p>

<p>Now, no man has ever yet been saved by his conscience or ever will be, and it is possible to sear the conscience so that it is very weak and ineffective (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+4%3A2">I&nbsp;Timothy 4:2</a>). But note that not all who are dead in trespasses and sins have seared their conscience. Again, the conclusion is inescapable: sinful man has a mechanism in him, placed by God, which produces an awareness of right and wrong and condemns or approves accordingly. The conscience may not be accurate as is necessary for holy living, but it goes about its God-appointed task as best it can. When an individual is saved, and their nature is changed, their conscience reflects the change, as well.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of <b>a good conscience</b>.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+1%3A5" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 1:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 1:5)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Holding faith, and <b>a good conscience</b>; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+1%3A19" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 1:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 1:19)</span></a></span>&#8221;
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For <b>our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience</b>, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+1%3A12" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 1:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 1:12)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>We see this God-given capability (given to all men) working in the folks who accused the woman of adultery before Jesus.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;They which heard it, <b>being convicted by their own conscience</b>, went out one by one.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+8%3A9" title="John 8:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 8:9)</span></a></span>
You may say, &#8220;Well, it was God talking to them, and that made the difference.&#8221; Yes, but He was speaking through that way that He had placed within them­-the conscience. They were convicted by their own conscience. These men were some of the Lord&#8217;s opposers, who did not have ears to hear. But, <i>they were convicted by their own conscience</i>. The problem was not that they did not see. The problem was that they did not yield and act according to their conviction. Instead, they went out, one by one. Their thoughts were accusing them and telling them that they were wrong and needed help, but they left.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways. Nevertheless he <b>left not himself without witness</b>, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+14%3A16-17" title="Acts 14:16-17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 14:16-17)</span></a></span>
The reader can see at a glance that the nature of fallen man, dead (separated) in trespasses and sins, still has a certain sensibility toward the workings and doings of God. A man in sin can experience a certain gratitude for God&#8217;s goodness, the rain and fruitful seasons, and these can fill his unsaved heart with food and gladness, <i>for God has not left Himself without witness.</i> When we read the words of the Psalmist,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+19%3A13" title="Psalm 19:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 19:13)</span></a></span>
we realize that God is continually talking to all men, everywhere, and <i>the appointed voice is heard by all.</i> It certainly is not understood correctly all the time, yet God has not left Himself without witness. It all nudges man in the right direction, if he will hear it. All mankind is surrounded by the goodness of God. Men are not oblivious to these divine influences in their lives; they are greatly hindered from getting a hold on them because of sin. But they all bring a merciful influence to bear.</p>

<p>Note the understanding of the Apostle Paul as he preaches to the folks at Athens,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; Neither is worshipped with men&#8217;s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things; And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; That they should seek the Lord, <b>if haply they might feel after him, and find him,</b> though he be not far from every one of us: For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+17%3A24-28" title="Acts 17:24-28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 17:24-28)</span></a></span>
Notice first the universality of Brother Paul&#8217;s statements. He includes all who are given life, breath, and everything else; yes, all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth. Could words more emphatically express the fact that Paul was speaking of all men? And what was he stating about everyone? <span class="scripture">&#8220;That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might <i>feel</i> after Him, and find Him, though He be not far from every one of us.&#8221;</span> Could words more accurately express what Brother Paul knew, that God has made a way for <i>all men to seek after Him and find Him</i>? That God has given unsaved men, who know Him not, the capacity to <i>feel after Him</i>? Brother Paul knew that the Spirit of God strives with all men everywhere and that God was not far from every one of us, therefore he was encouraging all who would to start feeling after God that they might find Him.</p>

<p>Now this fact has great implications. Every time the Lord deals with us, we are either the better for it (if we yield) or the worse (if we resist). Therefore, God can control how hardened we are or not, by how He deals with us. Because He knows all about us and reads the condition of our heart as an open book, He understands what will happen to us if He deals in such and such a manner with us in any given way. Therefore, <i>without arbitrarily overriding our given ability to choose,</i> He can, by the manner and frequency of His dealing, affect our heart&#8217;s condition indirectly. It is rather like dealing with a child with a certain disposition. Because you are a discerning adult, and can project fairly accurately what his/her reaction will be, you can deal with the child in such a manner as to calm him or make him mad. And this can happen without you actually taking away from him his ability to choose how he responds.</p>

<p>The Lord spoke in parables to those who were outside <i>in complete accordance with the choice that they <b>had already made</b> to reject truth and light.</i> Their response to God&#8217;s prior dealings with them put them in a fearful situation, namely,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;that seeing, they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+4%3A12" title="Mark 4:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 4:12)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+4%3A25" title="Mark 4:25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 4:25)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, <b>that they which see not might see</b>; and that they which see might be made blind.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+9%3A39" title="John 9:39"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 9:39)</span></a></span>
How dangerous it is to reject or trifle with God&#8217;s dealings with you! It can cause you to lose what perceptiveness you have (as a result of God&#8217;s mercy to you), and you can end up being unable to perceive at all and to find forgiveness, the dealings of the Lord becoming a perfect mystery to you and your doom certain!</p>

<p>But note that this condition was a stage in a progression of their rejection of God&#8217;s dealings with their heart. They had not always been in that condition, but had reached it by hardening themselves through resistance to the Holy Spirit striving with their heart. Truly,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+28%3A14" title="Proverbs 28:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 28:14)</span></a></span>
God has given to man the fearsome and weighty responsibility that comes from the ability to harden our own heart, and He, by His dealing with us, can take advantage of that fact to indirectly harden our heart by the way that He deals with us, while still leaving us with the solemn responsibility of giving account for our own choices.</p>

<p>Truly,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+6%3A44" title="John 6:44"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 6:44)</span></a></span>
Both our brother of the opposing position and ourselves believe that our need is such that God must help us, else we are lost. Where we differ is this: we believe that the Bible teaches that God deals with all men, sufficient to fix responsibility, and that He hath allowed all men the right to choose, to accept life or death, by either yielding to His entreaties or rejecting them. Here the scriptures speak with great authority,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to usward, <b>not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</b>&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+3%3A9" title="II&nbsp;Peter 3:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 3:9)</span></a></span>
And lest we should think that this applies only to a certain group of mankind, the inspired record states &#8220;that all should come to repentance,&#8221; yea,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;now commandeth all men every where to repent.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+17%3A30" title="Acts 17:30"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 17:30)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Who will have <b>all men to be saved</b>, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+2%3A4" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 2:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 2:4)</span></a></span>
Who can read these plain declarations of the desire and will of God without realizing that God loves everybody, wants everybody, and is doing all He can within the limits that He Himself has imposed on Himself and His creation to get everybody to repent, be forgiven, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth? Nor have we scarcely begun to even touch on the multitude of scriptures that bear on this point, for
<span class="scripture">&#8220;that he by the grace of God <b>should taste death for every man.</b>&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+2%3A9" title="Hebrews 2:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 2:9)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if <b>one died for all</b>, then were <b>all dead</b>: And that <b>he died for all</b>, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+5%3A14-15" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 5:14-15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 5:14-15)</span></a></span>
He died for all, so that all <i>could</i> be saved, but the Apostle Paul readily recognized that only a certain number of the <i>all</i> for whom the blood was shed would live, because only a few would choose to walk the narrow way.</p>

<h2>Calvinism</h2>
<p>There are many facets and implications of the view some people call &#8220;the predestination view.&#8221; For those that haven&#8217;t had the opportunity to ponder at length upon these theological issues, I think it most profitable to start by saying that all believers must believe in predestination by some definition. The scriptures use this word,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;having predestined us to adoption as sons&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+1%3A5" title="Ephesians 1:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 1:5)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New King James Version">NKJV</span>;
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For whom He foreknew, He also predestined.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+3%3A29" title="Romans 3:29"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 3:29)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New King James Version">NKJV</span> We cannot deny the term, but proceed to define what we mean as accurately as possible. Two of the most common views might say this: First, God predestined individuals. Secondly, God predestined either the means of salvation or believers in general, not in particular.</p>

<p>I think the very crux of the issue between &#8220;Calvinism&#8221; and &#8220;Arminianism&#8221; is our presuppositions regarding our understanding of God and man. These two positions, as they unfold, start using terms that most are familiar with, &#8220;The Sovereignty of God&#8221; and &#8220;The Free-will of Man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before entering into the &#8220;Sovereignty/Free-will&#8221; realm, I must begin with my view of what the scriptures say about man&#8217;s condition. I see that we are Dead:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+5%3A12" title="Romans 5:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 5:12)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New King James Version">NKJV</span>
For, as God commanded our first parents,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+2%3A17" title="Genesis 2:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 2:17)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New King James Version">NKJV</span>
We know that they did not die physically &#8220;that day&#8221; but that they did spiritually. We do know however, that their bodies did start dying that day, but that is because of the effects that sin had upon their bodies.</p>

<p>We are also Blind and Deaf: <span class="scripture">&#8220;And he said to them, &#8216;To you it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to those who are outside, all things come in parables, so that, &#8220;Seeing they may see and not perceive, And hearing they may hear and not understand; Lest they should turn, And their sins be forgiven.&#8221; ' &#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+4%3A11-12" title="Mark 4:11-12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 4:11-12)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New King James Version">NKJV</span> This &#8220;limiting&#8221; statement follows what Jesus had just said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;He who has ears to hear, let him hear.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+4%3A9" title="Mark 4:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 4:9)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New King James Version">NKJV</span> This shows the general call to repentance and belief, but only the &#8220;hearing&#8221; or &#8220;seeing&#8221; will be forgiven.</p>

<p>This leads into the next point, we are Uninstructable:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+2%3A14" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 2:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 2:14)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New King James Version">NKJV</span>
Paul, in his letter to the Romans, quotes from the Psalms to give us his understanding of the unregenerate man,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;There is none righteous, no, not one; There is none who understands; There is none who seeks after God. They have all turned aside; They have together become unprofitable; There is none who does good, no, not one.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+3%3A10-12" title="Romans 3:10-12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 3:10-12)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New King James Version">NKJV</span>
Paul here is not saying that all men are as evil as they can be, but is saying that man is evil in all areas of life. Even &#8220;good&#8221; men are at enmity against God. Even many men that prophesy in His name, or cast out demons in His name, or do many wonders in His name are never known of God, and are still viewed as practicing lawlessness (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matt.+7%3A21-23">Matt. 7:21-23</a>).</p>

<p>The question then becomes, where do we go from here? Can we save ourselves? <span class="scripture">&#8220;Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? No one&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Job+14%3A4" title="Job 14:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Job 14:4)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New King James Version">NKJV</span>!

Jesus said to the Pharisees, <span class="scripture">&#8220;You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do&#8230;. He who is of God hears God&#8217;s words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+8%3A44%2C47" title="John 8:44,47"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 8:44,47)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New King James Version">NKJV</span> Are not God&#8217;s words, &#8220;Believe in Me&#8221;? Are not God&#8217;s words, &#8220;Have faith&#8221;? But only His sheep hear His voice (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+10%3A3">John 10:3</a>). The call goes out to all, but all will not come. Only His sheep, or His children, will follow Him and do His works.</p>

<p><a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+3">John 3</a> gives us the beautiful illustration of this. Many may point to 3:16 which says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+3%3A16" title="John 3:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 3:16)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New King James Version">NKJV</span> But, the context is completely ignored. <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+3%3A18">Verse 18</a> says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.&#8221;</span><span class="script_ver" title="New King James Version">NKJV</span> From this statement we can go two different directions. One, all we have to do is start believing and we will &#8220;get saved.&#8221; Or, &#8220;Believers&#8221; are not condemned, and those that are condemned have been condemned all along because they have not believed.</p>

<p>This is a very subtle difference but becomes very clear in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+3%3A19-21">verses 19 to 21</a>, <span class="scripture">&#8220;And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God.&#8221;</span><span class="script_ver" title="New King James Version">NKJV</span> We are either attracted to the light or repulsed by it. Coming to the light is a &#8220;good thing&#8221; and can only be done in the Spirit (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A9">Romans 8:9</a>). No one seeks after God that is repulsed by the light (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+3%3A10-12">Romans 3:10-12</a>). God raises the dead and makes the blind to see. We &#8220;believe&#8221; because and after we are made alive and see. Then we follow the Great Shepherd.</p>

<h1>The Spirit of Unbelief</h1>

<p>Unbelief is a choice that men make. It does not present itself as a choice, however; it shows itself as a necessity, an inevitability, the only way that is truly honest and objective. That is a lie, but those who are deceived by this spirit perceive it not for what it truly is&#8212;a grim imposition foisted on the human heart by the father of all deception.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+53%3A1" title="Psalm 53:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 53:1)</span></a></span>
You will notice that the statement of unbelief, &#8220;There is no God,&#8221; is stated in the heart. Someone has stated that the fool says this in his heart without the full consent of his mind, <i>for if it be difficult to prove by human reasoning that there <b>is</b> a God, <b>it is utterly impossible to prove that there is not.</b></i> So the statement of unbelief is said in the heart. Those who choose the path of unbelief choose to have faith in unbelief. It becomes their religion to doubt and be skeptical. They choose to believe in unbelief.</p>

<p>Most people make this choice without a full and impartial investigation of the facts. Quite often they are persuaded to put their faith in a religion of no faith before they are old enough to even began to make anything like a fair investigation. Besides, they are surrounded by the prophets and theologians of unbelief. For in the perilous times in which we live, our world is awash in unbelief. It is an age of unbelief, i.e., an age of paganism revived. This attitude of misplaced faith is everywhere, both in brazen, confrontational form and in subtle, commonly-assumed guise.</p>

<p>We have before us a recent copy of <i>U.S. News and World Reports</i>, the July 3, 2000 issue. In an article entitled, &#8220;The next big thing is small,&#8221; the author outlines the development of nano technology. Nano technology is the manipulation of microscopic things to change the nature and structure of things that are visible. &#8220;Nanoparticles also help make car and floor waxes that are harder and more durable and eyeglasses that are less likely to scratch. As these examples show, one huge advantage of nanotech is its ability to create materials with novel properties not found in nature or obtainable through conventional chemistry&#8221; (pp. 32). So far, this is a news items of actual and verifiable developments. But then, on the same page, we have this: &#8220;The next stage in the development of nanotechnology borrows a page from nature. Building a supercomputer no bigger than a speck of dust might seem an impossible task, <i>until one realizes that evolution solved such problems more than a billion years ago.</i> Living cells contain all sorts of nanoscale motors made of proteins that perform myraid mechanical and chemical functions, from muscle contraction to photosynthesis. In some instances, such motors may be re-engineered, or imitated, to produce products and processes useful to humans&#8221; (emphasis added).</p>

<p>Now this statement regarding evolution is a religious statement, an article of faith with a large portion of the scientific community. It has become an article of faith with a large number of the well-educated portion of the population, as well. <i>It is a statement of faith</i>&#8212;no one was there billions of years ago, and no one can verify such a thing. It is a theory, full of large and serious questions and doubtful assumptions, which does not deserve the faith that is placed in it. A great deal of wishful thinking is involved. The &#8220;evidence&#8221; does not prove the theory. Many of its most blatant conclusions are hidden in a mysterious vocabulary and jargon which are difficult for the uninitiated to perceive.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of <b>science falsely so called</b>: Which some professing have erred concerning the faith.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+6%3A20-21" title="1 Timothy 6:20-21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (1 Timothy 6:20-21)</span></a></span>
This religion, falsely called science, is a misrepresentation. It has its high priests, its devotees, and it demands its sacrifices. It propagates its myths and legends. The scriptures characterize it as profane (characterized by irreverence or contempt for God or sacred things) and vain babblings.</p>

<p>The religion of science-falsely-so-called does not own up to this characterization, of course. They demand respect, presenting their activities as unbiased, objective, and compelling. They are not nearly as objective as they like to believe about themselves. Especially do they resist anything that would bring them to conclude that there is anything beyond the physical realities. Their creed teaches them to be distrustful of anything spiritual. That the world was created by God from nothing at all is anathema to them.</p>

<p>A small number of scientists, despised and persecuted by the others, have examined the same evidence and reached entirely different conclusions. They have not received the same spirit of unbelief that so greatly influences the majority. They are not prejudiced in the same manner. So they are regarded as heretical, as betrayers of the creed.</p>

<p>The religion of science-falsely-so-called contains such fantastic, even ridiculous, stretches of faith. In all fairness, it could be truly said that it takes more faith to believe certain accounts of so-called science than to believe the Word of God.</p>

<p>To an evolutionist, time solves all problems. But the man who puts his faith in this false creed does not stop to consider that what evolves must first be involved. That is, within the simplest and most basic form of life must be contained the most advanced qualities, somehow. The mental ability of Einstein must be in the original, primitive cell, somehow, if I reject creationism. This is fantastic faith (though false), a faith in luck, in chance, augmented by an incredible imagination of time.</p>

<p>If ten million monkeys, all banging on ten million typewriters for ten million years were to somehow produce the Gettysburg Address that Abraham Lincoln spoke, then maybe the evolutionists might have a point, but it is preposterous! How fantastical is the faith of the adherents of this false religion!</p>

<p>But this is typical of the spirit of unbelief. At the bottom of this path that men take is the ignoring of uncongenial truth.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+1%3A21" title="Romans 1:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 1:21)</span></a></span>
Being unwilling to give God the glory and partaking of the spirit of ingratitude. That is, not wanting to acknowledge our place in the grand scheme of things that God created, thus being unwilling to humble ourselves and unappreciative of God&#8217;s goodness, we open ourselves to the spirit of unbelief. It produces vanity in the imagination and darkens the foolish heart. The poor fool who walks this path says in his heart,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;there is no God,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+1%3A28" title="Hebrews 1:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 1:28)</span></a></span>
not because he can prove it or even come close to proving it, but because he wants it to be that way!</p>

<br />To quench the only ray that cheered the earth,

<br />Unpardonable man! sold under sin!
<br />He was the devil&#8217;s pioneer, who cut

<h1>Book Reviews</h1>

<hr class="minor" />
<h2>Wiring Simplified</h2>
<p class="author">H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan</p>

<p>ISBN 0-9603294-6-3 38th edition (182 pages), published by Park Publishing, Inc.</p>

<p>This is a practical handbook on electrical wiring. Let me quote from the back cover: &#8220;Learn how to install wiring in your home so it is both safe and practical. This is the 38th edition of one of the first do-it-yourself manuals, and it is based on the latest 1996 National Electrical Code with all the most recent safety provisions.&#8221;</p>

<p>I found this book very useful as I have had some recent home wiring projects (see the article to the young men, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_3/I_Write_unto_You/index.html">I Write unto You</a>&#8221; in this issue). The book can be read and studied through, as a means of getting familiar with the whole subject of electrical matters about the home or farm, or individual chapters serve as very useful reference material. In my project, I found sections on wire sizes and types, circuit breakers and circuits very valuable, including the many illustrations (there are over 200 in the book). Rather than attempt an in-depth review, let me list the chapter titles:</p>

<ul>
<li>Standards, Codes and Safety</li>

<li>Make a &#8220;Good Buy&#8221; in Your Electrical Installation</li>

<li>Measurement of Electricity</li>

<li>Wire Sizes and Types</li>

<li>Fuses, Circuit Breakers and Circuits</li>

<li>Circuit Basics</li>

<li>Importance of Grounding</li>

<li>The Service Entrance</li>

<li>Three Wiring Systems</li>

<li>Nonmetallic Sheathed Cable</li>

<li>Armored Cable</li>

<li>Conduit</li>

<li>Miscellaneous Wiring</li>

<li>Wiring of Heavy Appliances</li>

<li>Finishing an Installation</li>

<li>Old Work: Modernizing</li>

<li>Farm Wiring</li>

<li>Electric Motors</li>

<li>Troubleshooting</li>

</ul>
<p>I found the book at a local hardware store for $6.95. I recommend it for anyone needing a handbook to help them get started with doing electrical work around their homes.</p>

<h2>The Neck of the Giraffe: Where Darwin Went Wrong</h2>
<p>Francis Hitching</p>

<p>Published by Ticknor and Fields, 1982</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">The mystery of how life began, and then proliferated into the myriad forms on Earth today, is one that crosses the barriers of science, religion, and philosophy. For many years now, as we shall see, it has been taken for granted that Darwin had solved the question once and for all. But had he? When I began to look beyond the orthodox textbook explanations, I found many scientists with private doubts; rather fewer who had come out with them in public; and a handful who went so far as to say that Darwinian evolutionary theory had turned out not to be scientific theory at all.</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[pp. 7-8]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p class="first">The touchstone of neo-Darwinian theory is that evolution results from the natural selection of small, accidental, cumulative changes. Logically, then, the fossil record ought to show this stately progression. If we find fossils at all, and if Darwin&#8217;s theory was right, we can predict what the rocks should contain: finely graduated fossils leading from one group of creatures to another group of creatures at a higher level of complexity. The minor &#8220;improvements&#8221; in successive generations should be as readily preserved as the species themselves. But this isn&#8217;t so. In the fact the opposite is the case, as Darwin himself complained.</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[pp. 17]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p class="first">But the curious thing is that there is a consistency about the fossil gaps: the fossils are missing in all the important places.</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[pp. 19]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>This exceedingly interesting book takes a long, hard look at the theory of natural selection, the theory propagated by Charles Darwin that all life evolved from one focal point into all the species that have existed and do exist. The author is not a Creationist, and even believes that evolution between species has occurred. The value of his writing is in the valid questions that are raised about the whole idea. I found it tedious in places and disagreed with the author in many of his conclusions. But I found the points of question that he discussed most fascinating.</p>

<p>&#8220;Darwin also has a beguiling way of making you think he has faced up to all the objections to his theory, and overcome them&#8221; (pg. 251). Yes, I agree that the theory is beguiling and convenient to people who wish to believe the same. The Bible is written in such a way that its great treasure of wisdom and instruction is hid from the wise and prudent and revealed to babes. The record of truth that is written in creation was established by One who
<span class="scripture">&#8220;taketh the wise in their own craftiness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+3%3A19" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 3:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 3:19)</span></a></span>
This book, <i>The Neck of the Giraffe</i>, offers more evidence of that fact.</p>

<p>C. E. Orr</p>

<p>This booklet, full of bite-sized nuggets of truth, will encourage and challenge young and mature Christians alike. As the title suggests, Bro. Orr&#8217;s burden is to stir his brethren to deeper, holier living&#8212;i.e., to be not just hearers of the Word, but doers also. He says in his introduction:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">You need to pray more, meditate more, lift up your soul to God more, have more reverence and holy awe upon your soul, live more in godly fear, have more of the anointing of the Holy Spirit upon you, and more peace and power and glory in your soul. You can have it. It will cost you something, but you can have it if you will. We love you fervently. We want to help you. We promise you and God that by His grace we will live just what we preach to you. Our hearts are burdened. Too many of God&#8217;s saints are living beneath their privilege.</p>

<p>Are you living beneath your privilege? Are you finding peace and joy and satisfaction within? If you are stirred to seek a closer walk with God, this book is sure to be an encouragement and help to you.</p>

<h1>&#8220;I Write Unto You, Young Men&#8221;</h1>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first"><span class="scripture">&#8220;I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+2%3A14" title="I&nbsp;John 2:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 2:14)</span></a></span></p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Young Men,</p>

<p>I want to write to you this time about an experience that has helped me a lot, and I hope it will be a benefit to you as well.</p>

<p>We had recently built a greenhouse/sun room addition onto our house (you might find &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_1/Paying_the_Price/index.html" title="Foundation Truth 1/Paying the Price">Paying the Price: The Greenhouse Story</a>&#8221; in the Winter 2000 issue of some interest), and now we needed to set up electrical service to this room. In the past, I had leaned pretty heavily on my neighbor, who is an electrician, for help with electrical work around our house, and although he had explained several times to me how to do simple electrical wiring, it just wouldn&#8217;t stick in my mind. I could tell that he was eager for me to learn how to do my own wiring work, and I knew it would be valuable to know, so I set out to learn in earnest. I asked questions, I bought a book about electric wiring (there is a <a href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_3/Book_Reviews/index.html">book review</a> on it in this issue), and I set myself to the task. The project involved installing an additional service box, a switch, a light fixture, six outlets in the greenhouse and one on the outside, three outlets in the family room adjoining, and a fluorescent light in the girls&#8217; bedroom. The previous summer when we were re-roofing, I had installed (but hadn&#8217;t connected to electricity) two attic ventilators, so these were a part of the project as well. Since I was paying a fee for the permit already, I added to the project four outlets on our back porch.</p>

<p>Now each of us has those things that come easily to us, and those things that only come with great difficulty or are trials and vexations to our spirit. I am greatly encouraged by the statement that Brother James makes in his letter, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+5%3A17" title="James 5:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 5:17)</span></a></span> It goes on to speak of how he earnestly prayed, and God heard his prayers to stop the rain for three and a half years, and then heard his prayers to make it rain again. This man of God, through whom many and great miracles were wrought, was simply a vessel with all the humanity each of us has. I, who write to you, am also a man &#8220;subject to like passions&#8221; as you, and you will see some of them here.</p>

<p>With some assistance from my son, I spent a Saturday morning working away&#8212;crawling in the attic amongst the insulation and roofing nails poking through, drilling holes in the ceiling and walls, stringing wire and tacking it up, removing sections of plywood from the family room wall, and so on. I constantly was facing decisions that seemed far above my wisdom and wits to determine, encountering unexpected obstacles, wondering if it would ever get finished. I became tense and strained. As I told my mother, when she visited that afternoon, I felt like running off somewhere and screaming (see the passions?). It felt awful and overwhelming. I felt like quitting. It had all the classic elements of a spiritual trial!</p>

<p>I took the afternoon off, both from necessity (visitors) and because I knew my nerves were shot. I committed my feelings and the pressures I felt and the unsolved problems to the Lord. Several days later I tackled it again. A couple days later, again, and so on it went. Eventually everything was connected, although in several of the outlets I could barely cram the wires and wire nuts in the box behind the receptacle. It didn&#8217;t work right, but my neighbor quickly found the problem and showed me how to arrange the wires better so they fit in the box a little easier. When I hooked up the light in the girl&#8217;s room, it was supposed to operate on the switch, but I had connected it wrong so that the light was automatically on. It took another trip to the attic and some rewiring before that worked. In the end, we had an operational system, but the blessings had just begun!</p>

<p>A project to rewire in my barn and shop had been waiting for me for two years. All the lighting and outlets had been on a single circuit, and any time we ran a power tool, the lights dimmed. Now I took on the project of rewiring to put the outlets on two different circuits and the lights on a third circuit. It took me awhile, and I ran into problems, but now I could confidently take each one on and keep going, knowing that the victory was sure in the end.</p>

<p>I then needed to take down my old wellhouse and put up a new one, and the pump circuit and outlets there had to be reconnected with some rewiring. When I finished, the well worked, but the additional outlets didn&#8217;t. I was able to find and fix the problem in a few minutes!</p>

<p>Now, my dear young friends, I am writing this to you with two applications in mind.</p>

<p>The first concerns your future roles as problem-solvers around your homes. Some of you are already ahead of me in these areas, but others of you no doubt find it easier to avoid many of the &#8220;hands-on&#8221; things because they challenge you more than you are comfortable with. Be encouraged to tackle things with patience and endurance, looking to the Lord to supply your lack, and whether you are a bookworm who has never had a clue nor an interest in practical skills, or whether you have mastered many but avoided others, the Lord can help you be a greater blessing in your present and future families. The present pain is worth the future blessings.</p>

<p>The second is more important yet. In our spiritual lives, we face many giants and mountains. There are things that seem too big, too difficult, too something or other to make it through. I continue to face these things in my life. The key to victory is
<span class="scripture">&#8220;With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+19%3A26" title="Matthew 19:26"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 19:26)</span></a></span> God has a way. He will sometimes level the mountain in a moment, and sometimes will lead you by unknown paths through hidden places until you suddenly find that you have won through to the goal. But you must commit to trusting and following Him. In the midst of my wiring problems, I felt despair and perplexity, but I was committed to getting the job accomplished by the grace of God, and one day it was. The very things that caused me the greatest perplexity and despair were the things God used to equip me, so that I could face the later challenges with confidence. The very things that try you greatly and seem the hardest to bear, and perhaps seem only useless or damaging&#8212;if you will commit them to God and humble yourself to go through them with God&#8217;s help&#8212;God will cause them to yield great benefits to you.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re going to try to make this column interesting to you (that is, the people who this is addressed to), so we will welcome any suggestions you might have. In fact, we&#8217;re hoping you will answer some questions that we&#8217;ve written below.</p>

<ol>
<li>What shall our motto be? Part of our purpose is to be like the Good Samaritan (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+10%3A33">Luke 10:33</a>). This includes learning to sacrifice ourselves to help others in need&#8230;. Look in the Bible for good mottos.</li>

<li>We need a title. Should this be called an association? A squad? A club?</li>

<li>Do you have any particular topics that you want to discuss? Anything else?</li>

</ol>
<p>We would like to hear from more of you, but so far these replies have been given for questions 1 and 2:</p>

<ol>
<li>My suggestion is: <span class="scripture">&#8220;I will say of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+91%3A2" title="Psalm 91:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 91:2)</span></a></span></li>

<h2>The Pilot&#8217;s Voice: Part 1</h2>
<p>Isabel C. Byrum</p>

<p>Down the dusty road in the gathering shadows, a lad of sixteen summers hurried along. His brow was drawn in deep thought, and a close observer could have detected a look of unrest and guilt. At the crossroads he paused, then, to save time, he turned to cross the fields and, at length, came to a stream.</p>

<p>When he stepped upon the foot-log that crossed it, a strange feeling of fear and dread swept over him. The voice of his conscience was speaking and warning him of danger if he continued on the path he had taken. He remembered his good mother&#8217;s teaching that he should let Jesus pilot him in this voyage of life. She had urged him this very night not to go meet his friend, but he had not listened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Byron!&#8221; she had said sorrowfully, &#8220;I am afraid that if you continue in your plans tonight you will fall into com­pany that will do you harm!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to be a sissy any longer,&#8221; he had said scornfully, and walked resolutely out the gate. But he could not forget his mother&#8217;s parting words:</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember, I shall pray for you tonight.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>A week before, Byron had arranged this meeting with James, a boy a year older than he, with whom he had been associating for the past few months. From the first meeting Byron&#8217;s mother had not liked the shiftlessness and worldly-wisdom that she saw in James. She had warned him against it:</p>

<p>&#8220;The world, Byron, is as an ocean that we must spend our mortal life upon. God has given us the choosing of our course, but we can only make it safely by following His guidebook, the Bible. His Holy Spirit would pilot us through our conscience and protect us from the dangers. My daily prayer is that you may become a good Christian man, but a friendship with evil-doers will influence you in the wrong direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>Byron really wanted to be a noble and useful man in the world. He tried to make himself be­lieve that James was not so bad, and that his mother was just too careful. He soon pushed aside her warning and began to plan how he could have secret meetings with James.</p>

<p>It so worked out that Byron often visited his cousin Sunday afternoons, so James began meeting the two boys down by the river. Here they could talk, fish, or swim unnoticed. James often told daring and exciting stories and encouraged them to disregard their godly upbringing. &#8220;How can you ever become brave and strong with such tame living?&#8221; he questioned. &#8220;Your mother is a good woman, Byron, but you need to be able to think for yourself.&#8221; Byron soon began to regard the worship-hour at home as dull and lifeless compared to the fun times he had with James.</p>

<p>Sometime later, when the three boys were together, James brought out a pack of cards. &#8220;Here is a good game that you boys will want to learn,&#8221; he said, as he began dealing the cards.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d better not play,&#8221; Byron said quickly, remembering his mother&#8217;s warning about card playing. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid my mother will find it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, grow up a little,&#8221; James chided. &#8220;It&#8217;s about time you were learning these things.&#8221; After a few more remarks about how Byron&#8217;s mother would never find out, the boys agreed to learn. The afternoon flew by as they played game after game, one or the other of the cousins being allowed to win each time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that fun?&#8221; James said as they parted. &#8220;We only live once, so we might as well get all the enjoyment out of it that we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next time the boys met near the river, an older boy named George was there also. This time, as they played the game, Byron began to learn many tricks to take advantage of the others, and, though his conscience spoke to him about what he was getting into, he ignored it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, let&#8217;s put more life in it,&#8221; James said, after a time. &#8220;We can each put up some money for stakes.&#8221; Byron recoiled at the thought of gambling, but his objections were roughly made fun of. Finally, to avoid the shame and ridicule, Byron added the few coins he had, and the game began.</p>

<p>Each boy tried his best to win, but it was George that took the coin pile. James suggested that more money should be used, to which George readily agreed. &#8220;Yes, the more money the better. I&#8217;ve often found some lying around, and, if I&#8217;m careful, I can get some now and then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Byron, here, could easily lay aside a few of their farm eggs,&#8221; James said. &#8220;They could be secretly sold and his mother would never miss them.&#8221; Shocked to find himself a companion of thieves, Byron shrank from the deceitful plan. He remembered how, as a little boy, he had tried to deceive his mother and get out of work.</p>

<p>He and his sister had been sent out to plant beans. Soon growing weary of the job, Byron had suggested putting a couple seeds in each hole. This they did, and the number soon grew to four or five. However, when they heard the dinner bell ring, there were still quite a few left, so they found a stump, and buried the rest there, thinking it would never be found. It was only a week later when the seeds began to sprout. His older brother noticed where two or more seeds were coming up together, and, going over the field, found the stump, where a whole thicket of little bean sprouts were. He asked Byron what had happened, and Byron confessed what they had done. After their mother had been told, and they had been disciplined, she had said, &#8220;Evil deeds will sooner or later bear a harvest of bad things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; said Byron, with feeling, &#8220;if that wouldn&#8217;t be stealing, I don&#8217;t know what would, and I never want to be a thief.&#8221; Again Byron&#8217;s words were met with jeering. The eggs were just pay for all the work he did, James reasoned, but Byron&#8217;s thoughts were still troubled as he headed for home.</p>

<p>While working in the field the next morning, Byron thought over what James had said. He felt that he was old enough to judge and reason for himself, but the warnings of his mother stood before him. He knew that he would be doing the exact same sins she had taught him against.</p>

<p>As he passed through the barn at noon, a white hen scurried out from beneath a manger. Seeing the three eggs that lay there, Byron hesitated. Looking around, he reached out to take the eggs, but they seemed to burn him. But the thought of being ridiculed and termed a coward made him quickly grasp them. He climbed up in the loft and soon had them hidden beneath some hay.</p>

<p>Byron attempted to continue on as if nothing had happened, but his conscience pricked hard. Continually the voice urged him to turn from wrong and return the stolen eggs. But the thought of the boy&#8217;s ridicule won out, and the eggs were left in the loft and more added to them.</p>

<p>It was not long until Byron had a basketful of eggs, and when going to grind grain for his mother, he stopped by the store to sell them. As he passed by the gambling table at the door, a scene seemed to arise in Byron&#8217;s mind. The four hard-faced men on boxes, intent on winning the pile of money, became the four young men playing for nickels on the river bank. In both he saw the same lines of sin, and shuddered. In all his dreams of the future he had pictured himself either behind a counter or in an office chair. He wanted to do right, to be a respectable citizen and an honorable man. &#8220;But I can&#8217;t stop now,&#8221; he reasoned, and sold the eggs.</p>

<p>While waiting to have his wheat ground, Byron found the miller to be a kind, cheerful man. &#8220;It&#8217;s good to see you,&#8221; said he. &#8220;We have had much trouble lately, but I&#8217;m glad things are not worse.&#8221; He went on to tell a story about a young miller who had slipped into deceitfulness with his customers, but found that the burden of guilt far outweighed the gain he had thought to get. &#8220;Principle is that quality that makes a man do right because it is right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather do right and listen to the warnings of my conscience, than have all the wealth that comes through dishonesty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Byron&#8217;s heart beat wildly in shame as he considered the miller&#8217;s words. Would it yet be possible to undo the wrong of the past few weeks? A picture of the two great courses in life arose before him. Byron knew he had chosen the wrong one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go, tell your mother at once,&#8221; whispered that faithful voice in his ear. &#8220;She will be glad to help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but what about the boys?&#8221; thought Byron, as he headed down the road towards home.</p>

<h1>Making Sense of Things</h1>

<p>When I was young and just starting to work with carpentry tools and building materials, I used to fret at the sizes and dimensions of lumber. Why was a 2 x 4 actually three and one-half inches by one and one-half inches? Or a 2 x 6 actually five and one-half inches by one and one-half inches? Why, for that matter, was a sheet of plywood sold at four feet by eight feet? Why not ten by five, instead? The &#8220;strange&#8221; sizes did not evenly divide into a decimal system (as American money, for example), and I could not understand why things were the way that they were. After a great deal of time with a large dose of experience, things began to make more sense. The principles behind the long-accepted specifications began to reveal themselves. Human capacity was involved (a five by ten sheet of plywood weighs considerably more, therefore is harder to handle. The average height of a ceiling is seven and one-half feet to eight feet, which is better accommodated by a four by eight sheet.) It was interesting, instructive, and humbling to discover the inherent wisdom in the system.</p>

<p>As I began to understand, I could apply my new comprehension to the projects I had to do. Now, I could see that it was better to design a building around, say, a eight foot width and a sixteen foot length, than a nine or ten foot width and a fourteen or fifteen foot length. I could utilize my understanding of the building material specifications to advantage.</p>

<p>The same reasoning applies to the &#8220;specifications,&#8221; or principles of spiritual things. It has taken mankind a long time to realize that it is better for a human leader in government to occupy that office for only a relatively short period of time, such as four years or eight, etc., because the pressures and temptations that come with position are not good for the governor or the governed most of the time. The Lord governed the children of Israel through judges according to this principle, raising up leaders as needed, and establishing no human line of succession. He did not even establish a maximum period of time for them to govern, utilizing some of them for the rest of their lives from the point where He established them. When human reasoning and expectation promoted the sons of the judges to the same authority, the system began to fail. When the people rejected God in that capacity and asked for a king, it left them at disadvantage.</p>

<p>Men prosper according to the amount of divine wisdom that they build in their lives. All of the fundamental laws of morality that are adopted by unsaved people benefit them, inasmuch as they are able to observe and do them. The more you build your life on right things, the better off you will be; although this will not save you, nor will you be able to really get a hold of these things and keep them as you could if you were in touch with God and empowered, protected, and inspired by Him. But they will do you much good and keep you from many things that would make your life lower and degenerate. The more that people live to what light and understanding that they have, the better off they are, and the better the possibility that they will follow on to know the Lord, be born again, and then <span class="scripture">&#8220;walk in the light, as he is in the light.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1%3A7" title="I&nbsp;John 1:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 1:7)</span></a></span> For <span class="scripture">&#8220;the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+4%3A18-19" title="Proverbs 4:18-19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 4:18-19)</span></a></span></p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_3/The_Busy_Tool/index.html">The Busy Tool</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>The Busy Tool</h1>

<p>Once again we feel our dependency upon God to send the thoughts your way that will encourage and strengthen you. A few of you we know personally, many of you we do not know, but we are praying for each one of you. We do not know your need, but God does, and we look to Him to lead and guide each one into all truth.</p>

<p>I am sure many, if not all of you lead very busy lives. Seems like in this age of many conveniences to make our work go faster and easier we would have much more time. But it just doesn&#8217;t seem to work that way! Like a little verse that my mother, as a girl, received from her aunt, after she had walked to her house for an item and returned home without it. Aunt Lydia only had one child, but was busy at the moment and couldn&#8217;t stop just then and get the object needed. My mother grew tired of waiting and returned home. In a day or so mother received a card in the mail with a verse something like this:</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Every blessed day is busy,
<br />And I&#8217;ve more than I can do,
<br />Yet my heart finds time for prayer,
<br />And pleasant thoughts of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>You may have asked yourself why is it that life is always so busy? No matter how many time-saving things have been invented, we still have too much to do. Some people are even trying to go back to the old way of no electricity, using the old-fashioned methods again. Do you think they will have more time? I don&#8217;t think so. Busyness is just part of this life. The enemy of our soul will use the busyness of life to take our minds off God if we don&#8217;t fight against it. This is one of our battles in this world. A minister was once preaching a message on being too busy. He saw a little boy playing and riding his tricycle. He had been watching this child and observed that even children could be so busy that God would have a hard time talking to them.</p>

<p>Oh, may we not be too busy for God to talk to us! What an awful mistake that would be! This is the devil&#8217;s business, and we must make up our minds to fight it, if we are to succeed in the Christian life. For the unsaved we find them busy with entertainment in their non-working hours. This keeps their minds occupied so that they have no time to think about their souls and where they are going to spend eternity. The following song comes to mind:</p>

<p class="verse">Have you any time for Jesus,<br />While the fleeting moments roll?<br />Is this mortal life so busy<br />That you cannot save you soul?</p>

<p class="verse">Have you any time for Jesus?<br />Can it be, life&#8217;s journey through,<br />That you have no time to serve Him<br />Who has spent His life for you?</p>

<p class="verse">Time for business, time for pleasure,<br />Time to revel on in sin&#8212;<br />Will you not take time for Jesus?<br />Oh, invite Him to come in.</p>

<p class="verse">If you have no time for Jesus<br />Ere you pass beyond the blue,<br />In the resurrection morning<br />He will have no time for you.</p>

<p class="verse refrain_line">Refrain:</p><p class="verse refrain">Soon the summons from the portals<br />Of the mansions in the sky,<br />May be sounding your departure;<br />You must then take time to die.<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Have_You_Any_Time_for_Jesus/index.html" title="Have You Any Time for Jesus?">*</a></p>

<p>We have heard it said that discouragement is one of the most used tools in the devil&#8217;s workshop. I believe the busy tool is a very well-used one also; as we can plainly see, he uses it on the saint and the sinner alike. Now, let&#8217;s take a look at the life of Jesus. The scripture says He was <span class="scripture">&#8220;in all points tempted like as we are.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A15" title="Hebrews 4:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 4:15)</span></a></span> Did Jesus feel pressed and busy? I am sure He did. Let&#8217;s see what He did about it.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat. And they departed into a desert place by ship privately. And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+6%3A31-33" title="Mark 6:31-33"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 6:31-33)</span></a></span>
John the Baptist had just been beheaded and the disciples had come to Jesus to tell Him &#8220;all things.&#8221; What a privilege to tell Jesus &#8220;all things.&#8221; Jesus felt they needed a rest from the stress and pressures, but now it must be postponed! The people were following them again! Oh, how small our problems look when we see the problems Jesus had! What did Jesus do? Did He tell them to go away? Oh, Lord help us to be more like our Lord and Master. Let&#8217;s behold His love: &#8220;And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.&#8221; Mothers, we may get weary in teaching and training our children, but if we don&#8217;t do it, our children will bear the neglect, and shame will be ours to shoulder. Pray for more of Jesus&#8217; compassion. As Jesus taught the people the day wore on and it grew late. The disciples suggested to send the people away to buy food for they had nothing to eat. Jesus told them, &#8220;Give ye them to eat.&#8221; I can just imagine them thinking, &#8220;What! Jesus, we are in a desert place; how can we feed them?&#8221; It surely looked impossible! Does Jesus seemingly ask the impossible of you? Look to God to perform the needed miracle just as He increased the small lunch of five loaves and two small fishes to feed five thousand. Be encouraged, the Lord can take the little that we give Him and make a lot out of it.</p>

<p>Now Jesus hadn&#8217;t forgotten the need to get away and rest. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people. And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+6%3A45-46" title="Mark 6:45-46"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 6:45-46)</span></a></span></p>

<p>What a privilege to go in prayer to our heavenly Father. If Jesus, our example prayed, how much more we need to escape from the busy cares of life and find heavenly strength. He is just longing and waiting for our communion with Him. Remember in the beginning of time, God came down in the cool of the evening to commune with Adam and Eve. He wants to commune with us too. Take time, take time, take time to pray. Pray until your burden is lifted, your heart is light and free and you have a song. Mothers, it is so important to get up early before the children, if possible, for meditation and prayer. With a tiny baby, this may be impossible. You can read and pray while you nurse that little one. One young mother kept a Testament in the bathroom. An older sister told me she prayed while she did dishes. She said folks will leave you alone there! She also prayed for folks in the congregation in the night when she would awaken and couldn&#8217;t sleep. Have you heard about &#8220;Praying Mary&#8221;? She was a busy servant girl, but one who loved the Lord and found time for prayer.</p>

<p>May the Lord strengthen and encourage you is our prayer.</p>

<p>&#8212;E.S.</p>

<p>A number of ministers were assembled for the discussion of difficult questions. Among others it was asked how the command to &#8220;pray without ceasing&#8221; could be complied with. Various suppositions were started and at length one of the number was appointed to write an essay upon it, to be read at the next monthly meeting; which, being overheard by a plain, sensible, servant girl, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;What! A whole month wanted to explain the meaning of that text! It is one of the easiest and best in the Bible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; said an old minister, &#8220;Mary, what can you say about it? Let us know how you understand it; can you pray all the time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, when you have so many things to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, sir, the more I have to do the more I can pray.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed! Well, Mary, do let us know how it is, for most people think otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; said the girl (familiar with the Scriptures), &#8220;when I first open my eyes in the morning, I pray: Lord, keep the eyes of my understanding open; and while I am dressing, I pray that I may be kept clothed with the robe of righteousness; and when I wash myself, I ask that I may be kept clean from the stain of sin; and as I begin to work, I pray that I may have strength equal to my day; when I begin to kindle up the fire, I pray that God&#8217;s work may revive in my soul. And as I sweep the house, I pray that my heart may be kept free from all impurities; and while preparing and partaking of breakfast, I desire to be fed from the hidden manna and the sincere milk of the Word; and as I am busy with the little children, I look up to God as my Father, and thank Him for the spirit of adoption, that I am His child; and so on all day, everything I do furnishes me with the thought for prayer and praise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough, enough,&#8221; cried the minister, &#8220;these things are revealed to babes, and often hidden from the wise and prudent; go on, Mary,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and pray without ceasing, and as for us, my brethren, let us bless the Lord for this exposition, and remember that <span class="scripture">&#8216;the meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+25%3A9" title="Psalm 25:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 25:9)</span></a></span>&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<h1>The Purity of Little Girls</h1>

<p class="author">Mrs. J. T. Benson</p>

<p>Annie Miller was helping Mrs. Burnett with the children&#8217;s spring and summer clothes. She had sewn with her two weeks in the fall and had been so industrious and clever with her needle that Mrs. Burnett had engaged her long ahead of time for the spring sewing.</p>

<p>A friend had told her of the young seamstress, and something of her life. Annie was an inmate of the Crittenton home, and though her baby was three years old now, she still stayed on, being a great help to the matron in the sewing room of the institution. And because she was a quiet, well behaved girl, she was allowed to work out for a week or two now and then to make a little extra money for herself and child.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnett had grown very fond of Annie, and Annie appreciated Mrs. Burnett&#8217;s kind friendly attitude and did the very best work she could for her.</p>

<p>One day as they sat in the sewing room, Mrs. Burnett glanced out of the window at a car which had stopped at her next-door-neighbor&#8217;s gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, Annie, there is Nina Wilson,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t she the loveliest thing? She is an only child, and her parents value her as if she were made of gold,&#8221; said Mrs. Burnett with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;A pure and lovely girl is worth more than her weight in any earthly treasure,&#8221; said Annie quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what Mrs. Wilson thinks, and she is the loveliest mother, my ideal of what the mother of a sweet young girl ought to be. She is interested in every thing which touches Nina&#8217;s life. She doesn&#8217;t forget that the girl is young and sees to it that she has the proper amount of pleasure with those of her own age. But not one bit of loose or careless behavior is allowed. There are no auto rides at night, and no gatherings of any kind without the presence of some grown person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How old is she?&#8221; asked Annie.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is sixteen, a girl&#8217;s loveliest age, when she is unfolding so beautifully into womanhood. And yet, it is perhaps the most critical period of her life too, when, more than any other time, she needs the tender, watchful care of a wise mother. Oh, Mrs. Wilson has been such a lesson to me in this respect. When my own little daughters have reached Nina&#8217;s age, I intend they shall be guarded in just the same way,&#8221; said Mrs. Burnett.</p>

<p>There was a little pause, then Annie looked at Mrs. Burnett and said, &#8220;Why wait until they are budding into lovely young girlhood to bestow all that watchful care upon them, Mrs. Burnett? Why not give it to them now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, they are only children,&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Burnett in surprise. &#8220;They do not need it now; that is, not in just the same way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that is how most mothers look at it, but I also know that it is a very grave mistake,&#8221; said Annie.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have a habit of looking at childhood as a time of carefree, happy innocence and forget that the devil is just as busy putting temptations into the paths of children as of grown people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know children are tempted to tell stories and deceive their parents, and even to take things which do not belong to them, but surely, Annie, you can&#8217;t think that the question of her virtue touches a little girl&#8217;s life as it does an older one,&#8221; said Mrs. Burnett.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not, yet, I do mean that the question of a little girl&#8217;s purity is often at stake,&#8221; said Annie. &#8220;I believe that many a girl who falls when she is sixteen or eighteen or twenty in spite of the tender, watchful care of her mother, would have been saved that terrible step if her mother had given her the same protecting care when she was six or eight, or ten years of age.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnett looked at the young woman in silence, too much surprised to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, Mrs. Burnett,&#8221; said Annie, &#8220;you know that I have a little fatherless child at the Home. But you don&#8217;t know any of the particulars of my story. Painful as it is, I am going to tell you that story, hoping that it will put you on your guard about your own little girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother was a good woman, but she did not see that from the time a girl begins to play with other children, every year of her life is a critical one. No, like you, she thought that the very innocence of childhood would see me safely through those early years, and then, with the dawning of young womanhood she became tenderly solicitous and on her guard. But it was too late. I had started wrong when I was eight years old.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How terrible!&#8221; cried Mrs. Burnett.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not necessary to conclude that I was an unusually depraved child. I wasn&#8217;t, but I did have the intense curiosity about life&#8217;s mysteries that other children have, and since I was allowed to play freely and for long hours at a time with little neighbor boys and girls in the orchard, the wood lot and the large barn on my father&#8217;s place, we children had ample opportunity to say and do a great many things our parents never dreamed of. And yet I have heard the mothers in our neighborhood congratulate themselves that we children had such a safe place to play as father&#8217;s big old barn, with its many stalls and loft full of sweet clean hay.</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Burnett made a sudden motion as to rise from her chair, and her eyes glanced uneasily out the back window toward the garage, a favorite play place for the children and their friends. But she sank back again as Annie continued her story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, we knew we were being very bad children, but the devil whispered that it didn&#8217;t make much difference what children did when they were so young; that we would not even think of such naughty things when we were older, but would be sweet and pretty and good like the grown young ladies we knew. This went on, now and then, for several years. By the time I was twelve years old, I began to realize it wasn&#8217;t so easy to be a sweet, pure, young girl as I had thought. I truly wanted to be, but the memory of those ugly things back there beat me down. I felt that I could never be like girls whose childhood had no black spots, because they had been better cared for.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of trying to be sweet and pure now?&#8221; I asked myself. &#8220;I am different and nothing can alter the fact.&#8221; I grew reckless, and you know the rest of the story.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl was weeping by this time, and as she wiped the tears from her eyes, she cried out, &#8220;Oh, that mothers would realize how priceless is the modesty and purity of little girlhood! If they did, they wouldn&#8217;t be so careless of it, or take so much for granted. They seem to think that the child&#8217;s chastity is a question of the future. But it isn&#8217;t true: it is a question of now. And because parents do not see this, children are left together in the most unguarded way, and sin is much more common among them than you have any idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to make another statement, Mrs. Burnett, which may cost me your friendship, but the fact is that the dresses you have made for Dorothy and May are not modest. I am not so surprised that worldly people should be governed by such fashions, but the thing I can&#8217;t understand is that Christian mothers will fall right into line, and send their little daughters out half-naked because it is the style.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is May, twelve years old and large for her age. It is very natural that she should still be just a child in your eyes, but she doesn&#8217;t look that way to other people. She is developing rapidly and may at any time pass from childhood into young womanhood. Yet between her socks and the short dresses we have just finished for her there is a stretch of big bare legs, reaching halfway to her waist! Dorothy&#8217;s are even worse. Neither of them have sleeves in their little frocks and the necks are cut very low. Of course, Dorothy is only six years old, but Mrs. Burnett, how can you expect her to grow into a modest young girl when all her life she has been used to exposing the larger part of her body to the gaze of the public? People have lots to say these days about the immodest dress of women and young girls, but I think the most indecently clad creature among us is the average little American girl whether she is six or twelve. I have heard but one minister speak on this subject. The others are busy crying out against the insufficient dress of older girls and women. But this man said the trouble with the grown ones began back in childhood, that he didn&#8217;t see how it was possible to produce a generation of modest young women from a crowd of half-clad little girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>As silence fell between the two women, Mrs. Burnett was grave and thoughtful, and the excitement had died out of Annie&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>At last Annie said, &#8220;The time will come, I suppose, when my little girl will learn from someone that her mother hasn&#8217;t always been a good woman. But by the grace of God, she shall never be able to say that I was a careless mother, for I shall guard her purity as the most priceless thing on earth; not only the purity of her young womanhood, but of her childhood, as well. And because I want her to be a modest, as well as virtuous child, I shall not put dresses on her which only half cover her little body.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe that you are going to be a wise and good mother, Annie,&#8221; said Mrs. Burnett, &#8220;and there is no reason why I shouldn&#8217;t be also. I am going out for a few minutes to see what the children are doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused at the door and looked back. &#8220;And while I am gone, you may begin to rip the hems out of those dresses; we will let them down so that they will cover the little girls knees,&#8221; she said.</p>

<h1>The Children&#8217;s Hour: &#8220;This Little Light of Mine&#8221;</h1>

<h2>A lesson to share with your children</h2>
<p class="verse">This little light of mine
<br />I&#8217;m going to let it shine,
<br />This little light of mine,
<br />I&#8217;m going to let it shine,
<br />Let it shine,
<br />Let it shine,
<br />All the time!</p>

<p class="verse">Don&#8217;t put it under a bushel, No!
<br />I&#8217;m going to let it shine,
<br />Don&#8217;t put it under a bushel, No!
<br />I&#8217;m going to let it shine,
<br />Let it shine,
<br />Let it shine,
<br />All the time!</p>

<p class="verse">Don&#8217;t let Satan blow it out!
<br />I&#8217;m going to let it shine,
<br />Don&#8217;t let Satan blow it out!
<br />I&#8217;m going to let it shine,
<br />Let it shine,
<br />Let it shine,
<br />All the time!</p>

<p class="verse">Let it shine till Jesus comes,
<br />I&#8217;m going to let it shine,
<br />Let it shine till Jesus comes,
<br />I&#8217;m going to let it shine,
<br />Let it shine,
<br />Let it shine,
<br />All the time!</p>

<p>Jesus is the light that shines within us and gives us grace to shine even when trials come. Encourage your children to gather from this source of Light when things don&#8217;t go their way, by using a simple project to illustrate it. When I did this, we first read a story of someone in the Bible whose life shone with Christ (Dorcas, Peter, Paul, etc.) Afterwards, give each child a standard flat canning jar lid (not the ring), a small lump of clay, and a regular white birthday candle. Press the clay in the middle of the lid, coming up in a &#8220;blob&#8221; in the center. In this, stick the candle. If you wish to do so, you could cut a hole in the lid and put a wire through making a &#8220;finger loop&#8221; to hold the lamp. This can be dangerous if the wire is not secure, and with several children, it is not advisable. Your candle is now ready to light! Sing the first verse of the song and watch the children&#8217;s faces glow! When it comes to the second verse, hand each child a jar that fits completely over their lamp&#8212;a bushel. Place over the candle and watch what happens&#8212;the light will go out from lack of air. (If you don&#8217;t leave the bushel on too long the candle will revive, or relight.) Third verse: have the children try to blow out their lamps as Satan tries to do in our hearts. Remind them that when we are feeling grumpy and being naughty it is like we are putting a bushel over our light and Jesus can&#8217;t be seen. Or if we want to take something that doesn&#8217;t belong to us, Satan is trying to blow out our light. I&#8217;m sure the Lord can give you many more applications to make!</p>

<p>God bless you as you seek to get across God&#8217;s wonderful lessons to your little ones!</p>

<h1>How Do I Mend This?</h1>

<p>The telephone rang&#8212;it was my neighbor. She had washed a pillow and the zipper on the cover had broken. She needed to return the borrowed pillow in 30 minutes! Could I fix it for her? I wasn&#8217;t too optimistic&#8212;broken zippers have not been a success story with me. But I told her to bring it over and we&#8217;d see what could be done.</p>

<p>I thought, &#8220;Lord, I didn&#8217;t need another task this morning.&#8221; I was already on a schedule crunch! But the Lord just whispered to my heart that He was giving me another mending article, and in my heart arose a &#8220;yes, Lord&#8221; and &#8220;please help me know how to repair this zipper.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Foundation_Truth_3/mend_pliars.jpg" alt="" width="66" height="79" /></div>
<p>As pictured, the teeth were out of the groove at the base. An ice pick was used to open the groove a little wider (A). The teeth were then inserted in and held in place while a pair of pliers were used to squeeze the groove together again (B). It was fixed and returned in the time required! Thank the Lord for making it so simple! My heart resounds with a verse of song:</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer!&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/What_a_Friend_We_Have_in_Jesus/index.html" title="What a Friend We Have in Jesus">*</a></p>

<p>Even our mending!</p>

<h2>Dressmaking Hints</h2>
<p>There is something that I was extremely blessed by just recently that I wanted to extend the blessing to any that would benefit by it. Increasingly over the years I have noticed that it has become more and more difficult for me to take off my garments over my head. Recently I started putting in zippers on the side of my dresses. It has helped out a great deal, but if you are trying to keep the cost down, a zipper is just another expense and also extra work to put in nicely. I know that I must be willing to go the extra mile if it is necessary, but just recently my eldest daughter surprised me for my birthday by finishing up a dress that I had just started, which included a simpler side opening.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Foundation_Truth_3/mend_dress.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="329" /></div>
<p>To my delight I found two snaps on the side above the waist line (A). The opening was put in just above the right side pocket (B), which allows more room for getting in and out. The top of the pocket was not attached to the waist seam as usual, but serged to keep it from unraveling (C). We have found that snaps are not sufficient, as they easily pop open, but a hook at the waistline, with a narrow strip of velcro or a snap above (as pictured) should work well. Plaques made from the dress fabric are sewn over the side seam allowance in this area to strengthen it (D). If the seam allowance is wide enough, it can be folded for strength instead. It may be easier to have the opening on the left side if you are right-handed, and on the right side if you are left-handed.</p>

<p>I am always keeping my ears and eyes open to learning how to simplify the areas of life that are required of a Godly homemaker. I want to focus my time on doing the things that God requires of me, but not take more time than necessary in areas of cooking or sewing which are always beckoning on us, as we all need to eat and be clothed appropriately. Pray for me as often these can be a great gobbler of time.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A15-16" title="Ephesians 5:15-16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 5:15-16)</span></a></span></p>

<h1>Washing Windows with My Husband</h1>

<p class="author">Alice Mae Heslin</p>

<p class="verse">You on the outside, the hard side,
<br />Your ladder against the house leaning,
<br />And I on the inside, the safe side,
<br />Together the same window are cleaning.</p>

<p class="verse">The dirty film that you spray and wipe
<br />Is not the same as mine,
<br />For each window in this small still house
<br />Bears two kinds of grime.</p>

<p class="verse">Yours on the outside comes from the yard,
<br />And the trees, and the windswept street,
<br />While mine results from meals prepared,
<br />And the warmth of our central heat.</p>

<p class="verse">So we spray and wipe, each on a side
<br />Till rag and window squeak,
<br />Then standing back to survey our work,
<br />Are dismayed by an overlooked streak.</p>

<p class="verse">This flaw which mars the now clean glass
<br />Is it on your side or mine?
<br />It really doesn&#8217;t matter, Love, we
<br />Will both spray again and shine.</p>

<p class="verse">And now it gleams pristinely bright,
<br />As though no glass were there.
<br />And every window, inside and out,
<br />Receives the selfsame care.</p>

<p class="verse">While working on this irksome task,
<br />A thought occurs to me.
<br />That in a way, this job portrays
<br />Our life as it should be.</p>

<p class="verse">You on the outside, the hard side;
<br />Up against the world and its grime.
<br />Working and struggling and striving,
<br />So that our bright windows may shine.</p>

<p class="verse">And I on the inside, the safe side,
<br />Keeping warmth and comfort there.
<br />Yet sometimes when trying our hardest,
<br />That flaw appears somewhere.</p>

<p class="verse">Is it on your side or my side, my Darling?
<br />Does it matter who&#8217;s wrong or who&#8217;s right?
<br />We&#8217;ll rub and we&#8217;ll scrub and we&#8217;ll polish,
<br />And together we&#8217;ll let in God&#8217;s light.</p>

<h1>His Jewels</h1>

<p class="author">Charles E. Orr</p>

<p>To adorn is to make attractive, to beautify. We are exhorted by the apostle Paul to adorn the doctrine of the New Testament by our everyday life. This thought should be a powerful incentive to close living with God and assiduously keeping all His commandments. Who would not take pleasure in adorning the teachings of Jesus by a pure life? This is the joy of the Christian&#8217;s heart. He cares nothing for the adornings of the world, but oh, that he may so live as to make beautiful the blessed Bible!&#8212;this is happiness enough for him.</p>

<p>In another of the Pauline Epistles we are commanded to let our manner of life be <span class="scripture">&#8220;as becometh the gospel of Christ.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+1%3A27" title="Philippians 1:27"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 1:27)</span></a></span> To become is also to make attractive or to give a better appearance to. An article of dress is becoming to us when it gives us a better appearance. We speak of anyone&#8217;s bad conduct as not becoming to him. We are to become the gospel of Christ by holy living. When a life is lived as God designed that life should be, that life will be an adornment to the Scriptures.</p>

<p>God will beautify His children with the glories of His redeeming grace; He will adorn them with a meek and quiet spirit, which in His sight is very precious, that, they, in turn, may adorn His commandments. As a bride decketh herself with jewels, so the heavenly Father beautifies His children with the robe of righteousness.</p>

<p>The life of a Christian is God&#8217;s special treasure. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And they shall be mine, saith the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Malachi+3%3A17" title="Malachi 3:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Malachi 3:17)</span></a></span>&#8212;or &#8220;special treasure&#8221; as rendered by the margin. By reading the context we learn that it is those who fear the Lord that are His jewels. To fear God and keep His commandments is man&#8217;s whole duty. It is a perfect life. Such a life is the Lord&#8217;s jewel. Such a life is recorded in heaven. Oh, how animating is such knowledge! How it strengthens our hearts to live a righteous life. To live a life that is worthy to be recorded in heaven and is a special treasure to God is truly wonderful. Our souls are awed by such a thought. Oh, how it ought to move our hearts to carefulness in life! How diligent we should be to walk as worthy citizens of our heavenly state! Someday the Lord will come and gather up these holy lives and place them in His heavenly courts above, where they shall shine as stars forever.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>About jewelry and make-up&#8230;&#8203;my feeling is that the key is not to overdo it. I don&#8217;t think that it is wrong to spend maybe 10 minutes or so braiding your hair or applying tasteful make-up in the morning. Last summer, I was really wondering about this, and I found the place in the Bible where Job names one of his daughters &#8220;Kerenhappuch&#8221; (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Job+42%3A14">Job 42:14</a>) quite interesting. The notes in my Bible say this means &#8220;container of antimony,&#8221; which was a highly prized black eye shadow. The verses go on to say that Job&#8217;s daughters were the most beautiful in all the land, and that his entire family prospered. This seems to indicate that the wearing of such make-up is okay. I would say that the problem comes when you are either doing such things for the wrong reasons, or else are letting them get in the way of more important things. This can also be reflected in how much money you invest into such habits. Recently I came across some of my old records, and was surprised at how much I spent on clothes and accessories. This was despite the fact that I only bought an item if it was a good value and &#8220;inexpensive.&#8221; Again, this comes back to the theme of being refined in holiness. In particular, I find it unfortunate that so many people think their rings, etc., need to be of high quality gold and expensive jewels. I mean, if I am engaged, I would like an engagement ring (my &#8220;ideal&#8221; would be a smooth gold thread with a ripple at the crest, adorned with a single speck of diamond, if finances permitted at the time, and I certainly would like a &#8220;real&#8221; wedding ring. Even now I have three rings I wear on a daily basis. I bought two of them (for about $15), and one is a ring my mom got for the Christmas she was fifteen, and although I really don&#8217;t know how much it&#8217;s worth, I&#8217;d say about $30-60. Sometimes I also wear earrings or a necklace. I used to wear a dusting of powder, brown eye shadow, and a touch of lipgloss. I had to switch over to homemade lipgloss, which of course is totally clear, due to a sensitivity I developed to the artificial flavorings and additives in the store-bought brands. Then even though my eye doctor said I should be okay sticking with a hypoallergenic brand, (I have minor problems with my eyes and wear contacts besides) such eye shadow still bothered me on occasion and plus I got bored with the single color they offered that I liked. So basically, even though I could probably find some nice things to wear that would fit my needs, I don&#8217;t feel like investing the time or money because it&#8217;s just not that important, and the only thing I wear is my homemade clear lipgloss with a rare coat of nail polish.</p>

<p>I have gotten the impression from some conservatives that it is practically a mandatory responsibility of a lady to have rosy lips, a smooth complexion, and lightly accented eyes. Others seem to feel it is our duty to abstain from all such things. I just feel that God wants us to enjoy beauty. Although things like jewelry and make-up shouldn&#8217;t be the primary source, often times they can add a nice complement to our inherent beauty, God&#8217;s lovely world, and most importantly, our spiritual beauty. As far as contentment&#8217;s connection goes, I have never really pondered that&#8230;. Hopefully some of the rest of you can give us some aspects to consider! I always appreciate hearing more things and the reasons why people believe the way they do. I know some people who can&#8217;t stand to discuss such things, they say it&#8217;s pointless because everyone has their own opinion anyways. And certainly, it is important to stand up for your convictions. But the sharing of them can help you explore and strengthen your own as you realize new things you might not have even thought of before!</p>

<p>About the subject of jewelry: I wear bracelets, necklaces, and rings. I used to wear earrings, too, but I have struggled with deciding whether that is right. In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+35%3A4">Genesis 35:4</a>, Jacob&#8217;s family has to put away the pagan images and charms they had brought from Syria. These things had to be buried before they could meet God at Bethel. It mentions their earrings are buried. This seems to me that earrings are counted as a form of ungodliness. In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Judges+8%3A24">Judges 8:24</a>, it mentions that the Ishmaelites wore golden earrings. But then, there are other references to earrings which seem to condone the wearing of earrings, like in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+24%3A22">Genesis 24:22</a>. And the earring which the servant gave to Rebekah, according to notes in my study Bible, was probably very large. And it seems that is true if it weighed half a shekel. In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+16%3A12">Ezekiel 16:12</a>, God is reminding Jerusalem of what He did for them. And He says <span class="scripture">&#8220;And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine head.&#8221;</span> It sounds to me like earrings are a favorable ornament. However in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hosea+2%3A13">Hosea 2:13</a>, earrings seem to be associated with a harlot. And then, listen to this,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+25%3A12" title="Proverbs 25:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 25:12)</span></a></span>
As far as I can see, taking the New Testament into account as well, we have liberty to adorn ourselves with jewelry, but not in a way that draws attention to ourselves. In other words, have a pleasant appearance without overdoing it.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>I just thought I&#8217;d share my thoughts on adornment. Like those who have written already, I don&#8217;t think we ought to be too gaudy or drawing a lot of attention to ourselves. I don&#8217;t think that there is a problem with wearing jewelry or using make-up. I also think we should look reasonable. Keep in mind a couple of things&#8230;. First, we are the temple of the Holy Spirit (shouldn&#8217;t we look our best to honor Him?), and secondly, we are representatives and ambassadors of Christ. And again it comes back to honoring God. Now, I&#8217;m not into girls getting really wrapped up in making themselves beautiful. There has got to be a balance. I don&#8217;t think we need to go to either extreme of either trying to look just perfect and thinking all about being beautiful, or on the other hand paying no attention whatsoever to how we look. I personally don&#8217;t normally wear make-up, I&#8217;m not totally against it, but I don&#8217;t feel like for me it&#8217;s something I want to invest my money and time into. Occasionally I use concealer and maybe some blush and light lipstick, but even that is rare. Maybe someday when I have wrinkles I want to hide or something, or who knows, maybe I&#8217;ll decide I want to wear a little make-up regularly at some point, but for now I don&#8217;t. Earrings are the same way. I don&#8217;t have pierced ears and it&#8217;s not something I really care about and I feel like spending money on (and pain!). I do wear necklaces sometimes and occasionally a bracelet. I used to have a necklace that I wore daily with two things on it&#8230;&#8203;one was a gift from my parents when I got baptized and one was a key to symbolize my commitment to purity and courtship&#8230;&#8203;unfortunately I lost it one day when I was piling up branches to burn. A branch got hooked on it while I was throwing it into the pile and the chain broke and the two things went flying and I never was able to find them again. At least things aren&#8217;t what matter, and what the necklace symbolized is still there. The necklace was a symbol and only a symbol; I can do without it.</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear ladies,</p>

<p>I found a few verses that I thought might be of interest to you all.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;I will greatly rejoice in the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+61%3A10" title="Isaiah 61:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 61:10)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+21%3A2" title="Revelation 21:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 21:2)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Here in the New Testament, John is referring to the Jewish bride, which we know from Isaiah 61:10, would adorn herself with her jewels. If in the New Testament, the holy city is likened unto a bride adorned for her husband, I feel that the Bible is then condoning the wearing of jewelry even after we were set free from the from of the law. Please, all of you, share with me your thoughts on these verses as well. Maybe there is something I am not seeing that others will.</p>

<p>And this is just my opinion, but are not gold and precious stones part of the creation of God? Doesn&#8217;t He want us to appreciate what He has made and give the glory to Him?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When we think of these scriptures, we would like to suggest looking at them from a spiritual point of view rather than from an earthly one. Let&#8217;s take them in context rather than taking the ends of these verses in Isaiah and Revelation and say they would suggest the wearing of jewelry is alright. As Christians, by putting our faith in the atoning work of the cross we are clothed in the garments of salvation and are covered with the robe of righteousness. An earthly bride adorns herself with her jewels (earthly groom with ornaments). Just think of the average wedding today and we can get a good picture of this. But as a spiritual bride, the Bride of Jesus Christ Himself, we &#8220;adorn&#8221; ourselves with the garments of salvation and the robe of righteousness, which is from Him, not ourselves. This should be with the same delight, joy and anticipation that this earthly bride would have. This scripture is a simile, showing us the contrast of earthly vs. spiritual. The thought here being we, as believers, have a different emphasis. The earthly adornments are temporal and physically put on, for man, not God. The spiritual clothing here mentioned are eternal and God given. The scripture in Rev. is basically the same comparison. The new Jerusalem was built by God for His people. He did use many precious stones, gold etc&#8230;&#8203;to build it. A glorious thing to contemplate. Those written in the Lamb&#8217;s book of Life will dwell there (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+21%3A27">Revelation 21:27</a>). Scripture refers to the city as the Bride but obviously Jesus, the Lamb of God, isn&#8217;t marrying the city but the people in it. To us this does not have anything to do with whether we should wear jewelry or not. Rather we should be overjoyed at the grace and mercy of God toward us that as the Bride of Christ He provided salvation and the righteousness of Jesus for our clothing. In heaven we will be clothed in white raiment (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+3%3A5">Revelation 3:5</a>), and for those who overcome, the promise of a crown is given (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+1%3A12">James 1:12</a>). Even with that, may we have the vision the hymn writer did as he penned these verses:</p>

<p class="verse">Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty!
<br />Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;
<br />Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty,
<br />God in three persons, blessed Trinity!</p>

<p class="verse">Holy, holy, holy, all the Saints adore Thee,
<br />Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;
<br />Cherubim and Serephim, falling down before Thee,
<br />Which wert and art and evermore shall be.<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Holy_Holy_Holy/index.html" title="Holy, Holy, Holy">*</a></p>

<p>We pray that this will be a blessing in some way!</p>

<p>P.S. We happened to get a picture in the mail today of a Jewish wedding. This was a recent wedding. It was interesting to note that all of the men, groom included, wore plain dark suits with ties and black hats. There were no flowers on their lapels. The women were also in very plain dark dresses. Very modest&#8212;high necklines and long sleeves. The bride was in a plain white dress, also with a high neckline and long sleeves. There was no lace, beading, etc&#8230;. She had a very simple bouquet, no ribbons hanging down, etc&#8230;. There were no other flowers. The father of the bride was [a] Rabbi.</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>The topic of make-up and jewelry has been very interesting so far. I&#8217;m glad we can discuss topics like this without it turning into an argument. I find I <i>always</i> learn a <i>lot</i> from discussing beliefs with others.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my beliefs on the subjects&#8212;please don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m trying to condemn anyone or anything! This is just what the Lord has shown me is best for me to do at this time. I respect each of your beliefs, and I want to remain open and teachable!</p>

<p><b>Make-up:</b> I believe God created me exactly the way He wants me to look, and I need to be accepting and thankful for the way I am. One way of demonstrating that I believe God knows best in this area is to not try to change or &#8220;improve&#8221; the way I look. <i>Of course,</i> we need to take care of our bodies and look our best for His sake, but this can be accomplished without spending time trying to alter our physical characteristics. Instead, we need to focus on developing and improving our spiritual characteristics&#8212;that&#8217;s what really matters!</p>

<p>Obviously, we need to take care to dress neatly, and keep our hair combed, etc. But I feel that make-up is in a different category, since it&#8217;s more along the lines of trying to &#8220;improve&#8221; upon the way the Lord created us. Personally, I know that once I got started using make-up it&#8217;d be very easy to become more and more consumed with it, and end up spending a lot of time and money on it. That&#8217;s just one more reason why I&#8217;ve felt it best not to use any at all.</p>

<p>I do, however, believe there could possibly be occasion to use make-up&#8212;for instance, if someone had a large scar or burned area on their face, and everyone found it difficult to talk to that person because they felt like they couldn&#8217;t help staring, or something&#8230;. In that case, I would think the person would not be wrong in using some make-up, as long as their attitude was right. If they were thinking all along, &#8220;It&#8217;s terrible that God let me get this scar&#8212;I&#8217;ve got to try to fix myself up so people will think I&#8217;m pretty again,&#8221; then they wouldn&#8217;t be honoring God. But if they said, &#8220;Lord, I know you let this happen to me for a reason, and I want to learn all I can through it,&#8221; and then felt that the Lord&#8217;s will was for them to use some make-up so they&#8217;d be able to more effectively minister to others, they would be honoring God. This is the main instance I could think of where make-up could be used for a Godly purpose.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s some additional principles and verses on the subject that the Lord showed me:</p>

<ol>
<li>God has made each person <i>exactly</i> the way they are for a reason.
<br />We <span class="scripture">&#8220;are complete in him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+2%3A8-10" title="Colossians 2:8-10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 2:8-10)</span></a></span>
<br />We are <span class="scripture">&#8220;fearfully and wonderfully made.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+139%3A13-16" title="Psalm 139:13-16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 139:13-16)</span></a></span>
<br /><span class="scripture">&#8220;Shall the clay say to him that fashioned it, What makest thou?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+45%3A9" title="Isaiah 45:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 45:9)</span></a></span></li>

<li>Outward &#8220;beauty&#8221; is not necessary for happiness&#8212;but Godly inward qualities are.
<br />Jesus Himself had <span class="scripture">&#8220;no beauty that we should desire him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+53%3A2" title="Isaiah 53:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 53:2)</span></a></span>
<br />Man sees the outward, but God looks at the inward (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Samuel+16%3A7">I&nbsp;Samuel 16:7</a>).</li>

<li>What we see as &#8220;defects&#8221; can really be a special blessing from God.
<br />God&#8217;s strength is made perfect in our weakness (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+12%3A9-10">II&nbsp;Corinthians 12:9-10</a>).
<br />&#8220;Defects&#8221; can be ways of keeping us humble (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+1%3A27-31">I&nbsp;Corinthians 1:27-31</a>).</li>

<li>Our main purpose in life should be to glorify God with our life.
<br />We are to show Christ and His love to the world (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+2%3A9">I&nbsp;Peter 2:9</a>).
<br />We are to <span class="scripture">&#8220;shine as lights in the world.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+2%3A13-16" title="Philippians 2:13-16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 2:13-16)</span></a></span></li>

<li>It is a major testimony to the world when they see that we are able to accept the way God made us (without trying to mask or change it), and to actually praise Him for everything&#8212;even physical &#8220;defects.&#8221;</li>

</ol>
<p><b>Jewelry:</b> I believe God is not glorified when I wear jewelry, which only has the purpose of &#8220;beautifying&#8221; or drawing attention to my body. Instead, I want to focus on making my &#8220;meek and quiet spirit&#8221; (I Pet.3:3-5) and my &#8220;good works&#8221; (I Tim. 2:9-10), the things that people notice first about me. Inward qualities are what really matters in the light of eternity, anyway, and I don&#8217;t want to let myself be distracted, or be a stumbling block.</p>

<p>I have yet to find a good, Godly purpose for wearing jewelry (other than things like watches, belt buckles, and hair clips, which some people classify as jewelry)&#8230;&#8203;Christians are certainly not commanded to wear things solely for the purpose of physical adornment. As with make-up, I think it would be easy (for me, personally) to become more and more consumed with jewelry, and end up spending a great deal of time and money on it. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve decided to not wear any jewelry that doesn&#8217;t have a good function &#8212; I always wear a watch and hair clips, but that&#8217;s all. It does simplify things.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s some additional principles and verses on the subject (a few are the same as above):</p>

<ol>
<li>Outward &#8220;beauty&#8221; is not necessary for happiness&#8212;but Godly inward qualities are.
<br />Jesus Himself had <span class="scripture">&#8220;no beauty that we should desire him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+53%3A2" title="Isaiah 53:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 53:2)</span></a></span>

<li>Jewelry is worn for the purpose of adorning our bodies&#8212;we should focus on making our inner selves and our spirits the most noticable thing about ourselves.
<br />The best &#8220;adornment&#8221; is a <span class="scripture">&#8220;meek and quiet spirit.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A3-5" title="I&nbsp;Peter 3:3-5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 3:3-5)</span></a></span>

<li>Most jewelry distracts from the testimony God would have us be&#8212;and that causes harm in the light of eternity.</li>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">The following is in response to the last letter:</p>
</div>


<blockquote><p class="first">Ultimately, it is the condition of the heart and whether we have the meek and quiet spirit of Jesus that makes us modest or not, and our inward spirit will manifest itself by outward action.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>May I make a quick comment? Not trying to argue or anything, but just something that I thought of&#8230;. In what I quoted above, you wrote &#8220;and our inward spirit will manifest itself by outward action.&#8221; My thought is: if we have an inward spirit of beauty shouldn&#8217;t that beauty manifest itself outward not just in what we do, but how we look? Shouldn&#8217;t the beauty within us overflow into everything else? God gave people, especially women, the desire of beauty. Yes, it can consume us, and yes, there needs to be a balance, but I don&#8217;t think there is something wrong with looking pretty if we aren&#8217;t obsessed with it or proud of it.</p>

<p>This is something I think about now and then because sometimes I wonder if I care too little about my &#8220;beauty.&#8221; I don&#8217;t believe we should be sloppy. Sometimes I wonder if I should wear make-up or wear jewelry more because I do represent Christ. I don&#8217;t worry about it too much and I do try to keep myself reasonable (ie. keep my hair brushed, teeth clean, etc.).</p>

<p>One more thing, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as braided hair and the wearing of gold jewelry and fine clothes. Instead, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God&#8217;s sight.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A3-4" title="I&nbsp;Peter 3:3-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 3:3-4)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New International Version">NIV</span> In the NASB it says it a little differently&#8230;&#8203;<span class="scripture">&#8220;And let not your adornment be merely external&#8212;braiding the hair, and wearing gold jewelry, or putting on dresses; but let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God.&#8221;</span><span class="script_ver" title="New American Standard Bible">NASB</span> This seems to be saying to me that we need to be more concerned about the hidden person of the heart than the outward adornment, but I don&#8217;t see it saying to neglect the outward.</p>

<p>Okay, point made. I just want to say that I respect your convictions&#8230;&#8203;and if this is the way God has led you, then so be it, don&#8217;t let me get in your way with what God has shown me for myself.</p>

<p>For those of you who have no conviction in this area, seek the Lord, read His Word. He will guide you in the way He wants you to go.</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Readers,</p>

<p>We thought this topic for discussion was very interesting. We are sisters not only in the Lord but in the same family and thought we would combine our thoughts at the beginning and then share a bit of personal testimony individually at the end. We pray this will be a blessing to you. We look forward to reading other&#8217;s opinions on this as well. We have talked about these things off and on over the years within our family, as we have met new people and been exposed to different situations. As Christians, it seems worthy of discussion.</p>

<p>When we have a question about how we as believers should live, our first step should always be to go to the Word of God and see what our Heavenly Father has to say about it. There are Old Testament scriptures that would seem to support the wearing of jewelry and even perhaps the wearing of make-up as well. When we look at New Testament scriptures they may seem to contradict each other. We all know though, that the Word of God does not contradict itself. We must then take the Word of God overall and look at it as a whole rather than pick one scripture here or there to support our view. We would like to share what we feel God&#8217;s Word says concerning this subject and how we&#8217;ve been led.</p>

<p>The questions were very helpful to us when considering this issue. We would like to try to answer some of them.</p>

<p>We do definitely feel the Bible teaches a standard of Godly dress. We firmly believe that one can find God&#8217;s heart on the matter of dress. There are room for preferences and culture, but modesty cannot be dimmed by either. God wants each of His children to be modest. These scriptures are probably very familiar to many of you.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+2%3A9-10" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 2:9-10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 2:9-10)</span></a></span>
Most of you would agree that women who profess godliness should dress modestly. Just what does modesty mean? Modesty, according to &#8220;The American College Dictionary&#8221; (1958 version), means &#8220;a conformity to propriety and decoram; a becoming shyness, sobriety and proper behavior; quiet simplicity. Distaste for anything coarse or loud; free from vanity, egotism, boastfulness.&#8221; Many of us would apply this to our clothing and perhaps stop there. This scripture goes on to address jewelry. It specifically says to not adorn ourselves with gold or pearls or costly clothing. While many are quick to &#8220;dress&#8221; modestly, should we not apply the whole scripture? These scriptures are speaking to believers and seem to us to be giving specific directions. When applying make-up, does vanity and pride enter in? Are we not pleased with how God has made us? When putting on our jewelry, what are we thinking? We have to ask ourselves, are we trying to attract someone&#8217;s attention? God says our beauty should be in the hidden person of the heart, the incorruptible beauty of a meek and quiet spirit.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting of the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A3-4" title="I&nbsp;Peter 3:3-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 3:3-4)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Some would say that we shouldn&#8217;t put so much emphasis on the outside appearance. Make-up and jewelry are unimportant issues. It is the inner man that counts. We see it as what&#8217;s on the inside will show on the outside. What is in our heart? <span class="scripture">&#8220;A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+6%3A45" title="Luke 6:45"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 6:45)</span></a></span> We must ask ourselves, am I so concerned with how others see me as opposed to how God has chosen to make me? Are my eyes too small, my nose too big, lips not full enough? Do we need to feel we must be pretty and attractive to be accepted? Do we need to add adornments to God&#8217;s creation to improve it? Is God not pleased with how He made us? Who are we trying to please, if not God? Some say a little make-up is okay or just some simple earrings, not a lot. We ask, how much is too much? How can we know what is &#8220;over jewelry&#8221; or too much make-up, and is it up to us to decide? This will give ground to a very indefinite line. Too much to one might not be too much to another. We choose to forgo it all in an effort to obey our Lord and not be a stumbling block to anyone.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s consider what we read above in I Timothy and II Peter to what we see in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+17%3A4">Revelation 17:4</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8220;And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication.&#8221;</span> This is quite a contrast isn&#8217;t it? The women who profess godliness compared to the Babylonian harlot. Also in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+23%3A40">Ezekiel 23:40</a> and <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+4%3A30">Jeremiah 4:30</a> which refer to the harlotries and whoredom of Israel in their relationship to the Lord mention is made of jewelry and painting of the eyes. <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Kings+9%3A30">II&nbsp;Kings 9:30</a> refers to Jezebel and how she painted her face. These are definitely not things believers should want to be associated with.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. Abstain from all appearance of evil. And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+5%3A21-23" title="I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:21-23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:21-23)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>We would also like to address how the world looks at the issues of make-up and jewelry. It seems that both are very important. Most women wouldn&#8217;t consider even leaving their home without some make-up on. It would be awful if someone would see what they <i>really</i> looked like. They want to cover their true selves. Make others think they&#8217;re something they&#8217;re not (just think of the words <i>make up</i> themselves). This is being false which is contrary to what Christianity is all about. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+14%3A6" title="John 14:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 14:6)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+17%3A17" title="John 17:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 17:17)</span></a></span> Worldly women are afraid of looking older. Christian women are honored as they age and because of their wisdom are encouraged to teach the younger women.</p>

<p>Jewelry is not only adorning the flesh but a status symbol. How much, how big, how glittery. Again, those who say small amounts of jewelry are all right for believers to wear must consider where is the line between too much and acceptable amounts. Who&#8217;s to say? Is it not better to just take God at His word? Let&#8217;s remember what the scripture says especially about jewelry and the Christian. It goes without saying that if women are to have a particular standard, how much more so the men who are the heads of the home? Do we as believers want to be associated with the world and it&#8217;s desires? <span class="scripture">&#8220;Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+2%3A12" title="Titus 2:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Titus 2:12)</span></a></span></p>

<p>From Stephanie (age 18): Over the years as the Lord has led my family more and more in the ways of simplicity and holiness, He&#8217;s led us away from wearing jewelry and make-up. I praise the Lord I was too young to wear make-up and that it has never been an issue in my life. My mom did wear make-up. It was important to her and a very hard thing for her <i>flesh</i> to give up. I did wear jewelry and enjoyed wearing it. When I did stop wearing jewelry, I don&#8217;t remember having the Lord convict me personally on it. I stopped because my parents asked me to. Its importance to me had become less and less over time. It didn&#8217;t really matter to me if I wore it or not. My friends didn&#8217;t wear jewelry and make-up, so I didn&#8217;t have any feelings of being a &#8220;loner&#8221; or rebellion because I couldn&#8217;t be like my friends. Many of them were older than me and thus were &#8220;old enough&#8221; by the world&#8217;s standards to wear make-up. As I&#8217;ve grown in the Lord, I&#8217;ve developed a conviction, a working of the Lord in my heart, that wearing jewelry (and make-up) isn&#8217;t for me to do. The scriptures seem very clear to me. There was never any question as to what God would want me to do. I also thank the Lord that I haven&#8217;t been persecuted because I don&#8217;t wear jewelry and make-up. I desire to please and obey Him. My family has only received encouraging comments on how we (my sister and I especially) are different than most girls and that it is very refreshing for them to see. My mom, sister, and I cover our heads, so even our hair isn&#8217;t distracting. Our countenances are clearly seen. The Lord has made me exactly how He wants me to be. His ways are perfect. Why would I want to try to improve on His perfect design with make-up or adorning it with jewelry?</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother&#8217;s womb. I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvelous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well. My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+139%3A13-16" title="Psalm 139:13-16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 139:13-16)</span></a></span></p>

<p>From Elisabeth (age 15): My personal thoughts concerning make-up and jewelry are very much based on whether or not I should be a stumbling block to my brothers and sisters in the Lord. If I should wear even what I would consider a small amount of make-up and jewelry how can I know that it wouldn&#8217;t trip others up and hinder their walk with the Lord? What if it caused my sister to slip more toward the world and wear more just because &#8220;Elisabeth does.&#8221; What if I caused my brother to lust? This is a very serious thing. The Lord would require it of my hand on the judgement day. How much better to stand with a clear conscience!</p>

<p>I also feel that contentment is linked with this. Make-up is worn to &#8220;enhance.&#8221; Why should I want to &#8220;enhance&#8221; this piece of dust&#8212;only worth anything because of Christ? Should I be discontent with the way God so miraculously made me? Rather, I should praise God for giving me what I have. I should thank Him for even giving me eyes, a mouth, ears, and hair. I should be exceedingly happy with every thing God has bestowed on me, rather than fuss over them. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+4%3A11" title="Philippians 4:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 4:11)</span></a></span></p>

<p>I pray that we all would come to realize that the greatest ornament of all is a meek and quiet spirit. It is, indeed, of a great price.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+5%3A2-3" title="I&nbsp;John 5:2-3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 5:2-3)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>May God reveal His will to you all. We love you with the love of Christ and hope that somehow we have been an encouragement in your walk with the Savior.</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters in Christ Jesus,</p>

<p>All my life I have been taught that it was wrong to wear make-up and jewelry, but I never knew why. But when I got sanctified, the Lord opened my eyes and showed me why it was wrong. (I have never worn it but I used to have the desire to wear it). I hope this will help your stand against make-up and jewelry.</p>

<p>Usually when a lady puts on jewelry or make-up it is to look more attractive. (But the shine of God and the world clash so badly that they cannot go together.) I would rather have the shine of God than to have the glitter of this world.</p>

<p>Have you ever thought of hair stuff being jewelry? It can be! Ask yourself these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do I wear big bows, fancy barrettes, etc.?</li>

<li>Do I feel the Holy Ghost around when I wear them?</li>

<li>How do I feel when I wear them?</li>

<li>How is your hair any different from the world&#8217;s? (we are to be set apart)</li>

<li>Do I wear that kind of hair stuff to look like the world?</li>

<li>Do I desire the world and its things? (these fit with earrings, rings, etc., and make-up)</li>

</ul>
<p>Pray and let God show you these things. God knows what is best for you.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+1%3A10" title="Galatians 1:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 1:10)</span></a></span>

<p>&#8212;A Sister in Christ</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p class="noindent">Dear Fellow-Pilgrims,</p>

<p>My heart skipped a beat as I read about the discussion which was going to be held on jewelry and make-up. Being a former jewelry and make-up wearer, I knew instantly that God would have me to share. I put it off, and then I put it off some more. Still it seemed like I had that nagging feeling that could not be quenched out by my &#8220;human reasons&#8221; for not partaking in the discussion. And so with prayer, I feel like now is the time, this rainy Monday afternoon, to sit and write. I share my own testimony and conclusions about the matter not to offend, but with the prayer that someone, somewhere, would benefit.</p>

<p>What is modesty?</p>

<p>Bashful, becoming, chaste, civil, compliant, conventional, decent, decorous, deferential, demure, diffident, discreet, dutiful, forbearing, gentle, humble, humiliating, inconsiderable, innocent, insignificant, limited, lowly, maidenly, meek, mild, moderate, moral, patient, phlegmatic, placid, proper, pure, quiet, reasonable, refined, reserved, retiring, self-effacing, serene, shameful, sheepish, sheep-like, shy, simple, soft, subdued, submissive, tame, timid, tolerant, tranquil, unassertive, unassuming, unproud, unprovocative, unprovoking, virtuous, yielding.</p>

<p>A mouthful, I know! Let&#8217;s zero in on a few: Decent. Demure. Discreet. Moderate. Pure. Reasonable. Reserved. Unassuming. Unpretentious. Unprovocative.</p>

<p>My cry is to be a modest young woman. Holding up jewelry and make-up with those words makes the shining jewels and the colorful lipstick look ugly. If I am to be an unassuming, unpretentious, unprovocative girl, what am I doing thinking about adorning myself in such? God&#8217;s will for women is <span class="scripture">&#8220;that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+2%3A9" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 2:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 2:9)</span></a></span></p>

<p>It is a miracle I am writing these words. Just a few short years ago I would have sneered at the thought. I loved my jewelry. My favorite glittering necklace was always around my neck. My hands never were without rings and nail-polish. My wrists never were bare; my macramed bracelets clung to them.</p>

<p>My family was becoming more and more plain. Mom and my sister did not wear jewelry. They tried to reason with me, but I brushed them off. &#8220;God wants me to be beautiful, doesn&#8217;t He? No sense in becoming an old maid. Besides, I don&#8217;t wear them to look good. They have sentimental value to me.&#8221; My excuses ran on and on. I soon stopped wearing gold and pearls. &#8220;The Bible says nothing about silver or sapphires, you know,&#8221; I&#8217;d say clasping on my silver jewelry. I had already given up my jeans; I was <i>not</i> going to give up my jewelry&#8212;or so I thought.</p>

<p>I was at a Christian retreat for a week. I sat smugly in the pew all &#8220;dolled&#8221; up. The preacher began to speak on how jewelry accents a woman&#8217;s beauty. He was not degrading jewelry. He was not putting it in a negative light. In fact, he seemed to rather like the idea of women being more attractive. God used that to smite my heart. I fingered my silver necklace and thought, &#8220;God doesn&#8217;t want me to be wearing this.&#8221; It seemed so clear. I rushed back to my cabin afterwards and with shaking hands unclasped my necklace and slid off my ring.</p>

<p>That was the last time I wore jewelry.</p>

<p>My family had been telling me for so long that jewelry was not right. I read the &#8220;evils&#8221; of jewelry and make-up in countless tracts and booklets. Nothing ever penetrated. It all fell on a deaf ear until God woke me up and said, &#8220;Lauren, this is not My will.&#8221; It all seemed so cut and dry, black and white after that night. &#8220;God wants me to adorn myself with modesty. He wants me to be beautiful on the inside. He doesn&#8217;t want me to be a stumbling block for my brothers. He wants me to be modest,&#8221; I thought to myself over and over. There was such peace in my heart!</p>

<p>It has been three years since I stopped wearing jewelry and make-up. I can look back and ask myself, &#8220;What were my motives for putting on such things?&#8221; The world says it&#8217;s necessary to be beautiful. And its solution? Jewelry and make-up. I didn&#8217;t question it. It&#8217;s just how it was. I blindly followed. But as a Christian, I do not look at the world as my standard. I look at God&#8217;s Word. God tells me in His Word that I am not to be adorned with jewelry. I am to be modest.</p>

<p>God <i>does</i> want His daughters to be beautiful, but with a different kind of beauty. The world offers beauty in a bottle; earthly, sensual, and fleeting. God offers true beauty; heavenly, pure, and lasting. Having a beautiful inner man will cause you to glow from within. It is much easier to brush on some rouge, dab on lipstick, and clasp on a necklace; but it is far more lasting to cultivate that quiet and meek spirit which is of great worth in God&#8217;s sight.</p>

<p>I have suffered mild persecution for not following the world and what it dictates a young woman ought to look like. It is hard at times to face the scorn and the long stares from those that don&#8217;t understand why I dress modestly without any pomp. <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+12%3A1-2">Romans 12:1-2</a> comes to mind, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>To those who have decided to dress &#8220;plainly,&#8221; I would like to encourage you to keep pressing on. Even though people may scoff at your unpainted face and your simple dress, they will remember that there was a girl once who chose to give up worldly glamour for Christ. There was once a girl who was willing to take a stand and say no to the world&#8217;s &#8220;beauty in a bottle&#8221; and yes to God&#8217;s true beauty.</p>

<p>The women of the Old Testament adorned themselves with jewels. We do not have to do that. We now can adorn ourselves with Jesus. And, why, dear girls, would we want to adorn ourselves with anything else?</p>

<p class="signature">With great love for you, dear sisters,<br />Lauren Elizabeth Mong<br />West Virgina</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>My goal in life was to fit in with the world. I didn&#8217;t want to look different or be thought of as &#8220;weird&#8221; and so fought against my parents wishes and desires. I rebelled against the way that they had trained and raised me. Sometimes I would outwardly submit, but usually I got my own way. Was I happy? No.</p>

<p>Almost two years ago, the Lord began working on my heart. I purposed that I was going to honor Him, no matter what. From that point on, my life changed dramatically. No longer did I desire to follow the ways of the world. I wanted more than anything else to please the Lord. I spent much time in God&#8217;s Word and in prayer. I started examining every part of my life and holding it up to the light of Scripture. I realized that many things I did were contrary to the Word of God. They had no part in the life of the Christian, and the Lord gave me grace to let them go. Many of the things that had to go were things that I wore. First, it was the shorts and the pants and the immodest tops and dresses. As one by one these things were pruned from my life, I experienced such peace and joy and renewed assurance from the Lord that this was His will.</p>

<p>The Lord continued His pruning work. He started to convict me about my jewelry and make-up&#8212;something of this world I still clung to. I couldn&#8217;t ignore the tuggings upon my heart. As I examined jewelry and make-up, I realized that my only reasoning for wearing them was to be attractive and because I liked them. It was like the humanistic mentality, &#8220;If it feels good, do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I began thinking about <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A3-4">I&nbsp;Peter 3:3-4</a> which says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.&#8221;</span> God is much more concerned with my heart than my outward appearance. Jewelry and make-up take time, and they also often cause distraction from Eternal things. Satan would love to have us young ladies get caught up in temporal things.</p>

<p>Even though the Lord has led me to not wear make-up and jewelry, I am not going to condemn you for wearing it. I do challenge you to question yourself, &#8220;Why am I doing this?&#8221; We are so influenced by society nowadays. We nonchalantly accept what our forefathers would have blatantly protested against as wicked. Let us not measure our lives by the world&#8217;s standards; we will always come out okay. Let us be willing to measure our lives by the standards set in God&#8217;s Word. In eternity, we won&#8217;t regret it.</p>

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>After all these thoughts, opinions, ideas, testimonies, scriptures&#8212;some agreeing, some disagreeing&#8212;what do we conclude? Many have expressed their thoughts and ended with&#8212;&#8220;but don&#8217;t let me stand in the way of what God is telling you&#8212;even if it is different from what He is showing me.&#8221; Do we, then, simply conclude that we have liberty to pick and choose what we like and what we think God may be telling us? Is there not any lasting Truth on this line that cannot be altered? What is Truth? God&#8217;s own Holy Word, written and inspired by Him most High, is Truth. Man&#8217;s interpretations do not alter its Sovereignty and absoluteness. If we do not believe and take it as Truth, it remains the same and will prove true to the end. God has been gracious to us to give us His Word&#8212;it is our Guide, our light and only hope. We have the privilege of taking everything to God in His Word and finding the answer we desire. We can measure any line of thought, any doctrine, any idea to the Word of God and may find if it is Truth. You may ask, &#8220;How can we do this? We are in the flesh. We can get things wrong. We cannot correctly interpret. We must just do the best we can to understand it and not judge others.&#8221; How did Brothers John, Paul, Peter, Matthew, Mark write it down correctly? They were human and in the flesh. They were subject to mistakes and human thinking. How could they write down God&#8217;s own Word? The Lord gave it to them. He inspired them and filled them&#8212;they were simply vessels He chose. He did the writing through these vessels of clay. I believe God wants to do the same with us. He wants us to have His mind and be filled with Him, inspired by Him that we might understand His Word&#8212;the Guidebook. After all, my dear sisters, if this is to be a Guidebook to show us safely the way home while we are on our pilgrimage, what good is it if we cannot understand it? We might miss the way home, simply by ignorance of the Book, not heeding our Father&#8217;s words,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A15" title="2 Timothy 2:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (2 Timothy 2:15)</span></a></span>
That is what we are here to do today. We have a strong desire to rightly divide the Word of the Lord and trust you do, also. May the Lord shine His light upon us as we search for His Truth.</p>

<p>A good many of you have asked, &#8220;What is the motive in wearing jewelry?&#8221; That is a good place to start. Why are we doing what we are doing? We are daughters of the King, journeying on our way to our blissful eternal home. We are pilgrims and strangers here in a foreign land. We have found that it is customary in this foreign land for women to paint their faces and adorn themselves with jewels of the country. We have looked in our Guidebook and have found that in the Old Testament many Godly women wore these same jewels and painted their own faces. We find, as some have pointed out, that in the NewTestament it seems to be condemned, making scripture appear to contradict itself. Does God &#8220;double cross&#8221; Himself?</p>

<p>Let us take a moment and step back, looking at the differences between the Old and the New. Their very names suggest something&#8212;&#8220;Old&#8221; and &#8220;New.&#8221; In the Old Testament, God had a visible people, the Israelites; they had a visible country to which they were going&#8212;Canaan. The Israelites were God&#8217;s chosen people, set apart for a purpose. There were other people in the world&#8212;for instance, the Chinese or the Indians&#8212;but the Bible does not speak of them (regarding special dealings by God) or how God helped them fight their battles. The Israelites were very much a special people&#8212;they worshiped the living God, they did not sacrifice their children to idols as did other heathen nations. They wore special clothing that set them apart and their women were very beautiful. Everything about them that set them apart was visible. However their hearts were the same sinful hearts that the Mongolians had&#8212;they were not regenerated and could not be in the New Testament sense. Yes, God had a set-apart people, but He was not satisfied. God, in the beginning, created man upright, pure and holy, sinless, with a perfect heart and He wanted a people that was the same. Yes, the Israelites conformed, outwardly&#8212;at least at times&#8212;but God wanted to go to every human heart and, <span class="scripture">&#8220;whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+22%3A17" title="Revelation 22:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 22:17)</span></a></span> Out of that group of people&#8212;&#8220;whosoever will&#8221;&#8212;He wanted each individual to have a perfect heart before Him, who obeyed Him from this perfect heart. A people, who, when their hearts were right, He could adorn with meekness, quietness, love, joy, and peace&#8212;true beauty. The Israelites did not have this perfect heart, and could not be adorned in this way; so instead they used substitutes of this fading world. God accepted this substitute, knowing that He had given them nothing better at that time.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+7%3A19" title="Hebrews 7:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 7:19)</span></a></span> I am sure you know the sweet story and how He did bring about our Wonderful, Blessed Messiah so we are privileged to be adorned with the rare (in the sense that many people do not accept them) jewels that Jesus offers. Dear girls, are we going to forsake God&#8217;s perfect way? Let us not want to go back to the old covenant and hope that God will accept its inadequacy. <b>We have something better.</b> It was bought and paid by Jesus for us. The world, in its unregenerated heart state, endorses, nay, demands, the beautifying practices to cover up for its sad heart condition. They paint their faces, deck themselves with jewels and say, &#8220;Look how beautiful I am!&#8221; They are living for beauty of this world, which will fade; they are investing in earthly treasures which will pass away and burn. Dear sisters, do we really want to dress in their apparel? Shall we exchange our shining robe of white for their glittering gaudy one which shall be as the grass of the field, which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven? Shall we say, &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter&#8212;we are on our way to the King,&#8221; but shall we meet Him in this earth&#8217;s soiled garment? If we take such a course, I am afraid, my sisters, we shall indeed meet the King, only to be turned away, though we have done many good works in His name. I want to be ready when He comes to transfer me to my Heavenly, everlasting home. I do not want Him to find me unprepared, and go to face eternity with the great deceiver and enemy, the devil. Dear girls, please don&#8217;t take the attitude it doesn&#8217;t matter&#8212;it does. Please don&#8217;t say, &#8220;I respect your convictions, but I&#8217;m not really sure&#8230;&#8203;I don&#8217;t think it really hurts as long as you don&#8217;t overdo it.&#8221; Look in the Bible. Search until you hear from God. If your heart isn&#8217;t right and you find that you cannot give up this world&#8217;s glory, dear sister, pray until you are clear. You will not regret it. Eternity is a long time. As I&#8217;ve said before, our choices determine where we spend the remainder of our lives. Please don&#8217;t let jewelry and make-up bar you from heaven&#8212;earth, this world, popular opinion about beauty&#8212;it will all fade. God&#8217;s Word will not. The Lord doesn&#8217;t want us to look beautiful for Him with Belial&#8217;s raiment. Leave off the excuses. Forget your own ideas&#8212;seek God.</p>

<p>By God&#8217;s grace, I mean to be there on the other side, rejoicing, when that Day comes at last. My dear sisters, you will be there on that last day, too. What side will you be on? Will you have any regrets? When you face God, will you be happy? Will you have wished that you had given up the world for God&#8217;s ways? Or will you be praising Him for the grace He gave you to stand true?</p>


<p>I know a dear sister who has measured up to God&#8217;s Word in this area. She has a sweet spirit that just shines&#8212;a true jewel indeed. She is being persecuted by those around her and the pressure is very great at times. She has her eyes on Jesus, on heaven for eternity&#8212;she said, &#8220;It will be worth it over there.&#8221; And she is right. She is happy; she is singing and rejoicing. You can have that experience too, despite persecutions or smaller things like strange stares at the grocery store or cutting remarks from family members. Should we be surprised to be misunderstood and rejected by the world-loving throng? Do we think we can have it easy when our Master and Lord walked the rough road and the stones we laid in the way cut His feet? Would we want to have it easy? Oh, Lord give us what it takes to follow Thee all the way! To give as much as You require, and keep our eyes on heaven and home. It will be worth it there.</p>
