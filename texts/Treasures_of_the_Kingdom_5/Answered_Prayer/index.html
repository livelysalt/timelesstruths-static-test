<blockquote><p class="first">A true story about the orphan girls that lived at Mama Stewart&#8217;s shelter in India. Adapted for younger readers from <i>Highways and Hedges</i>, by Grace G. Henry.</p>
</blockquote>


<h1>Answered Prayer</h1>

<p>One time, during World War I, there was no meat in the Girls&#8217; Home. After awhile the girls grew very hungry for it. They knew that the hard times were because of the war, so they didn&#8217;t complain to Mama or any of the workers about it. But a group of the older girls, from ten to fourteen years old, got together and went far out under some shade trees. There they all prayed together, telling their Heavenly Father all about their desire. They had full confidence that He would grant their request.</p>

<p>First they asked the Lord to either send money or meat. But after considering it awhile, one of them said to the others, &#8220;But, girls, if God sends money, Mama will not know it is for meat. Since there are so many needs, she will surely buy something else with it.&#8221; So everyone prayed again and asked the Lord not to send money, but to send meat.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_5/answered_basket.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="152" /></div>
<p>For two days the girls stayed near the house to watch for the meat. Many times Mama suggested that they go stay in the shade since it was hot, but to no avail. About noon of the second day, a man came to the house with a large basket on his head. The girls listened from the back veranda to see what he would say to Mama. How happy they were to hear that he had brought meat for them, and their prayer was fully answered!</p>

<p>Mama praised the Lord with them when she heard of how they had taken their desire before the Lord and then waited for the promised answer.</p>

<p>The next day Mama went to thank the lady who had been used of God to help answer their prayer. As Mama told how earnestly they had prayed and waited the two days in faith, the lady wept bitter tears. &#8220;Miss Stewart,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I am so ashamed of myself.&#8221; Then she told what had happened.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_5/answered_thankful.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="250" /></div>
<p>Her family owned two sheep and cared for them as pets. Two days before she had sent the meat, God had told her to have a certain one of the sheep butchered and the meat sent over to the Girls&#8217; Home. She had refused to do this. The next morning, when she opened the door of the sheep pen, she found that this same sheep was lying dead on the floor. She knew that God had made it die because she had not obeyed Him, and kept it instead. At once, she and her husband called a butcher to kill and fix the meat of the other sheep, so that it could be sent to the Girls&#8217; Home.</p>

<p>So God again proved His faithfulness to answer prayer, though it was just children who had told their wishes to Him. Hasn&#8217;t He said that the desires of the righteous shall be granted? Yes, even children can love and serve the Lord, and He will hear their prayers and answer them. If the answer is sometimes delayed, never stop believing.
