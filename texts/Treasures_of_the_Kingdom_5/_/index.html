<h1>The Stormy Day</h1>

<p>Rosie frowned at herself in the mirror. &#8220;Wish I had curly hair,&#8221; she said as big sister Irene began on her second braid. &#8220;Janice has curls, and everyone says she&#8217;s pretty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Meg said that Janice doesn&#8217;t like them, &#8217;cause it hurts to brush them out,&#8221; said Irene.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still, they&#8217;re prettier,&#8221; Rosie said with a pout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better not try to be pretty then,&#8221; suggested Irene. &#8220;It&#8217;s better to be thankful about things.&#8221; Rosie knew that, but she didn&#8217;t feel like being thankful this morning. She felt gloomy because it was raining when she had been hoping for snow. When it had snowed before, she had been too sick to go outside, and so everyone else had had fun without her. Rosie frowned more as she remembered it.</p>

<p>Emma poked her little face around the door. &#8220;Rosie! Mama wants you,&#8221; she said, with a smile. Rosie didn&#8217;t feel like smiling back. In her heart she knew Jesus wanted her to be cheerful, but what was there to smile about?</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t feel any happier when she saw what Mom wanted. &#8220;Why do I always have to do the dishes?&#8221; she complained as she stepped up on the stool in front of the sink.</p>

<p>&#8220;They need to be cleaned,&#8221; Mom said, &#8220;and I want my children to learn to be good workers. Besides, you don&#8217;t <i>always</i> do the dishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosie didn&#8217;t answer. She was thinking of Cousin Janice&#8217;s birthday party yesterday. Janice had gotten so many nice things, including some new roller-blades. They had tried them out on her covered porch and they had worked wonderfully. &#8220;Mom,&#8221; Rosie said after a little while, &#8220;I wish I could have some roller-blades like Janice got.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? You have roller skates, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; Mom stopped rolling pie crust and turned around. &#8220;You need to be content with what you have, my child.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosie swished her hands slowly in the dishwater. &#8220;But they don&#8217;t go as fast as hers,&#8221; she mumbled. She knew Mom wouldn&#8217;t take that as a good excuse, but it <i>did</i> seem like everyone else had things better than she did.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rose Alice.&#8221; Mom&#8217;s voice was very quiet, but Rosie knew she was not pleased. &#8220;I want you to stop complaining about everything. You are not having a good attitude this morning. Do you think Jesus is pleased?&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_5/stormy_window.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></div>
<p>Rosie shook her head slowly and bit her lip. Why was everything going wrong today? She looked out the window and was surprised to see how dark it had become. The tall firs were waving in the wind and dark clouds covered the sky. Suddenly the light flickered and went out.</p>

<p>Mom hurried out to check on the little children, but Rosie stood still on her little stool in the dark kitchen. She looked out at the waving black branches against the silver sky and felt prickles creep up her back.</p>

<p>Lifting her wet hands, she clasped them together and closed her eyes. &#8220;Dear Father in Heaven,&#8221; she said in a whisper, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for&#8212;for being grumpy &#8217;bout everything. Help me be good&#8212;and&#8212;and take care of us.&#8221; As she slipped her hands back into the warm dishwater and swished them around for the dishrag, a little smile came to her face. The room wasn&#8217;t so dark anymore, and everything was still and peaceful in the kitchen. Outside it began to pour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rosie, dear,&#8221; Mom said, coming in with Kyle, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to hurt yourself. I&#8217;ll finish the dishes and you go with the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; Rosie said. &#8220;There&#8217;s only a few bowls left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, dear,&#8221; Mom said softly. Rosie looked up at her mother&#8217;s kind face and smiled.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t until almost lunch time before the lights came on again, so they spent the morning around the wood stove. Mom lit a kerosene lamp and read them stories. Rosie sat on a little footstool and listened eagerly. One story made her feel very sorry, for it was about a family in a flood. The water came into the house, and they had to climb into the attic so they wouldn&#8217;t drown. At the very end, some rescuers came and saved them all, just in time.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_5/stormy_lamp.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="168" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think we have much to be thankful for?&#8221; Mama said, looking around at them all in the lamplight. &#8220;They lost all they had, but they still were thankful to be alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosie looked at the shadows on the wall and thought about how much she <i>did</i> have. There were many, many things she was thankful for, especially her dear family. She blinked her eyes as she remembered how she had complained only an hour ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mama,&#8221; said Rosie, as she flung her arms around her mother&#8217;s neck, &#8220;I am so sorry for not being a thankful girl!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I forgive you,&#8221; Mom said as she gave her a warm squeeze. &#8220;I love you very much, and I know a thankful girl is always a happy one.&#8221;</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_5/How_to_be_Happy/index.html">How to be Happy</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>How to be Happy</h1>

<p>Have you ever had a day like Rosie&#8217;s? Everything wasn&#8217;t the way you wanted it to be, and so you didn&#8217;t feel happy. How do you think this happens? It starts with a little wishing thought. Maybe someone else has something better than you do. You began to wish for it, and soon you can think of many other things you don&#8217;t have. Then you began to feel grumpy and a pout comes to your face. This is called being discontented. You are not happy with what you have or can do, and it makes you feel miserable.</p>

<p>Do you think that Jesus is happy when we are this way? There is a Bible verse that tells us:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+13%3A5" title="Hebrews 13:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 13:5)</span></a></span>
Who will never leave us? The Lord Jesus! One cure for being discontent is remembering this promise. Since Jesus is always near, and He knows just what we need, then we should just trust Him to take care of us. It makes Him very sad when we complain and grumble, for that means we don&#8217;t believe this promise. It means we don&#8217;t believe that the Lord can take care of us! What a silly thing to think!</p>

<p>Another thing to do when you begin to think some complaining thoughts is to give thanks. There are many verses in the Bible about being thankful. If you want to look them up, here are a few:
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+92%3A1">Psalm 92:1</a>,
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A20">Ephesians 5:20</a>,
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+3%3A15">Colossians 3:15</a>, and
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+5%3A18">I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:18</a>.
There are many good things you do have, if you stop to think about it. What about your home and family? What about a bed to sleep in and food to eat? It is God who has given us all good things, and it makes Jesus happy when we remember to keep thankfulness in our heart toward Him.</p>

<p>What was the thing that helped Rosie to be thankful? She began thinking about someone else. When you stop thinking about yourself and think about others, you are much happier. Selfishness makes many people very gloomy. Though it never does any good, it is hard to stop thinking about our own wants. We need to ask Jesus to help us. Jesus learned how to give up His own way and try to make others happy. You can learn that, too. Look for ways to cheer others up. Many people don&#8217;t have happy homes and the blessings that you do. When you think about them, it helps you to be thankful for what you have.</p>

<p>If you start wishing that you had more toys and didn&#8217;t have to work, you should remember that these things don&#8217;t make people happy. Happiness comes when you have Jesus. When you obey Him, you will have a happy heart. He always makes people happy, and He can help you to be a little sunbeam, too!</p>

<h1>Start Your Own Vegetables</h1>

<p>This year we are going to learn about growing things in the garden. The King has many things to teach us from His plants, so let us keep our eyes and ears open!</p>

<p>We will begin by starting some vegetables inside. For most of us, it is too cold to grow things outside at this time. Plants need four important ingredients to grow: warmth, water, soil, and light. Remember this when we start our plants.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_5/vegetables_1.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></div>
<p>There are many vegetables you can start inside, but we will begin with tomatoes and lettuce. To start them we will need some containers. Margarine tubs or paper cups work well if you punch a few holes in the bottom. Now mix the soil with a little warm water in a bowl to make it moist. Potting soil from the store is best for starting seeds. That is because it doesn&#8217;t have any weed seeds or disease that will grow in it. Fill your containers a little over half way with soil.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_5/vegetables_2.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></div>
<p>In each tomato or lettuce container, you can plant up to six or eight seeds. Plant the same amount of seeds as the plants you want. Press them carefully around so they are not touching each other. Cover the seeds with a little bit of soil. If you bury them too deep, they will not be able to find the light, but if you don&#8217;t cover them, they will get dry. Cover your containers with plastic wrap so that the soil will stay damp, and put them in a warm place.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_5/vegetables_3.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></div>
<p>Check your seeds every day to see if they are growing. As soon as you see a little stem pushing out of the soil, take off the plastic and move your containers into the light. If seedlings don&#8217;t get light, they will start looking for it, because light is what helps them grow. In the Bible, Jesus is called our Light. If we don&#8217;t come close to Him each day, we won&#8217;t grow in our hearts like we should.</p>

<p>Remember to water your plants. Just set them in a tray of water, and their little roots will reach down and suck it up. They will wilt and die without water. That is the same thing that happens to us if we don&#8217;t pray and read our Bible. If we don&#8217;t ask our Heavenly Father for love and strength each day, we will get into trouble.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_5/vegetables_4.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></div>
<p>When each seedling has four leaves, it is time to transplant them to their own containers. Count the seedlings, and fill that many containers with soil. Tall paper cups or half gallon milk cartons are best, because they have room for long roots. With a pencil, poke a hole into the soil. Carefully dig up a seedling and set it into the hole. Bury it so the leaves are right on top of the soil. Keep all your seedlings on a tray so you can water them easily. Watch them as they grow, and, by springtime, they will be ready for the garden!</p>

<h2>Be a Bird Watcher</h2>
<p>It is fun to watch birds at any time of year, but you can see them especially well in the winter. If you put out some food for them near your house, you can watch them from your window. When the weather is freezing, it is also good to give them a dish of water to drink from.</p>

<p>Try counting how many different kinds come. You can look them up in a bird guide to see what their names are. Soon you will be able to tell them apart easily.</p>

<p>Some birds eat on the ground, and some stay in the trees. Some birds like suet and sunflower seeds, but others like oats or millet. What do your feathered friends eat?</p>

<p>The birds you see in the winter are the kinds God designed to find food even in the cold. Many other birds have to migrate (move away) when winter comes. They go south, where it is warmer, until spring arrives, and there are enough insects and seeds for them to eat. So be on the look out for new birds when the weather warms up in the spring. It is fun to watch and see how God takes care of these little creatures.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Suet for Birds</h2>
<p>Melt in a saucepan on low heat:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>1/4 c. lard (keeps sun from melting it)</li>

<li>1/4 c. crunchy peanut butter</li>

</ul>
<p>Stir in:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>1/2 c. quick oats</li>

<li>1/2 c. cornmeal</li>

<li>1/4 c. white flour</li>

<li>1 T. sugar</li>

</ul>
<p>Pour 1-inch thick in freezer containers. Store in freezer or refrigerator until you are ready to hang out in a mesh or wire basket for the birds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time for a story!&#8221; Edward shouted, racing his brother and sister to Grandpa&#8217;s chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait for me,&#8221; little Sammy said, puffing up behind, &#8220;I want to hear, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one shall be left out,&#8221; said Grandpa, &#8220;each person has a place to help. Today I think I shall tell a story about a boy that helped Jesus. It is called:</p>

<h1>The Picnic on the Hilltop</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+6%3A1-13">John 6:1-13</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Long ago, during the time that Jesus walked the shores of Galilee, there lived a boy whom I will call Jared. Jared lived with his father and mother and two little sisters and baby brother in Capernaum. One day they heard that Jesus was teaching in the hills, so they decided to take a picnic lunch and go listen. So on a bright sunny morning they set out. Jared carried the picnic basket and was glad when they finally reached the crowded hilltop, for the basket was getting quite heavy. They picked a place that wasn&#8217;t so crowded, but close enough to hear Jesus, and sat down.</p>

<p>All morning Jesus taught the people, and many sick people came and were healed. Jared was fascinated* with the stories Jesus taught about the Kingdom of Heaven. He forgot all about their lunch until his sisters began to cry for something to eat. Then he noticed that it was getting late, for the sun was going down. Jared looked around and saw that few people had brought anything to eat. Opening the picnic basket, he looked at the two fried fish and five barley rolls his mother had packed for their lunch. His mouth watered; how good they would taste!</p>

<p>&#8220;Young lad,&#8221; said a man, bending near, &#8220;do you have some bread to share?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jared, a bit startled, noticed that it was one of Jesus&#8217; disciples. He looked again at the picnic lunch: there was hardly enough for themselves, and he was very hungry. But when he looked up the hillside at Jesus&#8217; kind face, Jared remembered how good He had been to them, healing the sick and telling stories.</p>

<p>Picking up the basket he handed it over to the man. &#8220;Here, give it to Jesus,&#8221; Jared said. The man took it, and Jared sat with no lunch at all. But he saw Jesus smile as He took the basket. To Jared&#8217;s surprise, He told the people to sit down in groups. When everyone was quiet, Jesus lifted the basket and asked a blessing for the food. What was Jesus planning to do?</p>

<p>Wide-eyed, Jared watched as Jesus began passing rolls to His disciples. Four, five, six&#8230;&#8203;and still there was more! Back and forth through the hungry crowds the food was passed. Soon Jared and his family were munching on fried fish and good, fresh barley rolls with everyone else. Why, this was the best food he&#8217;d ever tasted! Jared thought about their little lunch and was so glad he had given it to Jesus. When Jesus had prayed, there was enough for everyone!</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Sammy smiled as Grandpa finished the story. &#8220;Jesus can do anything!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but what did Jared have to do first?&#8221; Grandpa asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He gave his lunch,&#8221; said Edward.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s sort of like giving up our own way, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Alice said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Grandpa, &#8220;Jesus wants each of us to give what we have to Him: your toys to share, your hands to serve Him, your smile to cheer someone else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then Jesus can make something big out of it,&#8221; said Edward.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just like multiplication,&#8221; Alice said, &#8220;Jesus <i>multiplied</i> the lunch Jared gave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He surely did,&#8221; Grandpa agreed. &#8220;And He can multiply your little &#8216;lunches,&#8217; too. When you give them to Jesus, He can use it to bless everyone else!&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p class="first">A true story about the orphan girls that lived at Mama Stewart&#8217;s shelter in India. Adapted for younger readers from <i>Highways and Hedges</i>, by Grace G. Henry.</p>
</blockquote>


<h1>Answered Prayer</h1>

<p>One time, during World War I, there was no meat in the Girls&#8217; Home. After awhile the girls grew very hungry for it. They knew that the hard times were because of the war, so they didn&#8217;t complain to Mama or any of the workers about it. But a group of the older girls, from ten to fourteen years old, got together and went far out under some shade trees. There they all prayed together, telling their Heavenly Father all about their desire. They had full confidence that He would grant their request.</p>

<p>First they asked the Lord to either send money or meat. But after considering it awhile, one of them said to the others, &#8220;But, girls, if God sends money, Mama will not know it is for meat. Since there are so many needs, she will surely buy something else with it.&#8221; So everyone prayed again and asked the Lord not to send money, but to send meat.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_5/answered_basket.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="152" /></div>
<p>For two days the girls stayed near the house to watch for the meat. Many times Mama suggested that they go stay in the shade since it was hot, but to no avail. About noon of the second day, a man came to the house with a large basket on his head. The girls listened from the back veranda to see what he would say to Mama. How happy they were to hear that he had brought meat for them, and their prayer was fully answered!</p>

<p>Mama praised the Lord with them when she heard of how they had taken their desire before the Lord and then waited for the promised answer.</p>

<p>The next day Mama went to thank the lady who had been used of God to help answer their prayer. As Mama told how earnestly they had prayed and waited the two days in faith, the lady wept bitter tears. &#8220;Miss Stewart,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I am so ashamed of myself.&#8221; Then she told what had happened.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_5/answered_thankful.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="250" /></div>
<p>Her family owned two sheep and cared for them as pets. Two days before she had sent the meat, God had told her to have a certain one of the sheep butchered and the meat sent over to the Girls&#8217; Home. She had refused to do this. The next morning, when she opened the door of the sheep pen, she found that this same sheep was lying dead on the floor. She knew that God had made it die because she had not obeyed Him, and kept it instead. At once, she and her husband called a butcher to kill and fix the meat of the other sheep, so that it could be sent to the Girls&#8217; Home.</p>

<p>So God again proved His faithfulness to answer prayer, though it was just children who had told their wishes to Him. Hasn&#8217;t He said that the desires of the righteous shall be granted? Yes, even children can love and serve the Lord, and He will hear their prayers and answer them. If the answer is sometimes delayed, never stop believing.

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">Below is a recipe for the kind of bread that people in India eat with their rice and curry. It is like a flour tortilla and is fun to make.</p>
</div>


<h1>Chapatis</h1>

<p>Start an hour before serving&#8212;makes 10</p>

<p>Mix together:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>3 c. white flour</li>

<li>1 c. whole wheat flour</li>

<li>2 t. salt</li>

</ul>
<p>Cut in:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>1/2 c. shortening or butter</li>

</ul>
<p>Stir in:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>1 c. warm water</li>

</ul>
<p>Mix to make a ball. If the dough doesn&#8217;t stick together, add a tiny bit more water. Now knead the dough on a lightly floured counter for 3 minutes, adding just enough flour so it doesn&#8217;t stick.</p>

<p>Divide into 10 balls. Roll each ball into a thin circle (or square!) with a rolling pin.</p>

<p>Heat a cast iron or nonstick frying pan on medium-high heat. One at a time, cook the chapatis a minute or so on each side. Turn when they are speckled with brown. Wrap in a cloth and keep in a basket.</p>

<p>Serve warm with your meal.</p>

<h2>Something You Can Do</h2>
<p>Like we suggested in &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_5/Project/index.html">Gems for Your Treasure Chest</a>,
feeding and watching birds can be enjoyable and interesting. Here are some ideas for making your own &#8220;Feeding Station.&#8221; Just as when you read a recipe, you should read all the instructions before starting. You might even want to make one as a gift to bless someone else! Remind them that,
just as God cares for the birds, He cares for them, too (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+12%3A6-7">Luke 12:6-7</a>).
</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_5/feeder_station.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="121" /></div>
<h1>Make a Seed Feeder</h1>

<p>You will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>a 57&#8221; long, 1 x 6 board (or several shorter pieces)</li>

<li>two 12&#8221;-13&#8221; wood strips for railings</li>

<li>a pencil and ruler</li>

<li>a saw</li>

<li>hammer and nails</li>

<li>a piece of roofing tarpaper (or shingles)</li>

<li>an 8&#8217; post, or wire for hanging</li>

</ul>
<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_5/feeder_diagram.gif" alt="" width="300" height="150" /></div>
<p>From the 1 x 6 cut two 16&#8221; pieces, one 12&#8221; piece, and cut the remaining 13&#8221; piece as in this diagram:</p>

<p>Put the feeder together like the picture shows. First nail the two side pieces (the ones that have the slanted top edges) to the 12&#8221; base piece. Make sure that both the sides slant the same way.</p>

<p>Next nail the railing boards along the edge to keep the seed from falling out.</p>

<p>Use the two 16&#8221; pieces for the roof. First nail on top of the side boards, then cover with roofing tarpaper. This will help waterproof the feeder.</p>

<p>If you plan to mount the feeder on a post, attach the base of the feeder to it first, and then put the roof on. Or, if you want to hang it somewhere, put a couple nails in each end of the roof (not in the crack) to attatch wire to. Remember to put the feeder near a window where you can easily watch your feathered visitors.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_5/feeder_bird.jpg" alt="" width="125" height="212" /></div>
<h2>Some Fun Additions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add a wire cage on one side to put your suet &#8220;cake&#8221; in. This can be make out of chicken wire (or hardware cloth), with staples to attach it.</li>

<li>Pound some small-headed nails along the edge to hang fruit chunks on. Some birds especially like pieces of orange or apple to peck at.</li>

<li>Divide the feeder tray into sections with some more small wood strips. Put different kinds of seed (millet mix, sunflower seeds, cracked corn, oats) in each part, and see what the birds like the best.</li>

</ul>

<h1>On Your Guard</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Young Soldier:</p>

<p>Put on the shield of Faith today. Hold it up when the enemy sends out his flaming arrows. Then you shall not be hurt, for it will protect you from all trouble.</p>

<p>This is the shield of Faith: trust in Me. I will take care of every problem and need you have. My promises are written in the Bible for you to read. Look to Me and just believe what I say. I will take care of you and never leave you.</p>

<p>Never listen when the enemy whispers bad thoughts. Hold up your shield, trusting Me and never doubting. No matter how you feel, just decide to put your faith in Me. The enemy will soon have to flee away.</p>

<h1>I Have Learned&#8230;&#8203;</h1>

<h2 class="subtitle">that God Can Take Care of Me</h2>
<p class="noindent">Dear Boys and Girls,</p>

<p>Do you know that the King is happy when we praise Him? He has done so much for us and takes care of all our needs, so let us do our part. In the Bible it says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Give thanks unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>&#8230;&#8203;make known his deeds among the people. Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Chronicles+16%3A8-9" title="I&nbsp;Chronicles 16:8-9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Chronicles 16:8-9)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Just stop and remember a little. What has the Lord done to show His care for you? Were you scared? Was there trouble? Did you lose something or need something? There are many, many ways that God takes care of us. He protects us from dangers; He shows us where we are wrong; He teaches us in the Bible how to live right. And how about your food, clothes, and warm bed? What about your family, house, and friends?</p>

<p>Would you like to share with other boys and girls what you have learned? Have you learned to trust God? This is the time to tell about how God has taken care of you. If it is hard for you to write, ask someone to help you. Remember, we would be in great trouble if we didn&#8217;t have such a good Heavenly Father to care for us. Tell what He&#8217;s done for you!</p>

<p>Send your praises to:</p>

<h1>Forgiving</h1>

<p>Timothy Kahl was a very good boy, except for one thing. He always obeyed his parents, he always told the truth, and did his jobs without having to be told twice. But, if you ever did anything mean to Timothy Kahl, then you&#8217;d better look out! He would never forget.</p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t forget that Caroline Grigsby had made fun of the hole in his coat in front of her friends. He didn&#8217;t forget that Hector Carmichael, the big, neighborhood bully, had tripped him when he was carrying a box of library books.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_5/forgiving_plane.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="174" /></div>
<p>And he didn&#8217;t forget that his little brother, Josh, had crashed his model airplane to the floor. It was his favorite plane, too, and it had smashed into about a hundred pieces that went flying everywhere. Timothy hollered so loudly at Josh that it made him cry. It was very unfair for Josh to cry, Timothy thought. <i>He</i> wasn&#8217;t the one who had a little brother who smashed <i>his</i> airplane. It was all so unfair. Little brothers should be kept in cages until they were bigger, Timothy thought.</p>

<p>Timothy kept the wrecked plane on his desk where he could see it everyday. Sometimes he would show it to Josh, to remind him. Josh would look sad and that would make Timothy feel glad. It was not a very good kind of gladness, but Timothy liked to do it.</p>

<p>One night Daddy read the story of David, the shepherd boy who loved God. Daddy told how David came to play music for King Saul to make him feel better. But the music did not help, and King Saul felt worse and worse, because his heart was not right with God. Finally, he picked up a spear, and threw it at David. King Saul wanted to kill David; there was hatred in his heart. But David escaped. King Saul chased David day and night.</p>

<p>Timothy&#8217;s eyes grew big. It was so unfair! David hadn&#8217;t done anything wrong.</p>

<p>But Daddy said that David prayed to be able to forgive King Saul. And the Lord helped him. David and his friends were hiding in a cave when King Saul and his men came in. They did not see David or his friends. King Saul went to sleep in the cave, while his men watched outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your chance,&#8221; David&#8217;s friends said to him. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you kill him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said David. &#8220;I cannot touch him. I must forgive him and let God take care of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Timothy felt very strange. Suddenly, he knew what he must do. He ran and got the wrecked airplane, and dropped it in the wastebasket. Then he went to Josh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Josh, I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t forgive you&#8212;&#8221; he began. But deep inside of him, something broke in his heart and he began to cry. Inside of him, his heart began to pray to God. &#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry I didn&#8217;t forgive,&#8221; he prayed. He remembered his hard feelings against Hector and Caroline. At each remembrance, he begged God to forgive him. He forgot about the wrongs others had done to him, because he remembered how wrong he was. And then Timothy realized that Jesus wanted to forgive him, wanted to change him and make him different. Oh, how he wanted it! And he believed that Jesus could and would. Then something amazing happened inside, and he felt so happy. He hugged Josh. He hugged Mother and Daddy and everybody else in the family.</p>

<p>The new Timothy now forgave others when they did wrong to him.</p>

<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Princess,</p>

<p>Greetings of love from the King&#8217;s castle! You have been learning about many wonderful jewels in the King&#8217;s Court. Are you ready for a new one? This jewel is one that King Jesus Himself wears. It is the Gem of Humility, or sometimes called
<span class="scripture">&#8220;the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A4" title="I&nbsp;Peter 3:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 3:4)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>We have learned about the Veil of Quietness, and the Gem of Humility is a good jewel to add to it. Sometimes Dragon Envy, or Imp Self-Pity, or Imp Pout, or Bitterness darts, or Pride poison may slip underneath your Veil and take away the lovely Quietness. For this reason, King Jesus made the Gem of Humility for us to wear. It chases away all those terrible imps and enemy dragons.</p>

<p>Princess Precious, who lives at the King&#8217;s Court, has learned how important this Gem of Humility is. She was learning to read out of the Holy Book of the King&#8217;s Love Letters, and to remember many of them by heart. Other princesses could remember them too, but Princess Precious really thought that she could do it better than anyone else. Princess Precious did not realize it, but an imp was giving her Pride poison. She kind of liked these poison-thoughts and pride snuggled in easily under her Veil of Quietness.</p>

<p>One day Matron Mother asked the princesses to say their Love Letters. All the princesses came together with their Golden Obedience Gowns, and with their Love Letters in hand. Princess Precious thought, &#8220;She will really like mine, for I say it better than any of the others.&#8221; But Matron Mother didn&#8217;t say anything. When another Princess said a part of the Love Letters, she had a harder time saying it, and Matron Mother smiled at her.</p>

<p>Princess Precious frowned. &#8220;I said mine a whole lot better, and she didn&#8217;t even look at me!&#8221; she said to herself. Imp Self-Pity saw his chance and threw a whole bunch of bitterness darts at Princess Precious. They hit the pride hidden under her Veil of Quietness. She began to feel very sorry for herself, and tears stung her eyes. Now the darts from the imps really began to fly.</p>

<p>Then a soft messenger whispered, &#8220;Princess, go to the King!&#8221; Even though she felt so miserable, Princess Precious decided to flee up to King Jesus&#8217; throne. She was a sad mess, for the darts had torn her Veil; several jewels had been knocked off, and her Crown of Love had slipped halfway off her head. King Jesus looked at her, and Princess Precious really felt ashamed. Small and miserable, she knelt before His throne, but when King Jesus spoke all the imps had to flee.</p>

<p>King Jesus cleaned her up and gave her a new Veil of Quietness, and also something else. What do you think it was? He gave her the Gem of Humility, and said that if she always would wear it, she would never be troubled by Pride poison again. The Gem of Humility helps the Princess to see how little she really is, how she cannot do things better than anyone else. It helps her to know that she is not a great big princess, but reminds her that she is truly just a little princess, who serves a great big King.</p>

<p class="signature">With much Love sent to every Princess,<br />Aunt Grace</p>

<p>P.S. Imps are the Enemy&#8217;s little workers who are very mean little liars.</p>
