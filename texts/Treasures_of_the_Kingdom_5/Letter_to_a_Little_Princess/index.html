<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Princess,</p>

<p>Greetings of love from the King&#8217;s castle! You have been learning about many wonderful jewels in the King&#8217;s Court. Are you ready for a new one? This jewel is one that King Jesus Himself wears. It is the Gem of Humility, or sometimes called
<span class="scripture">&#8220;the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A4" title="I&nbsp;Peter 3:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 3:4)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>We have learned about the Veil of Quietness, and the Gem of Humility is a good jewel to add to it. Sometimes Dragon Envy, or Imp Self-Pity, or Imp Pout, or Bitterness darts, or Pride poison may slip underneath your Veil and take away the lovely Quietness. For this reason, King Jesus made the Gem of Humility for us to wear. It chases away all those terrible imps and enemy dragons.</p>

<p>Princess Precious, who lives at the King&#8217;s Court, has learned how important this Gem of Humility is. She was learning to read out of the Holy Book of the King&#8217;s Love Letters, and to remember many of them by heart. Other princesses could remember them too, but Princess Precious really thought that she could do it better than anyone else. Princess Precious did not realize it, but an imp was giving her Pride poison. She kind of liked these poison-thoughts and pride snuggled in easily under her Veil of Quietness.</p>

<p>One day Matron Mother asked the princesses to say their Love Letters. All the princesses came together with their Golden Obedience Gowns, and with their Love Letters in hand. Princess Precious thought, &#8220;She will really like mine, for I say it better than any of the others.&#8221; But Matron Mother didn&#8217;t say anything. When another Princess said a part of the Love Letters, she had a harder time saying it, and Matron Mother smiled at her.</p>

<p>Princess Precious frowned. &#8220;I said mine a whole lot better, and she didn&#8217;t even look at me!&#8221; she said to herself. Imp Self-Pity saw his chance and threw a whole bunch of bitterness darts at Princess Precious. They hit the pride hidden under her Veil of Quietness. She began to feel very sorry for herself, and tears stung her eyes. Now the darts from the imps really began to fly.</p>

<p>Then a soft messenger whispered, &#8220;Princess, go to the King!&#8221; Even though she felt so miserable, Princess Precious decided to flee up to King Jesus&#8217; throne. She was a sad mess, for the darts had torn her Veil; several jewels had been knocked off, and her Crown of Love had slipped halfway off her head. King Jesus looked at her, and Princess Precious really felt ashamed. Small and miserable, she knelt before His throne, but when King Jesus spoke all the imps had to flee.</p>

<p>King Jesus cleaned her up and gave her a new Veil of Quietness, and also something else. What do you think it was? He gave her the Gem of Humility, and said that if she always would wear it, she would never be troubled by Pride poison again. The Gem of Humility helps the Princess to see how little she really is, how she cannot do things better than anyone else. It helps her to know that she is not a great big princess, but reminds her that she is truly just a little princess, who serves a great big King.</p>

<p class="signature">With much Love sent to every Princess,<br />Aunt Grace</p>

<p>P.S. Imps are the Enemy&#8217;s little workers who are very mean little liars.</p>
