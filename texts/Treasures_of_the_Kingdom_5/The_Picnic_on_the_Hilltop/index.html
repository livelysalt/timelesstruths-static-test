<p>&#8220;Time for a story!&#8221; Edward shouted, racing his brother and sister to Grandpa&#8217;s chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait for me,&#8221; little Sammy said, puffing up behind, &#8220;I want to hear, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one shall be left out,&#8221; said Grandpa, &#8220;each person has a place to help. Today I think I shall tell a story about a boy that helped Jesus. It is called:</p>

<h1>The Picnic on the Hilltop</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+6%3A1-13">John 6:1-13</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Long ago, during the time that Jesus walked the shores of Galilee, there lived a boy whom I will call Jared. Jared lived with his father and mother and two little sisters and baby brother in Capernaum. One day they heard that Jesus was teaching in the hills, so they decided to take a picnic lunch and go listen. So on a bright sunny morning they set out. Jared carried the picnic basket and was glad when they finally reached the crowded hilltop, for the basket was getting quite heavy. They picked a place that wasn&#8217;t so crowded, but close enough to hear Jesus, and sat down.</p>

<p>All morning Jesus taught the people, and many sick people came and were healed. Jared was fascinated* with the stories Jesus taught about the Kingdom of Heaven. He forgot all about their lunch until his sisters began to cry for something to eat. Then he noticed that it was getting late, for the sun was going down. Jared looked around and saw that few people had brought anything to eat. Opening the picnic basket, he looked at the two fried fish and five barley rolls his mother had packed for their lunch. His mouth watered; how good they would taste!</p>

<p>&#8220;Young lad,&#8221; said a man, bending near, &#8220;do you have some bread to share?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jared, a bit startled, noticed that it was one of Jesus&#8217; disciples. He looked again at the picnic lunch: there was hardly enough for themselves, and he was very hungry. But when he looked up the hillside at Jesus&#8217; kind face, Jared remembered how good He had been to them, healing the sick and telling stories.</p>

<p>Picking up the basket he handed it over to the man. &#8220;Here, give it to Jesus,&#8221; Jared said. The man took it, and Jared sat with no lunch at all. But he saw Jesus smile as He took the basket. To Jared&#8217;s surprise, He told the people to sit down in groups. When everyone was quiet, Jesus lifted the basket and asked a blessing for the food. What was Jesus planning to do?</p>

<p>Wide-eyed, Jared watched as Jesus began passing rolls to His disciples. Four, five, six&#8230;&#8203;and still there was more! Back and forth through the hungry crowds the food was passed. Soon Jared and his family were munching on fried fish and good, fresh barley rolls with everyone else. Why, this was the best food he&#8217;d ever tasted! Jared thought about their little lunch and was so glad he had given it to Jesus. When Jesus had prayed, there was enough for everyone!</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Sammy smiled as Grandpa finished the story. &#8220;Jesus can do anything!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but what did Jared have to do first?&#8221; Grandpa asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He gave his lunch,&#8221; said Edward.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s sort of like giving up our own way, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Alice said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Grandpa, &#8220;Jesus wants each of us to give what we have to Him: your toys to share, your hands to serve Him, your smile to cheer someone else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then Jesus can make something big out of it,&#8221; said Edward.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just like multiplication,&#8221; Alice said, &#8220;Jesus <i>multiplied</i> the lunch Jared gave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He surely did,&#8221; Grandpa agreed. &#8220;And He can multiply your little &#8216;lunches,&#8217; too. When you give them to Jesus, He can use it to bless everyone else!&#8221;</p>
