<h1>Sins Named</h1>

<p>My grandson, let us look at the Bible and see some sins that are mentioned.</p>

<p>In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+5%3A19">Galatians 5:19</a> we read that adultery is a sin. In the 21st verse it is clearly stated that <span class="scripture">&#8220;they that do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+5%3A21" title="Galatians 5:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 5:21)</span></a></span> So there is no doubt about these sins. <i>Adultery</i> means, &#8220;violation of the marriage-bed.&#8221; <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+7%3A2-3">Romans 7:2-3</a> says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband as long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.&#8221;</span> We know that when a couple marries, it is for life or until one of them dies. Read <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+19%3A7-8">Matthew 19:7-8</a>, where Jesus reaffirms this truth.</p>

<p><i>Fornication</i> is the &#8220;illicit sexual intercourse of unmarried persons,&#8221; which is also adultery. This is a sin. Many today are just living together. This is a sin and a stench in the nostrils of God. It is terrible and so immoral, even if many today are doing it.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But fornication, . . . let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Eph.+5%3A3" title="Eph. 5:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Eph. 5:3)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Flee fornication&#8230;. What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God&#8217;s.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+6%3A18-20" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 6:18-20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 6:18-20)</span></a></span> You see our bodies are to be kept pure and clean. That means our minds are to be clean and pure also. Sometimes the devil will bring evil thoughts to our minds but we must not think upon them. Think pure thoughts.</p>

<p>God created our bodies and every part is for a purpose. We want to keep our bodies free from impurities. There are urges in our body, and sometimes a drawing to the opposite sex, hut we must not let that urge have control. We must keep our bodies under control. The Apostle Paul tells us what he did. He said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+9%3A27" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 9:27"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 9:27)</span></a></span>
Jesus also tells us <span class="scripture">&#8220;that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+5%3A28" title="Matthew 5:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 5:28)</span></a></span>
We need to be very careful of our thoughts, and where our eyes wander. Keep the right kind of thoughts. A mother told her son when he was taking a trip, &#8220;Son, never do anything to place your body where your soul would not be the master.&#8221; Petting and kissing among young people will lead to wrong thoughts and lead them into traps. We need to be careful and watchful about all of these things. &#8220;Keep thyself pure.&#8221; My dear grandson, we are in a battle in this world against all evil. The devil wants to destroy our souls and cause us to miss eternal life with Jesus Christ, the Lover of our souls. The devil has many agents in the world who also help him. In the schools today your teachers are taught how to change your thinking. They will slowly but surely work on you day by day to do so. Beware of this. Don&#8217;t let anyone destroy your faith in God, in the Bible, nor in what it teaches as being the Eternal Word of God. Guard this faith and live by it. It means your eternal destiny. Whether anyone says God&#8217;s Word is true or false, it will still be true. Men&#8217;s thoughts and ideas will never change God&#8217;s Word.</p>

<p>The next sin is uncleanness. The dictionary says that <i>uncleanness</i> means &#8220;morally impure, foul, filthy, unchaste and obscene.&#8221; The Bible says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+4%3A7" title="I&nbsp;Thessalonians 4:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Thessalonians 4:7)</span></a></span> This means that we are to keep ourselves pure in thought, word, and deed. Keep a rebuke in your heart against dirty jokes and those things that lead to impurity. The Bible says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+1%3A15" title="Titus 1:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Titus 1:15)</span></a></span>
Homosexuality would come under this sin. The Bible plainly condemns this sin. In Romans we read about the corrupt man and it says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves&#8230;. For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet [fit]. And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; being filled with all unrighteousness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+1%3A24-28" title="Romans 1:24-28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 1:24-28)</span></a></span>
It is very plain that homosexuality is a terrible sin. God has a purpose for the use of each member of our bodies and it is not to be used in sinful ways. Sex is for a purpose and that is to bring children into the world and for the purpose of love-making between married couples. But it is not to be abused and temperance is to be used. Temperance is one of the fruits of the Spirit (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+5%3A23">Galatians 5:23</a>). Each member is to be used for the purpose that God has intended. Remember this and the Lord will give you understanding.</p>

<p><i>Lasciviousness</i> means &#8220;lustful, wanton, loose; a person who excites lustful emotions in others.&#8221; Let us study this with careful thought. The world today advertises the fact that this or that will give &#8220;sexual appeal.&#8221; This is lasciviousness. Wearing clothing that does this is sin. Acting in a way to cause others to have lustful emotions is a sin. That is, if a person purposely acts in this way, or dresses in this way. Speaking words and making signs that does this are sins. Oh, God is calling for a pure and holy people! His church, which is made up of holy (sinless) people, is without spot and blemish and has been cleansed and made pure through the blood of Jesus Christ (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A27">Ephesians 5:27</a>). We must he pure to be in it.</p>

<p>The next sin mentioned is <i>idolatry</i>, which means &#8220;divine honors paid to idols, images, or any created object&#8221; (<i>Webster&#8217;s Dictionary</i>). It also says it means &#8220;excessive admiration, or love, for any person or thing.&#8221; To worship any image or man-made god is sin. There in only one true God and we must worship Him in spirit and in truth. Also we do not want to have an &#8220;excessive love&#8221; for any person or thing more than our love for God. Some people allow things to keep them from having a true love for God. This is a sin. If you let money, possessions, or any person keep you from serving the Lord with all of your heart, then you have an idol. The Apostle John said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Little children, keep yourselves from idols.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+5%3A21" title="I&nbsp;John 5:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 5:21)</span></a></span>
We are to <span class="scripture">&#8220;Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+22%3A37" title="Matthew 22:37"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 22:37)</span></a></span>
Surely that means a lot, doesn&#8217;t it? There can&#8217;t be one thing or person between us and God. He must absolutely be first in our life.</p>

<p>Oh, my grandson, it truly is a wonderful thing to put God first! He is so precious to my soul and I know He will be to yours as you love and serve Him with all of your heart! Jesus has said,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+6%3A33" title="Matthew 6:33"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 6:33)</span></a></span>
What God adds is just perfect even though at the time we might not understand it.</p>

<p>The next sin is witchcraft. Today many people are turning to magical powers and are having communion with evil spirits and the devil. This is what witchcraft is. Fortune tellers, spiritualist readers, etc., are all of the devil and should never he considered nor tampered with. Many have, in fun, or wanting to know something, imbibed an evil spirit and were tormented by it day and night. God will protect His people if they will look to Him and not yield to evil spirits. It is dangerous. Read <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Leviticus+19%3A31%3B+Deuteronomy+18%3A10-12%3B+Acts+16%3A16-19%3B+8%3A11-21%3B+13%3A6-12">Leviticus 19:31; Deuteronomy 18:10-12; Acts 16:16-19; 8:11-21; 13:6-12</a>.</p>

<p>Hatred is a sin. Even if someone does us a wrong we must forgive them or Jesus will not forgive us (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+6%3A14%2C15">Matthew 6:14,15</a>). Ill-feeling toward someone is a cousin to hatred. We need to forgive and ask God to help us to love everyone regardless of what they do to us. Wrath is also a sin and many times is connected with hatred. We must not give vent to our anger but bring it under control. God has help for everyone who will pray to Him and seek after Him.</p>

<p><i>Variance</i> means &#8220;a verbal strife followed by strained or severed relations: wrangle or squabble: to dispute angrily.&#8221; This is connected to hatred and wrath.</p>

<p><i>Emulations</i> means &#8220;to strive to equal or excel with a view to outdo; ambitious or envious rivalry.&#8221; In other words stepping on someone else to get ahead of them or others. Oh, the Lord wants us to be considerate of others!</p>

<p>Strife and envyings come under this same thing. We must love every soul and not try to disregard their feelings or desires. Be happy for others to get ahead, and <span class="scripture">&#8220;Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+12%3A15" title="Romans 12:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 12:15)</span></a></span> is what the Bible tells us to do.</p>

<p>Murderers are those who willfully kill, and are sinners. They must seek forgiveness to be ready for heaven. If a person accidentally kills, that is not a sin, but it is a tragedy. It is the person who purposely kills who is a murderer and a sinner. To take one&#8217;s own life is a sin, that is, if the person is in his right mind. We know that some people&#8217;s minds are afflicted (or wear out), and they are not responsible, yet there are some close lines even in these cases.</p>

<p>Drunkenness is a sin. <i>Drunkenness</i> is the &#8220;state of being drunk with strong drink or alcoholic liquor so that the use of the faculties is materially impaired&#8221; (<i>Webster&#8217;s Dictionary</i>). Oh, the sorrow and trouble that drunkenness has brought to little children, homes, wives and husbands, mothers and fathers, sisters, brothers and nations! It is a terrible thing! Today there is so much dope being taken. It is a terrible thing to abuse one&#8217;s body. God will not hold a person guiltless who abuses his body in any manner (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+23%3A29-32">Proverbs 23:29-32</a>). God has deliverance for all who get into this sin if they will only seek after God. But my dear grandson, flee from all of it. &#8220;Touch not the cup.&#8221; Never even taste it and you will never be a drunkard. Some say they can take it or leave it, but many did that for awhile, and today they are on &#8220;skid row.&#8221; They lost their health, their wealth, their children, and their companions. Their life is wretched. Some might say, &#8220;It would not happen to me,&#8221; but they must flee from it as they would a serpent that is ready to strike.</p>

<p>Smoking cigarettes and taking anything that harms the body is a sin. The Bible says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy: for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+3%3A17" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 3:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 3:17)</span></a></span>
What could be plainer? My dear grandson, I am expecting you to flee from all of these sins which are against the body which will destroy your body and soul in eternal torment for all eternity. Remember that eternity never ends. There is no time in eternity. Death seals your doom. It will pay to live each day in a way that we will be ready to meet God, or will be ready in that hour of death. It might come unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Seditions and heresies are sins. False teachings which are contrary to the Bible teachings are heresies. They are sin. We want to live according to the Bible and know its doctrines so we can not be led into heresies. So many are being deceived by false teachers. People today believe everything they hear and do not search the Bible to see if it is true. We must not believe teaching from false teachers. Some will say, &#8220;But that person has studied the Bible many years and he ought to know.&#8221; He may have a degree in theology, etc., but that doesn&#8217;t make any difference. We still must stay upon a firm foundation and find it in the Word for ourselves. There is a chain running through the Bible that links truth and it must not be broken, or it will not be truth. We are instructed in the Bible to
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A15-16" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 2:15-16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 2:15-16)</span></a></span></p>

<p>The next sins that are given are revelings and such like. <i>Reveling</i> means &#8220;a noisy or riotous feast; or to feast with joyous or clamorous merriment, boisterous festivity.&#8221; In other words it means a loud, boisterous manner of acting, or being in a crowd that acts that way. In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A4">I&nbsp;Peter 3:4</a> it says for us to have <span class="scripture">&#8220;a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.&#8221;</span> This is in harmony with God&#8217;s Spirit and His Word.</p>

<p>I do trust that you have an idea of what God is expecting of us. In other words, we have listed what the Bible teaches about some things that are wrong, and what is right. As you said, the Bible is a big book and we can&#8217;t find everything, unless we are familiar with it, so I trust these few things have been a help, as you study them. Remember that we need to have Jesus to help us daily to obey the Word of God and be ready to meet the Lord. It takes being saved from our sins, being filled with the Holy Spirit, and praying and studying God&#8217;s Word. It is a precious life when we are in the center of God&#8217;s will. When we are saved, we can have the fruits of the Spirit in our life which are named in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+5%3A22-23">Galatians 5:22-23</a>. They are love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance, and many other good things that God will give to us as we live and serve Him.</p>

<p><a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+1%3A29-32">Romans 1:29-32</a> mentions more sins. It says that those who turn themselves over to the devil to work his evil ways are <span class="scripture">&#8220;filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness, full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity, whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.&#8221;</span> What a terrible list of sins! Oh, we must flee from any of them. If you get your dictionary and look up the meaning of each one of these you would see how sinful sin is. No wonder God looks down upon sinful mankind and is grieved. Now mercy is held out to all who will turn to Him and through Jesus Christ seek forgiveness and turn away from sin, but the time is coming when mercy will be withdrawn. This old world will be on fire and only the holy and true will be taken to that prepared place for a prepared people who have sought God. Oh, I surely want to be ready in that day and hour, don&#8217;t you?</p>
