<h1>Jesus Destroys the Works of the Devil</h1>

<p>When we realize that we have sinned and know that sin will keep us away from living in eternity in the presence of God, we are filled with sorrow. First, we do not want to be <span class="scripture">&#8220;cast into the lake of fire,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+20%3A15" title="Revelation 20:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 20:15)</span></a></span> nor be with the devil and his angels as Jesus has warned. He spoke of those being
<span class="scripture">&#8220;cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+9%3A44" title="Mark 9:44"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 9:44)</span></a></span></p>

<p>The next thing we think of is how Jesus loved us so much, He came willingly to take the punishment for our sins. Sin had to be punished. Man could not redeem us from our sins as all men had sinned. Jesus was innocent and without sin. He was with God from the beginning but He was born of woman, and took upon Himself flesh and blood. He lived here in this world, was mistreated and finally put on the cross to die a horrible death, although He was innocent. Why? Because He loved you and me.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;God sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+4%3A9" title="I&nbsp;John 4:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 4:9)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;He that committeth sin is of the devil, for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil. Whosoever is born of God doth not committ sin, because he is born of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+3%3A8-9" title="I&nbsp;John 3:8-9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 3:8-9)</span></a></span> Through Jesus&#8217; death on the cross, sin can be forgiven, and we can come into the presence of God.</p>

<p>When we realize that we have sinned and are sorry for that sin, we come to Jesus, and with <span class="scripture">&#8220;godly sorrow&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+7%3A10" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 7:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 7:10)</span></a></span> ask Him to forgive us. Jesus hears our prayer and forgives us of our sins. By believing that He took our punishment for our sins, in dying on the cross, we are forgiven by God, and all is clear between us and God. Our sins are under the blood of Jesus. In olden times, in the Old Testament, they offered a lamb, but after Jesus came, He was the Lamb who was sacrificed on the cross once and forever for sins. John the Baptist said, when he saw Jesus,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+1%3A29" title="John 1:29"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 1:29)</span></a></span>
He will take away our sins, when we confess them to Him, and in prayer, believe that He takes them away. I surely can&#8217;t forget when the Lord did just that for me. It was wonderful to know that all was clear between God and me. I could sleep better, and it was wonderful to know that if death overtook me I would be ready to go.</p>

<p>When I realized that I needed to be sanctified&#8212;or to be freed from the sin principle, which needed to be cleansed out of my heart&#8212;I sought the Lord to give me the Holy Spirit. You can&#8217;t ask forgiveness for the sin that passed down upon all men from the fall, or the sin of Adam and Eve. It has to be cleansed out of your heart by the purging of the Holy Spirit. There are two works in the heart. First we are saved from our volitional sins and then we are sanctified, or cleansed, of that sin principle or carnal nature. Peter speaks of some receiving the Holy Spirit, and said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;purifying their hearts by faith.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+15%3A9" title="Acts 15:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 15:9)</span></a></span> God had
<span class="scripture">&#8220;[given] them the Holy Ghost.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+15%3A8" title="Acts 15:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 15:8)</span></a></span>
Then we can have power over all the power of the devil. The works of the devil are destroyed out of our hearts. Praise God forever! It is a wonderful experience.</p>

<p>Oh, how we love our Lord and Savior for all that He has done for us! How sad we would be if He had not come to this world to take our punishment. How thankful we are for the Holy Spirit that was promised to us after Jesus went away. He told His disciples that the Holy Spirit, or the Comforter, could not come unless He went to the Father (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+14">John 14</a>).</p>

<p>We read how God gave the disciples the Holy Spirit, after Jesus arose into the skies, after His resurrection from the grave. In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=the+second+chapter+of+Acts">the second chapter of Acts</a>, they were waiting in the upper room, and the Holy Spirit came upon them and God performed a miracle. They spoke the wonderful news and different nations heard about it in their own language. It was on the day of Pentecost when people from all of these nations had come to the temple to worship God. Many of them believed on Jesus as the promised Savior, were saved from their sins, and were filled with the Holy Spirit. It&#8217;s a glorious experience and is for everyone who has been saved from sin.</p>
