<h1>The Temperance Society</h1>

<p>The mid-week cottage prayer meeting was well attended by the members of his faith, the Wednesday evening following the vote to withdraw fellowship from Joe and his wife, for the news had spread in this local community, and there were many curiosity seekers at the meeting desirous to find out just what Joe would do. He had been called upon also by several of his neighbors and friends, and the subject had been discussed both pro and con among the neighbors. All were curious to know just what Joe would have to say about it at the meeting; so all were there.</p>

<p>Although Joe was hurt to the heart&#8217;s core, with the hurt came a feeling of pity for his persecutors, and he refrained from speaking about the subject to the neighbors who called, for he felt that those who had dealt with him were in the same condition that he was in prior to his conversion, and had it not been for the overpersuasion of Preacher Brumbaugh, he felt that they would not have voted to excommunicate him. So he talked little but prayed much before the prayer meeting.</p>

<p>As the neighbors came together, instead of finding a man who was wearing a cast-down expression, they looked upon the face of a man with a sparkling countenance. For Joe had risen above the trial and was rejoicing in the victory. He had opened his Bible and read,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Commit thy way unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+37%3A5" title="Psalm 37:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 37:5)</span></a></span>
and he had committed it all to God, and was now just trusting Him to bring it to pass in the way that would please Him and be glorifying to His name. Joe&#8217;s confidence in God inspired faith in Susie also, and she stood by his side, promising to go through with him, come what may.</p>

<p>The clear soprano of Susie, and the rich, deep bass of Joe was heard in every song, and their prayers were heard among the others. To the surprise of some they asked God to bless those who were persecuting them, and in some way open the way, that the light which now shone within their own souls could reach them. Their testimony was one of praise to God and of confidence in Him. During the entire evening, nothing was said about the church trial the Sunday evening before. As those present looked upon Joe, they concluded that he did not care what had been done to him, but none knew what a battle had been fought and what a victory had been won. Joe stood before that crowd that Wednesday evening as a conqueror, for such he was. He was asking God to direct him to a people among whom he could worship, for he knew it would be impossible to try to worship among those people again. How confident he felt in the Lord as he stood before these people on this particular night!</p>

<p>Among those present at the prayer meeting was a stranger whom no one knew. He came alone and did not arrive until prayer meeting had begun, but as the services drew near to a close, he made his way to the center of the room and began to tell why he was there. He had come to Newton, a small town near Steele&#8217;s Crossing, as a representative of the Anti-Saloon League, and while there learned that there was a saloon at Steele&#8217;s Crossing, although it was only a crossroad in the country, with a store, a blacksmith shop, a shoe-shop, a schoolhouse, a community house, post office, doctor&#8217;s office, and five dwellings. The storekeeper had charge of the post office, and the doctor&#8217;s office comprised two rooms of his house. The main business houses of the little crossroads town were the store, the blacksmith shop, and the shoe-shop, which was a little room adjoining the saloon. About half a mile from the Crossing was the little chapel where Joe and Susie had been worshiping since coming into the community.</p>

<p>The saloon had been there for a number of years, and although many had spoken of it as a menace, none knew there could be steps taken to rid the country of it. The stranger of the evening told his hearers how he had heard of the prayer meeting, and thought it a good time to meet with them and arrange some plans for the closing of the saloon doors. He told them he would meet with them the following Sunday evening in the community house at Steele&#8217;s Crossing and organize a Temperance Society, stating further that he had organized one at Newton and would send them speakers from time to time and furnish information as needed to rid the community of the saloon. All hands were raised as he called for an expression from those present to meet with him the following Sunday evening.</p>

<p>They met. The news had spread all over the country, and the community house was full to overflowing. Every seat was taken; the aisles were full, and the windows and door crowded with listeners. The doctor was there, a prominent figure among them, and the saloon-keeper&#8217;s wife and eldest daughter occupied one of the front seats. The visitor at the prayer meeting, who was Mr. Neal, asked for a song and opened the services. At the close of the song he pointed to Joe and, not knowing his name, he said, &#8220;We will ask this brother to lead us in prayer.&#8221; Some knelt, some bowed their heads, and others stood up. Joe knelt and prayed as he would have prayed had he been alone with his God. After prayer Mr. Neal began to address the people of Steele&#8217;s Crossing. Some had come thinking they would hear him bemean the saloon-keeper, but such was not so, for he only set forth the evils of intoxicants and the menace of the open saloon in the community, the danger of it for the youth. All listened attentively, and when he informed them as to ways to rid the country of this menace to their youth, many were eager to get into the fight. He informed them that, since meeting with them on the previous Wednesday evening, he had made some investigation and found that the license for the saloon would soon expire, and if they would only organize and follow the petition for the saloon with a remonstrance against it, they could prevail on the court and no license would be granted. When he called for members, the doctor&#8217;s name was enrolled first of all, followed by a number of others, among them Joe and Alfred.</p>

<p>While some were enrolling Joe stepped over to Alfred and said, &#8220;Why could we not hold services here every Sunday night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be a very good idea,&#8221; replied Alfred, as a smile spread over his face. &#8220;I shall speak to the wrowd about it before we dismiss.&#8221; This he did, announcing services for the following Sunday evening.</p>

<p>Mr. Neal took his departure, but something else had started in that temperance meeting that would stir the entire community for miles around. At the first Sunday evening service the suggestion was made that they abandon the cottage prayer meetings and congregate in the community house instead. This they did, and soon not only were they having prayer meetings and Sunday evening services, but a Sunday School was organized, with Joe as superintendent. As Alfred was given the responsibility of finding someone to preach to them on Sunday evenings he was kept busy. Often he was unable to find anyone, so he had to take charge of the services himself, and in this way he advanced rapidly, and he did not lack for hearers. Alfred and Tillie were good singers, and with some practice, Joe, Susie, Alfred and Tulle composed a quartet and rendered some special songs at each service. They were known as the &#8220;Steele&#8217;s Crossing Quartet.&#8221; They were kept busy, and so all were happy, and many calls came to them to sing at different meetings. Joe felt happy in his work, for he felt that he was doing something for God. Although he knew that he could not get such good thoughts to present to people as did Alfred, he felt confident within himself that he could sing the gospel as well as Alfred, for his rich, deep bass rang out clearly and he put his whole soul into his singing. He sang from the sentiment of his heart real praises to his God.</p>

<p>Although Joe&#8217;s name and that of his wife had been erased from the church ledger, they still attired themselves in the peculiar dress of that faith. Joe still wore the broadbrimmed, flat crown hat and Susie the black bonnet, with the little white cap. But at the community house there was no question asked as to any particular faith. It was a community prayer meeting, and cormmunity Sunday School, and all worked together, and God worked among them. The meetings were well attended, and the speakers who were sent to them by the Anti-Saloon League marveled at the number who attended the meetings at such an out-of-the-way place.</p>

<p>If Joe had been considered a model before his conversion, he was looked upon as a marvel now, for he looked for the opportunity to return good for evil, and many a favor was granted by him to those who had been his persecutors. In this way he won them to himself, and Preacher Brumbaugh saw his congregation diminish one by one as his followers attended services at the community house. Old Brother Metzgar and Aunt Sally Pobst were Joe&#8217;s strong supporters, and Joe&#8217;s kindnesses to his neighbors brought many of them to the services. Joe said little, but prayed much. In this way he became powerful in prayer. He had his secret place of prayer in a room of his granary.</p>

<p>One day one of his neighbors came to see him and inquired of Susie his whereabouts, to which she replied, &#8220;He has just gone to the barn, and I am sure that you will find him out there somewhere.&#8221; The neighbor found Joe there, but he was in the granary, and the neighbor listened, while Joe asked God to bless his neighbors and their children and then asked for grace for himself and his family. The neighbor stood for half an hour waiting for Joe, and when he left he remarked to another neighbor, &#8220;That Joe Holmier is the prayingest man I have ever seen.&#8221;</p>
