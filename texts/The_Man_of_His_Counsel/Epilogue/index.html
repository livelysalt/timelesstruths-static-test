<h1>Epilogue</h1>

<p>Twenty years have passed since Joe Holmier settled in the Steele&#8217;s Crossing neighborhood and many changes have come. The old saloon building which was used by Preacher Brown and his followers as a place in which to worship no longer stands at the crossing, for when he left the community his followers soon disbanded, and the building was sold to a farmer in the community. The farmer used it for a few years as a storage room for his baled hay and to house some of his farming implements. Later he tore it down and erected a large hay barn in its place.</p>

<p>The postoffice is no longer connected with the store, as daily the deliveryman from Newton passes by to deposit mail in the numerous boxes along the route. The old schoolhouse has been torn away and a new brick building erected in its place. The community house is no longer standing, but on its site is a good church building bearing the engraving on a stone slab over the door, &#8220;CHURCH OF GOD, THE PILLAR AND GROUND OF THE TRUTH.&#8221; As one enters through the doorway, the following words greet the eye, which are to the right of the platform,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+100%3A4" title="Psalm 100:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 100:4)</span></a></span>
Directly back of the platform are the words.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Holiness becometh thine house, O L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, for ever.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+93%3A5" title="Psalm 93:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 93:5)</span></a></span>
To the left one can read,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+133%3A1" title="Psalm 133:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 133:1)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>In this building the people of Steele&#8217;s Crossing community congregate each Lord&#8217;s day and the walls of the building resound with the praises of God as these humble people sing unto Him from hearts made free from sin. Here they worship as one, held together by the bonds of the Holy Spirit. Alfred and his good wife TiIlie no longer live near Joe and Susie, as Alfred has been pastoring a congregation in one of the Western States for some years. Bill Myers and his companion have both been called to their eternal reward. Preacher Brumbaugh and Mr. Sawyer have both passed away. Aunt Sally Teeters still remains; but she must be led about as she is blind. No change has been made in her spiritual condition and she is still a fighter of holiness.</p>

<p>June came, and Joe and Alfred met again on the great campground of the annual international campmeeting. They praised the Lord together as they recalled incidents of former days. At last Alfred said, &#8220;Oh, I want to tell you something. Do you remember that Preacher Reed who held a meeting at the crossing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Joe. &#8220;He was the first man I ever heard mention anything about sanctification. But what about him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something good,&#8221; said Alfred. &#8220;I had him with me in a meeting a few weeks ago and he is here at this camp meeting. He, too, is doing all he can to get God&#8217;s people together and break down the barriers that are between them. He is a powerful preacher and a firm believer in unity. There he comes now.&#8221; At this he motioned to the man whom he had pointed out to be Evangelist Reed, who then joined the two men. After the usual greeting Joe said, &#8220;Alfred has been telling me you were with him in a meeting. You know I love this man because he showed me by his life that there is something more in the service of God than just to belong to some church.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Alfred put his hand on Joe&#8217;s shoulder, and said, &#8220;Yes, and I love this man, because he showed me the great church of God and that we are all one together in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is truly wonderful,&#8221; said Evangelist Reed; &#8220;truly wonderful, to be together in the one great body of Christ with no barriers between us. Oh, how I thank God for the bond of fellowship, through the Holy Spirit, that binds us together and makes us one in Christ Jesus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is wonderful,&#8221; replied Joe, &#8220;but the most wonderful thing to me is to know it is all so clearly set forth in the Word of God and all may be able to see it if they will only take his Word as <i>the man of their counsel</i> and walk in the light which it gives.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three turned and walked toward the auditorium as the great congregation began to sing:</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Back to the blessed old Bible,<br />Back to the city of God;<br />Back to the oneness of heaven,<br />Back where the faithful have trod.<br />Back from the land of confusion,<br />Passing the wrecks and the creeds;<br />Back to the light of the morning,<br />Jesus our Captain leads.&#8221;</p>

<p>They reached the auditorium, and, stepping inside the door, joined in the chorus with the light of glory on their faces:</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Back to the blessed old Bible,<br />Back to the light of its word;<br />Be on our banners forever:<br />&#8216;Holiness unto the Lord.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Back_to_the_Blessed_Old_Bible/index.html" title="Back to the Blessed Old Bible">*</a></p>
