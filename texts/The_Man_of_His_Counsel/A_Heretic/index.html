<h1>A Heretic</h1>

<p>One would conclude, after the meeting of the morning with the official board, that Joe would not want to return and try to worship with such a people, but that was not the case, for on the evening of the same day he again went to the little chapel for the evening&#8217;s service. But as Joe passed Preacher Brumbaugh at the door, there was no hearty response to his &#8220;good evening,&#8221; and no hand shake. As Joe reached out his hand Preacher Brumbaugh was for some reason attracted by something on the other side of the room, and so turned and walked away. A feeling of sadness seized Joe as he sat down beside some of the brethren, for there was no one to extend a hand to him.</p>

<p>As Joe looked over the audience he could see knowing glances exchanged, and as others came in and would look his way he could also see nudging of elbows. How lonely he felt and how much he desired to be near Susie, but, as it was the custom among his particular faith for the men to occupy one side of the house and the women the other when they came together for worship, it would be unseemly for him to try to get near her now. Joe&#8217;s voice had always been heard during song service, and his rich, deep bass was an asset to the singing, but this evening Joe&#8217;s voice was not heard. There was no freedom for him. As they knelt for prayer, tears flowed freely down his cheeks, for here he was among his neighbors, and some of them refusing to look his way or give him a friendly handshake. While kneeling there among those whom he felt were trying to do him harm, Joe again lifted his heart to the Lord and felt an assurance that God had heard and all would be well.</p>

<p>Another song after prayer and Preacher Brumbaugh arose to deliver the sermon for the evening, taking for his text the eighth verse of the first chapter of Galatians, reading it the third time, and each time laying more stress upon it.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+1%3A8" title="Galatians 1:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 1:8)</span></a></span>
It did not take Joe long to grasp what the trend of the preacher&#8217;s thoughts for the evening&#8217;s discourse was. He had heretofore been very quiet in his mode of delivery, but now he began to tell the congregation of the danger that was before them and he began to wax bold. Becoming heated with the thought of one coming among them teaching other than the doctrine which he had preached, he made no choice of words and some were shocked at the language he used. At last, turning to Joe and pointing his finger at him, he said, &#8220;Do you hear what the Scriptures have to say about such as you&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8216;let him be accursed&#8217;</span> ?&#8221;</p>

<p>Turning to the audience again, the preacher said, &#8220;We are taking the third step toward an offending brother, the step of bringing the matter before the church,&#8221; and he then repeated the results of his visit with Joe alone, and the conference with the official board that morning, saying, &#8220;And now we take the third and last step of bringing the matter before the church. It is with much sadness of heart that we do this, but if Brother Holmier, or rather Neighbor Holmier, had only been willing to heed the warning given by me and by others, this step would not need to have been taken. Much as we regret this loss, we must bear in mind that the faith of our fathers cannot be lightly thrown away for the religious whim of some particular individual. You have heard the grievances that have been brought before you, and so we shall now put it to vote as to what shall be done about it. Shall we keep one who is advocating false doctrine? Shall we forfeit the faith of our fathers for the religious whim of one member of our church? A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump, and unless the leaven is disposed of the entire body is in danger of destruction.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall now take the procedure to have the church as a body settle the question. In this case it is not only one proving himself a traitor, but by his influence he has led his good wife astray also. We do not know how many more will be led astray unless we make him an example as to what will befall those who forfeit the faith of the fathers.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is supporters of the faith that we need. I trust that I have said enough that all may know that we are in grave danger unless some steps are taken to stop heresy among us. We can only deal with this offender as with a heretic or a traitor. We now want the vote of the church. Shall we retain him or shall we exclude him from our midst?&#8221;</p>

<p>Joe sat as one transfixed while Preacher Brumbaugh spoke to the audience, branding him as a traitor and a heretic, while poor Susie and some others of the sisters wept aloud. She saw the predicament they were now in. They must either deny their newfound joy, and the real knowledge of God, or be excluded from the church. She looked at Joe as he sat across the room from her, and her heart warmed to him as never before, for she knew that it was not right for him to bear all the blame, and she thanked God for such a husband that would remain quiet under such trying circumstances. She decided in her heart that as soon as services ended she would tell Preacher Brumbaugh Joe was no more to blame than she was and she wanted to bear part of the accusation and not have it all heaped upon Joe. She looked about the room which was now in perfect quietness. At last she saw Brother Metzgar rise to his feet and, leaning on his cane, he said, &#8220;I think, before any of us decide what steps to take against Brother Holmier, we should hear him speak for himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think that is necessary, as it might only cause confusion, and we are here to avoid all of that,&#8221; hastily replied Preacher Brumbaugh. &#8220;We met with the Holmiers this morning, and he plainly stated that he would not acknowledge any wrong on his part and would still have to say that he was living up to all the rules of this church and was no Christian until last Sunday night. I think that is bringing disgrace on this church and rank heresy, and, furthermore, by these statements he has forfeited all rights to our fellowship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I feel that we should hear him for ourselves,&#8221; replied Brother Metzgar, &#8220;for I should not want to act hastily, and want fully to understand the situation before voicing my sentiments.&#8221;</p>

<p>As there were nods from many others in the audience, there was nothing left for Preacher Brumbaugh to do but to give Joe an opportunity to speak for himself. Joe arose before the people to tell his experience. He stood for some little time, gazing about him, while he lifted his soul to God in prayer for help and strength. At last he began to speak, and his voice shook with emotion, but he talked on, telling of his experience as one among them, but of the heavy burden that he carried all the time. It seemed he left nothing unsaid, and many were weeping with him and his wife (for his tears flowed freely as he spoke), but when he came to that part of his story of his deliverance, his tears no longer ran down his face; a light came there that was noticeable to all, and he became bold in his assertions that it meant more to be really free before the Lord than outward form.</p>

<p>When Joe sat down all were surprised to see Susie rise to her feet and begin speaking. She had always been such a timid woman, but she, too, waxed bold, as she added her testimony to that of her husband and concluded with, &#8220;I do not want any one of you to think that he influenced me to do anything, for he did not. I, too, have been burdened for some time but did not let him know anything about it, even though he talked freely to me about his own condition. I never knew until last Sunday night what it really means to be converted.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Susie sat down there was no sound heard in the room except the heavy breathing of some of the little chil- dren who had gone to sleep. Preacher Brumbaugh sat looking at the floor, while others cast glances about them. At last Brother Metzgar arose to his feet again and, clearing his throat, said, &#8220;I will have to say as did Pilate,
<span class="scripture">&#8216;I find no fault in this man,&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+23%3A4" title="Luke 23:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 23:4)</span></a></span>
for if I should find fault with him, I should have to find fault with myself, for he has given my own experience. I know what he means when he tells of the burden he carried for so long, and I know what he means when he tells us that he prayed and reached God so that the burden was lifted. I find no fault with him, and if he was never a Christian until last Sunday night we should be glad to keep him with us now, for he can do more good among us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not when he brings a doctrine with him other than the gospel that we have preached unto you,&#8221; said Preacher Brumbaugh, as Brother Metzgar took his seat.</p>

<p>Here Aunt Sally Pobst rose to her feet and in her squeaky voice said, &#8220;Yes, and I know what Brother Holmier is talking about, too. You all know me, for I have lived here among you almost all my life, and I have been a member of this church for thirty-five years. I joined this church with my husband when I was first married, and lived in the church as a good member for ten years, but when my little girl died, I became burdened like Brother Holmier said he was, for I was afraid I was not ready to meet that little girl again, and I did not want to have to spend all the rest of my life away from her, and then not be able to go where she was. The more I thought on this the heavier the burden became, and at last I just cried out to God to help me and make me to know that I was fit to go to heaven, for I could not go on as I was then. I know what he is talking about when he says that he knew when the burden lifted, for I reached God and the burden left me, too. I have never felt that way anymore, for I knew then and I know now that I am ready to meet my little girl. I do not know what a heretic is, but if that is what Brother Holmler is, I guess I am one, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this she sat down, and before anyone else had time to say a word, Preacher Brumbaugh was on his feet, and as he stretched his hands out over the audience he said, &#8220;I am here as your leader and spiritual adviser. I am the watchman that you have selected to sound the warning when danger is near, and I have sounded the warning. Shall we let the faith of our fathers be destroyed? All along through the Christian era some have had to be examples that others might take warning, and much as I regret to say it, I feel that Neighbor Holmier must be an example for others. Shall we do as the Bible says,
<span class="scripture">&#8216;let him be accursed&#8217;</span>?
All of you have heard that he is telling you something that has never been preached to you before and we have preached the gospel to you. I see nothing else to do but to brand him as a heretic and an alien, unless he shall come in as he has been heretofore and submit to the rules and teachings of the church.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God forbid that I shall ever have to carry such a burden another day such as I have carried for the last few months,&#8221; said Joe.</p>

<p>Here Preacher Brumbaugh&#8217;s face reddened and, pointing his finger at Joe said, &#8220;It is not necessary to hear any more from you, for you have caused enough contention for one evening.&#8221; Then, turning to the audience, he said, &#8220;We want to see who will be loyal to the faith. If you are willing to stand by the gospel you will not stand by Neighbor Holmier, for he is a heretic and traitor to the faith, as you have heard him state this evening. This is going to be a test of loyalty. All who feel that he has forfeited his right as one of us, in that he has denied the faith, and by so doing has made himself a heretic and a traitor to the cause and the faith for which we stand, will you please rise to your feet and stand with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>At this all the official board rose to their feet first and were soon followed by others, until sixty members were on the floor, standing until Preacher Brumbaugh could count the number. &#8220;That will do,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Now, I shall give the remainder of you a chance to show your colors. How many of you favor retaining Neighbor Holmier among us&#8212;rise to your feet.&#8221; At this Aunt Sally Pobst and Brother Metzgar both rose, and Brother Metzgar said again, &#8220;I find no fault in him.&#8221; A number of the members present did not vote either way.</p>

<p>There was a pause for some time after the last expression among the members, but Preacher Brumbaugh turned to Joe and said, &#8220;You see how impossible it is for one to be a heretic or a traitor to God&#8217;s cause among such loyalty as there is here. I trust that you may be an example to others, that they may fear to bring disgrace on the faith. You may consider yourself an alien and an outcast among us from this time on.&#8221; Then, asking the congregation to arise, he pronounced, &#8220;And now may the love of the Father, the saving grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the fellowship of the Spirit, rest and abide with us all, now and forevermore. Amen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joe and Susie had very little to say to each other on their way home from services that evening, as each was busy with his own thoughts, but after they had put the children to bed, Joe picked up the Bible from the table, gathered it to his bosom, and heavy sobs shook his frame.</p>

<p>The two knelt together and with their arms about each other, with the tears flowing freely over their cheeks, they asked God to help them at this time and draw them closer to Him and to each other, to give them grace for this trial, and lead them into the thing that He required of them to do, asking also for the scripture they needed that evening. Joe opened his Bible and began to read from the <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+13">thirteenth chapter of Hebrews</a>.
As he read, he felt that God would surely help him in this, his first trial. When he reached the latter clause of the fifth verse he let his faith rest on the promise,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+13%3A5" title="Hebrews 13:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 13:5)</span></a></span>
At the close of the sixth verse, as he read,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+13%3A6" title="Hebrews 13:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 13:6)</span></a></span>
he could get no further, but, walking to and fro in the room, he shouted the praises of God, for the blessing of the Lord flowed down into his soul. Again folding the Bible to his bosom, he said, &#8220;I thank thee, Lord, that I can take Thy Word as <i>the man of my counsel</i>.&#8221;</p>
