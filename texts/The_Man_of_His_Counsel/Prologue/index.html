<h1>Prologue</h1>

<p>Joe Holmier stood leaning against the door of his big bank barn, gazing across the well-kept acres of the farm on which he lived. Rich indeed had been the fruitage of his fields that year. His wheat, oats, and hay had been harvested and stored away, and the corn, with stalks seared by the touch of early autumn, promised an abundant yield. His cattle were sleek and fat; his horses well-groomed and in good condition; and his young porkers, which he could see in the field some distance away, promised meat for Joe and his family for the winter.</p>

<p>Joe&#8217;s labors on the farm that summer had been well rewarded and he had been blessed above many of his neighbors. The wool from his sheep had netted him a nice little sum, sufficient to provide clothing for himself and family, and the fowls in his yard had been a great help. On the hillside Joe could count thirty-seven young turkeys that would be ready for the Thanksgiving market.</p>

<p>All this did not escape his eye as he stood there in deep meditation. The October sun was just sending its last faint rays across the meadow before it disappeared behind some trees which fringed the river at the rear of his farm. Its slanting rays fell full upon the house, which stood some distance from the barn, lighting up its windows with a fiery glow.</p>

<p>Joe gazed about the place for some time, then directed his glance toward the house, as he saw the curtains at the window separate and a little, curly head appear between them. The rays of the sun falling full upon the curls made them shine as gold. There was a wave of a child&#8217;s hand at the window, which Joe returned, and which seemed to break the spell that had come over him. &#8220;God bless the dear little fellow,&#8221; said he; &#8220;I have done as I desired to do for him and am glad that I have a good living for my babies. But all this has not satisfied me. There is something more that I want: and just what that is I do not know, but I must have something that will give me rest. My fields of grain, my stock, my money, have not brought to me the satisfaction that I desire. I mean to tell Susie tonight.&#8221; And at this he closed the barn door and started toward the house.</p>
