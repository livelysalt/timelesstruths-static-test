<h1>Conversation 1</h1>

<p>Mr. Wiseman (sitting by the fireside)&#8212;Well, I never read such a paper! What will people get to teaching anyhow? Say, Sarah, have you read any in this paper?</p>

<p>Mrs. Wiseman&#8212;What paper, James?</p>

<p>Mr. W.&#8212;This religious paper I found on the sitting room table. I never saw such reading. Where did you get it?</p>

<p>Mrs. W.&#8212;I&#8217;ve been reading it for the last four or five weeks. I think cousin Jane is having it sent to us; for you remember that when she was here last summer she told us about this paper and the people who publish it.</p>

<p>Mr. W.&#8212;Oh, yes, the saints! But whoever heard of such a thing as a saint on earth? The saints are all in heaven, for the Bible says, &#8220;We shall be crowned saints in glory.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. W.&#8212;I don&#8217;t remember reading that in the Bible. You must have read it in our hymnal. The Bible speaks of saints.</p>

<p>Mr. W.&#8212;I know the Bible says something about the saints, but it is those who have gone to heaven. It doesn&#8217;t mention saints on earth.</p>

<p>Mrs. W.&#8212;I think it speaks of saints here on earth. Let me get my Bible and see. Paul begins the Ephesian epistle like this: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the <i>saints</i> which are at Ephesus.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+1%3A1" title="Ephesians 1:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 1:1)</span></a></span> So there were saints at Ephesus. Also, in his second letter to the Corinthians he says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;With all the saints which are in all Achaia.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+1%3A1" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 1:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 1:1)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Mr. W.&#8212;Well, I&#8217;ve belonged to the church nearly two score years; I&#8217;ve heard our best preachers, and I never heard them tell about saints. I don&#8217;t expect a paper like this to teach me anything. I knew what it is to be a Christian long before this paper was published.</p>

<p>Mrs. W.&#8212;It&#8217;s not only the paper, James, that talks of saints, but the Bible also calls Christians saints. I believe we should take what the Bible says. Cousin Jane says there are a great many saints where she lives.</p>

<p>Mr. W.&#8212;Well, I do hope they&#8217;ll not come East. I shouldn&#8217;t want to see so strange a thing as a saint.</p>

<p>Mrs. W.&#8212;Well, I like their paper anyhow. I read every word in it, and I want you to subscribe for a year when the ten weeks are out.</p>

<p>Mr. W.&#8212;Subscribe for a year! I&#8217;ll not have it in my house. I&#8217;m not going to have my children reading such nonsense. Let me read you a few words here&#8212;&#8220;On the fifteenth of last September I was thrown from a hack. In the fall I struck my head and fractured my right shoulder. My circumstances seemed to require that I continue my work, which the Lord enabled me to do without laying off a day.&#8221; Here is one who says he has been healed of paralysis; another says he has been healed of a tumor and of sore eyes. Did you ever hear such nonsense? You know there&#8217;s not a better educated man or preacher than our presiding elder, and I&#8217;ve heard him say that the days of miracles are past.</p>

<p>Mrs. W.&#8212;I like our presiding elder very much, but let me say, since I&#8217;ve been reading this paper I feel more like looking to God and the Bible than to man. Now, where does the Bible say the days of miracles are past?</p>

<p>Mr. W.&#8212;Well, I&#8217;m going to believe what our presiding elder says, and not believe every new thing that comes along.</p>

<p>Mrs. W.&#8212;But it&#8217;s no new thing, James. This is not the work of man I&#8217;m reading you; it&#8217;s the Bible. Which are you going to take, the Bible or man?</p>

<p>Mr. W.&#8212;I think our church and our preachers are good enough. I&#8217;ve stood by them forty years and I&#8217;m not going to be turned aside in my old days.</p>

<p>Mrs. W.&#8212;I think we ought to believe the Bible, for even the very best man might be mistaken, but the Bible makes no mistakes. We never get too old to learn.</p>

<p>Mr. W.&#8212;I see you mean this last remark for me. Well, I&#8217;m too old for such a paper as this to teach me anything.</p>

<p>Mrs. W.&#8212;But I want to read you what the Bible says about healing. I&#8217;ll read you from Mark: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+16%3A15-18" title="Mark 16:15-18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 16:15-18)</span></a></span> Now, Husband, the Bible says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;These signs shall follow them that believe.&#8221;</span> The great trouble today in our church is they don&#8217;t believe. Cousin Jane sent me a book called <i>Divine Healing of Soul and Body</i>, and in it I read of many who have been healed of different diseases.</p>

<p>Mr. W.&#8212;Well, Sarah, I think you&#8217;ll get to be a saint pretty soon.</p>

<p>Mrs. W.&#8212;If to be a saint is to be right with God, I pray him to hasten the day. The way we&#8217;ve been living is very unsatisfactory to me. But I want to read you more of what the Bible says about healing. I&#8217;ll read from James: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+5%3A14-15" title="James 5:14-15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 5:14-15)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Mr. W.&#8212;Well, I don&#8217;t believe that we can be healed in these days. So that ends that; I just don&#8217;t believe it.</p>

<p>Mrs. W.&#8212;As for my part, I&#8217;m beginning to believe that God can and will heal in these days. I&#8217;ve been taking medicine, as you know, for eight years; but I&#8217;m almost ready to conclude that if I&#8217;m ever well, God will have to heal me.</p>

<p>Mr. W.&#8212;I&#8217;m very much afraid, Mother, it&#8217;ll not be long until you are as crazy as the rest of these people seem to be, and that will be a sad day at our house.</p>

<p>Mrs. W.&#8212;Well, I&#8217;m tired of living in sin. My poor soul is sick.</p>

<p>Mr. W.&#8212;Living in sin! Why the Bible says, &#8220;He that saith he liveth and sinneth not is a liar, and the truth is not in him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. W.&#8212;Where does the Bible say that?</p>

<p>Mr. W.&#8212;I don&#8217;t know just where, but I can find it.</p>

<p>Mrs. W.&#8212;Well, you find it while I see to baking my bread.</p>
