<h1>Daniel&#8217;s Dragon</h1>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; Daniel sat back on his heels to inspect the Lego house he and Rosie had been building. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s the best one we&#8217;ve ever made.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty,&#8221; said four-year-old Emma, leaning close to admire the tall red chimney and white-framed windows. Kyle, who was only two, grinned and waved a Lego in the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t touch!&#8221; Daniel shot a warning look at the two little watchers and carefully picked up the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute!&#8221; Rosie called, diving back into the Lego box. She came up with a handful of flowers and lined them up by the front walk. &#8220;Now it&#8217;s perfect!&#8221; she said, smiling with satisfaction. &#8220;Let&#8217;s show it to Chad and the others, now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Daniel, stowing it away on the shelf, &#8220;let&#8217;s save it till Dad gets home.&#8221;</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t until Bible story time, before bed, that Daniel remembered the house. He wanted to go get it, but Dad was reading and so he knew he must sit still and listen. The story was about Joseph and his brothers, and how they had thrown him in a pit and sold him away as a slave. Daniel had heard it many times before, but still liked it very much. He imagined how he would be brave and good like Joseph, if he was a slave.</p>

<p>So it was the next morning before they got their chance to show the Lego house. After they had finished washing the breakfast dishes, Daniel said, &#8220;Come on, Rosie. Let&#8217;s go get the house!&#8221;</p>

<p>They hurried to the school room, but stopped short at the door. In the middle of the floor sat Emma and Kyle with the house. Kyle&#8217;s hands were full of Lego pieces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no!&#8221; Rosie wailed, and ran to snatch away the broken house. Kyle looked up in surprise, and Emma began to cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;You naughty children!&#8221; Daniel cried. &#8220;I <i>told</i> you not to touch it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on here?&#8221; Dad said, stepping into the doorway.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_4/dragon_legos.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="155" /></div>
<p>&#8220;They just wrecked it&#8212;our Lego house we made,&#8221; Daniel said bitterly. &#8220;And it took us a whole week to make it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the best one we ever did, and we were just going to show it to everyone,&#8221; Rosie sniffed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And they weren&#8217;t allowed to play with it,&#8221; added Daniel. His throat felt tight and he wanted to cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but it looks like you put it in the wrong place,&#8221; Dad said, patting him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>Daniel shrugged away. &#8220;It&#8217;s all Emma&#8217;s fault,&#8221; he muttered angrily. &#8220;Kyle couldn&#8217;t reach it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just looking at it,&#8221; Emma began, tearfully, &#8220;but Kyle came and&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Daniel turned away and hurried from the room. He didn&#8217;t care what she said; Emma was a bad girl and very, very naughty! And Dad didn&#8217;t even scold her. Daniel ran to his room and buried his head under his pillow.</p>

<p>Soon he heard the door open and footsteps come up to the bed. Daniel lay very still and pretended to be asleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daniel, I know this is a disappointment to you,&#8221; Dad&#8217;s voice said gently. &#8220;But do you really think a Lego house is worth crying over?&#8221; He sat down beside the bed. &#8220;I know you spent a long time making it, but it would&#8217;ve been taken apart anyway. You wanted to show it to us, but sometimes things don&#8217;t happen the way we would like. We need God&#8217;s help to forgive others when they do wrong to us. Remember Joseph?&#8221; Daniel thought of Joseph in that dark hole. He remembered how his big mean brothers had sold him as a slave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joseph could have been angry and bitter towards his brothers,&#8221; Dad continued. &#8220;But by God&#8217;s help he was able to love them instead. It was like being a knight and killing a big, green dragon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel peeked at Dad from under the pillow. Was he just being funny?</p>

<p>But Dad continued seriously, &#8220;Imagine if a dragon was trying to eat Emma. What would you do? I know you feel mad at her now, but imagine if a big, green dragon came along. If you could, you&#8217;d fight him off, wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221; Daniel thought of big, green dragons and knew what he would do.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would get a big sword and chop off his head,&#8221; he said, pulling off the pillow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even if Emma really meant to wreck your house?&#8221; Dad asked. &#8220;You might really need to ask God to help you love her. You see, being angry and hating someone is like a big dragon. Only by love can you kill it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel was quiet. If Joseph was able to forgive some big, mean brothers, he should be able to forgive a little, naughty sister. But he really liked that house, and she shouldn&#8217;t have touched it. Forgiving her was so hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t we pray?&#8221; Dad said. He knelt down beside the bed and prayed first, and then it was Daniel&#8217;s turn.</p>

<p>Daniel took a deep breath and began, &#8220;Dear Lord, help me to love Emma.&#8221; He thought of the broken house, but went on, &#8220;And help me to forgive her even though she broke my house. Amen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about that dragon?&#8221; Dad asked with a smile, when he opened his eyes.</p>

<p>Daniel smiled back. His heart felt light and happy now. &#8220;I think it is quite dead,&#8221; he said.</p>

<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_4/Conquering_Love/index.html">Conquering Love</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Conquering Love</h1>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+13%3A13" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 13:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 13:13)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Do you know what conquering means? It means winning and being stronger than another person or thing. It is succeeding at what you do, and not losing or failing. When an army wins, it conquers over its enemies. When love conquers, it means that nothing can stop it.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve sung the song &#8220;Jesus Loves Me,&#8221; haven&#8217;t you? But do you know that Jesus&#8217; love, sometimes called charity, is a special kind of love? It is different from the kind that says, &#8220;Mommy, I love you!&#8221; and then pouts and doesn&#8217;t want to help work. That love doesn&#8217;t last long. But Jesus&#8217; love is much better than that. His love always conquers.</p>

<p>When Jesus was a boy, He probably had to work when He didn&#8217;t want to. But He did it cheerfully anyway, and didn&#8217;t complain. When people called Him names and laughed at Him, Jesus was still kind and good to them. When they beat Him and took Him away to die on the cross, He forgave them. Why? Because of His love.</p>

<p>Our kind of love gets tired of being cheerful and kind, but Jesus&#8217; love never does. It conquers over grumpy thoughts, selfishness, hate, and wrong. Because of that love, Jesus died to save all the naughty and bad people of the world. He loves the people that everyone else hates. Jesus wants all of them to be happy and good and have a home in heaven. Because of that love, Jesus wants to help every boy and girl to live right.</p>

<p>Jesus wants to give you His kind of conquering love. He will put it in your heart so you can give His love to others. When you love people no matter if they are mean to you, that is Jesus&#8217; love. With His love you are not selfish to want your own way. With His love you don&#8217;t think you are better than others. His love helps you do your work cheerfully. His love is always kind, and thinks of how to make others happy. His love never stops. It never runs out. If you are going to follow and obey Jesus, you need to have this conquering love, too.</p>

<h2>Finding Animal Tracks</h2>
<p>Winter is a good time to look for tracks of wild animals. If you don&#8217;t live where it snows, try studying muddy places in the woods or by ponds and streams. It is fun to discover what kinds of wild creatures live near you, even if you never see them. God made many interesting creatures for us to enjoy, so wrap up warm and go on a winter hunt with your family!</p>

<p>Each animal has its own track. A good track guide* is helpful to use when you are looking at prints and tracks. Often there will be other clues to help you. Are there pieces of chewed nut shell? A squirrel lives nearby. Do the tracks lead to a garbage can? A raccoon probably came by in the night. So keep your eyes open and you will be surprised how many things you can find.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grandpa, Edward&#8217;s not being nice,&#8221; complained five-year-old Sammy with a frown.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just said,&#8221; began Edward, &#8220;that he wouldn&#8217;t be my friend if he didn&#8217;t play nicely.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grandpa looked at the two boys thoughtfully. Then he said, &#8220;If you get Alice, I will tell you a story about two boys that lived long ago. It is called:</p>

<h1>A True Friend</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Samuel+18-20">I&nbsp;Samuel 18-20</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Jonathan was a prince that loved God. His father, Saul, was a proud king and did not obey God, even though God had made him king over all Israel. King Saul wanted his son to be great and strong like him. &#8220;After me,&#8221; he said to Jonathan, &#8220;you will be king.&#8221;</p>

<p>But God had chosen someone else, a boy named David, to be the next king. One day Jonathan met David, the shepherd boy. An enemy giant had made all King Saul&#8217;s army very afraid, but David had not been afraid. He had trusted in God to help him, and killed the great giant with a rock and a sling. When Jonathan saw the brave shepherd boy, he wanted to be his friend. He saw that David loved God and wanted to do what was right. Jonathan wanted a friend like that.</p>

<p>David and Jonathan became good friends&#8212;closer even than brothers are. Jonathan loved the brave shepherd and wanted to share everything with him. &#8220;Here is my robe and sword,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want you to keep them as a promise of our friendship.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not long before King Saul hated David. David won many battles over their enemies, which made King Saul jealous. But Jonathan was not jealous. He loved David and was glad that God was helping him. Everyone else liked David, too. King Saul began to be afraid that David might try to become king.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said to Jonathan, &#8220;and we shall kill David.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Jonathan asked. &#8220;He hasn&#8217;t done anything wrong.&#8221; But King Saul only got angrier. Jonathan was worried for his friend. He warned David about his father&#8217;s plan so that he could escape. This happened several times.</p>

<p>Soon King Saul got very angry with Jonathan and said, &#8220;You are a very bad son! All we have is trouble since you&#8217;ve been David&#8217;s friend! How will you ever become king if he lives?&#8221; But Jonathan was not upset that David would become king instead of him. He loved David so much that he didn&#8217;t mind if he was liked better.</p>

<p>So Jonathan went to warn David one last time. Jonathan was very sad, but he knew that his friend would have to hide if he would be safe. &#8220;Go in peace,&#8221; he said to David. &#8220;Remember our promise that we will be friends forever, for the Lord will be between us.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>


<p>&#8220;So what do you think?&#8221; Grandpa asked, when the story was finished. &#8220;How did Jonathan act like a true friend to David?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8217;Cause he gave him his sword and robe,&#8221; said Sammy.</p>

<p>&#8220;What else?&#8221; said Grandpa. &#8220;Did he get upset when everyone else liked David?&#8221;</p>

<p>Edward shook his head slowly. &#8220;He was happy and kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even when he knew that David would be king instead,&#8221; added ten-year-old Alice. &#8220;I think that would be hard, &#8217;cause Jonathan was really the prince.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grandpa smiled. &#8220;So how do you think he was able to be so kind and happy about things that David got to do? How come he didn&#8217;t complain about David not sharing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Edward and Samuel just looked at each other. Finally Alice said thoughtfully, &#8220;Prob&#8217;ly because they were so good friends, he just didn&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And because the Lord had given them His love,&#8221; Grandpa added. &#8220;It is always kind and never selfish. With His love we can be true friends, just like Jonathan was.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Jesus&#8212;the Conqueror: Part 2</h1>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">Note: This is a made-up story about a Jewish boy who lived in Israel when Jesus lived there. In the story, Ethan is pronounced &#8220;AY-thawn,&#8221; Tobi is &#8220;TOE-bee,&#8221; and Mesha is &#8220;MAY-shaw.&#8221; A Rabbi is a Hebrew name for &#8220;Teacher,&#8221; and a Levite is one of the people God chose to specially serve Him in the temple. I do not think that Samaritans would live in Galilee, because the Jews disliked them so much, but I put one there for the story.</p>
</div>


<hr class="minor" />
<p>It was the second day when they crossed the border into Samaria, and Ethan looked around curiously. What was the Rabbi&#8217;s purpose in this place? Samaria was the land of those horrid dogs who had twisted the Law, but still claimed to be followers of the Lord God. They even worshipped God on a mountain, saying that it was better than Jerusalem! Rabbi Jesus was not turning out like he had expected. Somehow he was different from Ethan&#8217;s dreams of a Messiah; but how? He spoke of peace and love. Was he not their conqueror after all?</p>

<p>&#8220;Ethan! Do you know that Rabbi Jesus has sent some men to that Samaritan town over there? They&#8217;re goin&#8217; to ask if we can stay the night!&#8221; Mesha pushed her way through a group of women to reach Ethan&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of it?&#8221; Ethan asked with a frown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t really know! Of course, Jews don&#8217;t&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So the Rabbi doesn&#8217;t act like a Jew,&#8221; cut in Ethan, &#8220;but what are you going to do about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mesha stopped in surprise. &#8220;Oh&#8230;&#8203;well, I guess we can&#8217;t do anything, really. But, Ethan, I thought you <i>liked</i> the Rabbi.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What if I did? I can change my mind, can&#8217;t I?&#8221; Ethan snapped.</p>

<p>Mesha opened her mouth to say something, but then shut it again. Silence hung between them like a thick blanket, and Ethan scuffed at stone in the road. He felt angry&#8212;angry at Mesha for telling things, angry at the Rabbi for mixing everything up, angry at himself for arguing with Mesha.</p>

<p>They walked on without speaking, each thinking their own thoughts. Ethan wished the knot of unkind feelings and frustration in his middle would go away. He wished he&#8217;d never have to meet a Samaritan, or go to one&#8217;s house. Then he remembered Tobi, who had stayed home to watch the sheep; but he quickly pushed that thought away.</p>

<p>Dusk was falling, and the air was chill when the message buzzed through the weary caravan of travelers, &#8220;The Samaritans won&#8217;t let us stay&#8212;that&#8217;s because we&#8217;re heading for Jerusalem, don&#8217;t you know? Cruel rascals, that&#8217;s what they are!&#8221;</p>

<p>The news didn&#8217;t make Ethan any happier. He was hungry and tired and cold. A good warm supper would&#8217;ve tasted good.</p>

<p>&#8220;So what are we going to do?&#8221; Mother was asking.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Rabbi has said we will go to the next village,&#8221; another woman replied.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>&#8220;Unclean! Unclean!&#8221; The wretched call sent shivers down Ethan&#8217;s back, but still he hurried through the crowd to join the men standing near the Rabbi. Ethan looked up at his compassionate face and felt his heart pound. Not over a hundred feet away crouched ten men&#8212;beggarly, dirty, untouchable lepers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jesus, Master&#8212;have mercy on us!&#8221; they pled. What would Rabbi Jesus do?</p>

<p>&#8220;Go, show yourselves to the priest!&#8221; the Rabbi commanded.</p>

<p>That was what people did when they were healed, but these were <i>lepers</i>! Around him, Ethan heard the murmuring of the crowd, but the Rabbi and his followers stood calmly. Slowly the lepers turned, and then hobbling and stumbling, they made off toward the nearby village.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_4/conqueror_leper.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></div>
<p>Then all of a sudden, a glad shout rang out, and Ethan gazed in amazement at the returning figure of a man. It was one of the lepers, or was it? He didn&#8217;t hobble or groan, but came straight up to the Rabbi and fell at his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Master! Oh, praise the Lord God for healing me!&#8221; Tears of gladness fell down the man&#8217;s cheeks, now made new and whole like any other man&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the others?&#8221; the Rabbi questioned. Ethan saw him look up at the murmuring crowd that was pressing around and smile sadly. Then, raising his voice, he said, &#8220;Were there not ten made clean? Where are the nine others? No others have come to give glory to God, but this stranger.&#8221; Ethan glanced quickly from the Rabbi&#8217;s kind face to the healed man at his feet&#8212;a Samaritan. But Samaritans were dogs, they were horrid rascals&#8212;</p>

<p>Suddenly Ethan felt like hiding. Surely the Rabbi would see him and know how he felt, what he was thinking. Somehow Ethan didn&#8217;t want Rabbi Jesus to know. Ethan squeezed his way to the edge of the crowd and started back toward the loaded mules and baggage; he must get away from it all. Leaning against an olive tree, he clenched his fists and closed his eyes. Pictures came back: the Rabbi feeding the crowds on the lake side, the dreams of a conqueror, the hateful thoughts, the last two days traveling in Samaria. But the healing of that Samaritan was the most puzzling of all! Surely the Messiah was only for the Jews. Surely the Rabbi&#8217;s kingdom would be a conquering one. No, he wouldn&#8217;t give up his dreams. Never! But the Rabbi&#8217;s teachings were not to Ethan&#8217;s likings at all.</p>

<p>As they continued south, he kept out of Rabbi Jesus&#8217; way as much as possible; since their argument, he didn&#8217;t talk much with Mesha either. When they entered Jerusalem the next afternoon, Ethan tried to forget the Rabbi all together. The city was large and filled with people preparing for the feast: Jews that had come from all places to celebrate and set up their booths, merchants and shop keepers who were selling their wares, and the Roman guards that stood posted at every corner. Those Romans were another trouble&#8212;but what would the Rabbi say about them? Somehow, Ethan couldn&#8217;t forget about the Rabbi.</p>

<p>As he helped his father get ready for the feast, Ethan kept wondering who the Rabbi was after all. While they were working on their booth, he got up the courage to ask, &#8220;Father, do you really think the Rabbi is the Messiah? Is he our conqueror, or not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Father stopped twisting the willow branches. &#8220;I don&#8217;t rightly know, son. His teachings are different from those we know and teach. But somehow&#8230;&#8203;&#8221; his voice trailed off. Ethan saw his father&#8217;s eyes looking far, far away&#8212;beyond the hillside crowded with waving green booths and the bustling city. Finally, he spoke. &#8220;Yes, I believe this Jesus is the Messiah. But what he will do, I cannot tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard that he is now staying with Cousin Philip,&#8221; Uncle Ruben said then. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we go and hear more of what he is teaching?</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_4/conqueror_thinking.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="262" /></div>
<p>Ethan&#8217;s father and uncle went that night, but Ethan didn&#8217;t go along. He sat outside the booth by himself. Mother, Mesha, and the aunts were all chatting away inside, so he had come away for some peace and quiet. For a long time, he sat there in the cool air and watched the stars come blinking out between the foggy gray clouds. But the words of Rabbi Jesus didn&#8217;t leave him, and in his middle, there was tight, cold feeling that wouldn&#8217;t go away.</p>

<p>Ethan knew what he must do. He knew that he would have to give up his dreams&#8212;and his hatred and anger. Those mean thoughts about the Samaritans would have to go, if he would ever feel any peace. That is what the Rabbi would want him to do.</p>

<p>But he couldn&#8217;t. The mean thoughts were still there; no matter how he tried, he couldn&#8217;t get rid of them. Ethan saw again the gentle good face of the Rabbi and wondered. What was his purpose? If he hadn&#8217;t come to conquer the Romans and throw out the Samaritans, what did he come to do? Now Ethan wanted to know; he had to know.</p>

<p>From inside the booth, Aunt Elizabeth&#8217;s muffled voice broke through his thoughts. &#8220;&#8230;&#8203;I thought that&#8217;s what Andrew said, but I&#8217;ll just have to ask him. The Rabbi would know.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was it! He must find the Rabbi. Scrambling to his feet, Ethan started off toward Cousin Philip&#8217;s booth.</p>

<p>The place was dark and crowded, but Ethan could see Rabbi Jesus sitting with his followers by the merry flames of a cooking fire, one hand raised as he spoke. Ethan found a place next to a wall post where he could stand and listen. Looking at the Rabbi&#8217;s face, glowing in the light of the fire, he remembered how loving and kind he had been to the sick and the poor Samaritan. He remembered how he had taught them to do good and forgive. Deep down inside, Ethan wanted that.</p>

<p>Looking around the room, Ethan saw a man stand to face the Rabbi. He quoted the scripture about loving the Lord God with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind, and loving your neighbor as yourself. The Rabbi answered, &#8220;You have answered right: do this and you shall live.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_4/conqueror_story.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="245" /></div>
<p>&#8220;And who is my neighbor?&#8221; the man said, narrowing his eyes. But Rabbi Jesus didn&#8217;t seem to notice the sneering voice, for he had settled back and begun a story. Ethan listened intently to catch each word. It was about a man that had been robbed by bandits on the winding mountain road to Jericho. And after being beaten up, he was left to die. By chance, a priest came down that road&#8212;but he hurried by without giving any help. Then a Levite came by, who surely ought to have helped, but he also ignored the poor bleeding man. In the end, it was a kind Samaritan who cleaned the hurt man&#8217;s wounds and cared for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Rabbi Jesus, &#8220;which of these three, do you think, was a neighbor to the robbed man?&#8221; He looked from the man, that had questioned him, to the crowded listeners. An uncomfortable silence filled the room. For a moment, his gaze met Ethan&#8217;s, and there was such a loving, kind look in his eyes that Ethan felt tingly all over.</p>

<p>Rabbi Jesus knew, and Rabbi Jesus loved him anyway. Ethan felt so sorry for every mean thought he had had; and, somehow, the Rabbi knew that, too. In the Rabbi&#8217;s eyes was a promise, a promise to help him do right, to love, and to do good. Surely, he was their conqueror&#8212;but it was anger and hate in the heart that he had conquered.</p>

<p>A warm glad feeling filled Ethan&#8217;s heart as he left Cousin Philip&#8217;s booth that night. The cold ache was gone, and how happy he was! He thought of Mesha; she must hear of their conquering Messiah, too.</p>

<p>THE END</p>

<h2>Something You Can Do</h2>
<p>You have heard of the story of the Good Samaritan who showed kindness to a man when no one else did. In the story about Ethan, you can see how Samaritans and Jews were not friends. But Jesus told a story about someone who was different. Do you know that you can be different, too? You can also show kindness to people that nobody else cares about, like old folks and shut-ins.</p>

<p>Here is a simple little gift that you can make, but it is only the beginning of what you can do. You can begin a &#8220;Good Samaritan Club&#8221; and plan many special things to do for others. After the holidays old folks often get sad and lonesome. Your family can go sing songs to them. You could make them homemade bread or cookies, or cards to tell them how you care about them. Show them love as you would to Jesus, for in the Bible it says:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I was sick, and ye visited me&#8230;. Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+25%3A36%2C40" title="Matthew 25:36,40"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 25:36,40)</span></a></span>
</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_4/make_lantern.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="377" /></div>
<h1>Tin Can Lantern</h1>

<p>You will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>a tin can</li>

<li>small, fat candle</li>

<li>a paper strip that fits around the can</li>

<li>ribbon and glue</li>

<li>pencil and tape</li>

<li>wire</li>

<li>nail and hammer</li>

</ul>
<ol>
<li>Fill a tin can with water and put overnight in the freezer.</li>

<li>Design a pattern for your lantern on the paper. Remember, you will have to punch holes on all the lines you make, so don&#8217;t make them too fancy. Some good patterns are lines, diamonds, stars, hearts, or words.</li>

<li>When the ice in the can is firm, you can begin your punching. First tape your pattern around the can. Place the nail on one of the lines you made and hammer a hole. Bigger nails will make bigger holes. It also works best if you begin near the top edge, since that ice may crumble first. If the ice melts too much before you finish, just put it back in the freezer for awhile.</li>

<li>When you are finished, take off the paper strip and let the ice melt in the sink. If the bottom curved out, punch it back in with the hammer. Tap a small nail into the middle of bottom, or punch a hole with a big nail. Now the candle will not wobble when you put it inside. You can also attach a wire handle across the top.</li>

<li>Have someone help you glue a ribbon around the top edge of the can. Tie a bow in it, and add any other decorations that you want. Only put them on the outside so that they won&#8217;t burn.</li>

<li>Press the candle inside and have someone light it. Give it to someone who needs some cheering light!</li>

<h1>Can You Be Trusted?</h1>

<p>&#8220;Tommy,&#8221; Mother called, &#8220;have you finished cleaning your room?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mother.&#8221; Tommy pushed some more toys under the bed. He picked up another book and pushed it in the drawer where his socks were. He looked around. Oh, there was some dirt on the floor in front of the closet! He pushed it under the rug. If Mother had seen that, she wouldn&#8217;t let him go to Jerry&#8217;s house to play.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you ready for me to inspect?&#8221; Mother called again.</p>

<p>But just then the phone rang. So Tommy went downstairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a minute,&#8221; Mother said into the phone. She looked at Tommy hard. &#8220;Are you <i>sure</i> that your room is all cleaned up?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tommy nodded very hard, trying to show Mommy a happy face: the face of a good boy. &#8220;Can I go to Jerry&#8217;s now?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I&#8217;ve cleaned my room.&#8221; When Tommy said this, he felt very bad inside. He knew it wasn&#8217;t really so. <i>It looks better,</i> he thought to himself. <i>But if I just say that it looks better, Mother won&#8217;t let me go.</i> So he said, &#8220;Mother, I did a good job.&#8221; He felt even worse.</p>

<p>Mother didn&#8217;t look as if she believed Tommy. But she let him go while she talked on the phone.</p>

<p>When Tommy came back from Jerry&#8217;s, Mother called from the family room, &#8220;I have a story for us to read.&#8221; Mother could read the most interesting stories in the whole world, so Tommy hurried in.</p>

<p>The story was about a boy and his little sister who had to plant a whole field with a big bucket of beans. He would make a hole in the ground, and she would drop in a bean seed. At first, they worked hard, but the field was very big, and the beans in the bucket went down so slowly. Then the boy had an idea. &#8220;Let&#8217;s drop two beans in each hole,&#8221; he told his sister. This went a little faster, but not fast enough. Then they started dropping three and even four beans in every hole. Finally, they dug a big hole by a stump and dumped in all the rest of the bean seeds. When they went to the house, their mother was quite pleased&#8212;and surprised&#8212;that they were through so quickly.</p>

<p>At this point in the story Mother paused a moment, and Tommy began to feel a little uneasy.</p>

<p>The rest of the story told about how the beans came up. It was the boy&#8217;s bigger brother who discovered the places with two, three, and more beans coming up. And who found the great, big bean patch growing by the stump. Tommy listened more and more shamefully as the children&#8217;s mother talked with them about telling the truth.</p>

<p>When the story ended, Tommy could not look at his Mother.</p>

<p>She was talking in a low voice full of meaning. &#8220;Tommy,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I want to be able to trust you. When you tell me something, I want to believe that you have told me the truth, just as much as you know it. I want your words to be true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; Tommy said in a small voice, &#8220;I did not really clean my room today.&#8221; He felt ashamed now. &#8220;I am sorry. I want you to be able to trust me. I want to always tell the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tommy felt better as he worked hard to clean his room. As he rolled up the rug to clean underneath, he said over and over to himself: &#8220;I want to be a person who can be trusted. I want my words to be true.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Girls,</p>

<p>Now that your jewel of patience is growing rapidly, I hope, are you ready to add another jewel to your golden dress of obedience? One of the most beautiful jewels that you can have is the Gem of Quietness. It is a veil that covers the princess from head to toe. The princess looks very royal wearing this veil over her golden gown. But not many princesses wear one, because it is expensive. You see, a princess must give up some things she likes to wear it.</p>

<p>There was once a princess, named Karen, who had four younger brothers. One day when she was feeding the chickens, she found a tiny white kitten nestled in the hay. Karen scooped up the cold little kitten, and it mewed hungrily. At the house Mama helped her find some milk for it. Karen hoped very much that she could keep it. Her brothers had always wanted a dog, and Daddy said they needed one more than a cat, but he let her keep the kitten. Karen was so happy! She took good care of her new pet and took it with her everywhere. Karen decided to name the kitten Snowball, because it had pure white fur.</p>

<p>Then, one day, visitors came with two little boys. Karen was sent to watch all the boys play outside, so she carefully shut Snowball away in her room. For awhile they played nicely, but then they began to get into mischief. They kept popping from behind the house and laughing at her. Karen felt discouraged, and hot and tired. She wished she could be inside. &#8220;Why do I have to watch the boys anyway?&#8221; Karen thought, as she sat under a tree and waited for them to come back.</p>

<p>That evening Karen couldn&#8217;t find Snowball. She knew she had shut the door&#8212;where could Snowball be? Mother didn&#8217;t know where she was, and Karen couldn&#8217;t find her anywhere. What had happened to her kitten? Finally four-year-old Tony said, &#8220;Tommy put Snowball on a green leaf in the pond.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the pond! Karen rushed out to see, but she did not find Snowball. Karen felt angry at Tommy&#8212;how did he get Snowball anyway? She found him in the sand pile. He did not look happy when she asked him about the kitten, but he pretending he didn&#8217;t do anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you did! Tony said you put her in the pond!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not. I mean, well, it wasn&#8217;t <i>my</i> idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you put her in,&#8221; Karen cried, &#8220;Where is she <i>now</i>?!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8212;uh&#8212;put her on a lily pad, &#8217;cause we wanted to see if she&#8217;d float. But she couldn&#8217;t, and well, I guess she fell in and we couldn&#8217;t get her out. Mom doesn&#8217;t let us go in the pond, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Karen. She felt like hitting Tommy and yelling at him for being so mean! Snowball had drowned. Big tears filled her eyes. Then a soft voice whispered, &#8220;Remember your Crown of Love?&#8221; Blinking back the angry tears, Karen asked God to help her love Tommy. And do you know? Karen didn&#8217;t feel like hitting or yelling at Tommy anymore. Over her Crown of Love had been slipped a beautiful shinning Veil of Quietness and Karen felt all peaceful inside, even though she didn&#8217;t have Snowball anymore.</p>

<p>Karen had to give up feeling angry at Tommy and love him, before she could get her Veil of Quietness. Sometime you may have to give up something like Karen did, too. You&#8217;ll have to ask King Jesus for Love first, because Love always comes before the sweet Veil of Quietness.</p>

<p><b>NOTICE</b>: For some time there has been a burden among us for a paper with the purpose of serving the needs of people of different ages, for both men and women. To this end, the paper <i>Foundation Truths</i> has been started. We are planning to send the first (Winter) issue to everyone receiving <i>Treasures of the Kingdom</i>, within the next couple months, Lord willing. You will not be sent any more, unless you request them.</p>

<p><i>Treasures of the Kingdom</i> will continue to be published as a separate, bi-monthly paper for the younger ages (around 5-10 years). We continue on with the desire to present the high standard of truth through what we print. Therefore, we are careful in what we put in these pages, desiring only that the light of God would be shed abroad in this land of darkness. Please pray for us that He would have His way in this work.</p>

<p>For both these papers, subscriptions are free as always.</p>

<p>God&#8217;s bountiful blessings of love through the Savior to all of you!</p>
