<h1>Letters from the Heart&#8230;&#8203;</h1>

<h2>Nothing but the Best</h2>
<p>Greetings in Jesus Name from Montezuma! I hope this letter finds you growing
<span class="scripture">&#8220;in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+3%3A18" title="II&nbsp;Peter 3:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 3:18)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Yesterday, Bethany stepped on a harmless-looking pile of ashes, but hot coals were undemeath! She screamed and cried for a while, but we finally soothed the bums on her feet by soaking them in cold water for hours. She seemed better toward the evening until Dad put aloe-vera gel on her burns. (The doctor had told us to do so.) She was crying hysterically because of the pain and Dad was afraid she&#8217;d go into shock from staying in cold water for so long. We were all trying to find a way to sooth her by asking her what she wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beth, do you want some juice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You want your doll?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Want me to read you a book?&#8221;</p>

<p>She ended all this by saying (or sobbing out), &#8220;I just want to be healed!&#8221;</p>

<p>So we <i>prayed</i>! We also called some friends to pray. And, almost suddenly, she calmed down and the pain stopped. She was ecstatic and we were so thankful! The next day she was walking fine. Praise the Lord!</p>

<p>Yesterday I was happily surprised to see <i>Dear Princess</i> (<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6">the Summer issue</a>) in the mail! I <i>really</i> enjoyed it and was encouraged and strengthened by quite a few articles especially! Thanks <i>so</i> much, Skye, for sending it to me! I read the child&#8217;s story &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Penny_Plays_Rabbit/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Penny Plays Rabbit">Penny Plays Rabbit</a>&#8221; to Bethany, and then Bethany enjoyed it a second time when I read it to her and Noah! They both really liked it, and so did I! I think &#8220;Stitches &#8217;N&#8217; Stories&#8221; is a wonderful addition to <i>Dear Princess</i>! Laura&#8217;s illustrations for &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/True_Love/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/True Love">True Love</a>&#8221; were <i>darling</i> and beautiful! Thanks so much, Laura! &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/The_Gift_of_Conversation/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/The Gift of Conversation">The Gift of Conversation</a>&#8221; was a <i>good</i> reminder for me! When we just focus on ourselves, what opportunities to reach out are missed! &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Pikas_Treasure_What_About_Mine/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Pika's Treasure&#8212;What About Mine?">Pika&#8217;s Treasure&#8212;What About Mine?</a>&#8221; was <i>so</i> good! I really appreciate Lisa sharing ways in which Jesus&#8217; Words have kept her from sinning.</p>

<p>One thought that seems to instantly stomp out the devil&#8217;s fires of discontent or wishful dreaming in my heart, is this: God (the Maker of the universe, Master Designer, King of Creation, my Merciful Redeemer and Unfailing Friend Who wants <i>nothing but the best for me</i>!) <b>has a perfect plan fit my life</b>! Praise the Lord! When I really dwell on that glorious truth&#8212;I get so excited! My &#8220;running ahead of God&#8217;s plan&#8221; immediately stops. My heart is then at rest (no more fear of the future!) when I realize that the safest place to be is in the will of God! May we always <i>stay in His will</i>! (I don&#8217;t want to imply the untruth that it&#8217;s so easy for me to surrender to God&#8217;s will and plan, my heart only thrills to this thought when I dwell on it with an open heart!)</p>

<p>Another thing that is so comforting to me is to realize that whenever we fall, the Lord wants us to run back to Him, wash in the blood of Jesus and re-surrender ourselves to Him&#8212;immediately! So many times I feel like I have to linger, like the Prodigal Son, for a while before I &#8220;arise and go unto my Father&#8221;&#8212;but I was so glad to find that this was wrong. How would you feel if Amanda did something wrong to you and when you were wanting so truly to forgive her and embrace her, she stayed miserably in the shadows? I love this sentence: &#8220;The greatest wrong we can do to Love is to stay away&#8221;&#8212;Amy Carmichael.</p>

<h2>No Reputation But Christ&#8217;s</h2>
<p>I recently received my first issue of <i>Dear Princess</i> and I really enjoyed it! I love &#8220;finding&#8221; magazines that help and encourage me in my daily walk, and show me that there are many others who are different from the world and who desire to follow and serve our mighty Savior &#8220;with all their hearts&#8221;! Thank you, Skye, for sharing about this magazine with me! I would like to continue to receive <i>DP</i>, and whenever possible, I&#8217;d like to have <i>all</i> the back issues, please. I greatly look forward to getting them and the next issue of <i>DP</i>!</p>

<p>There were many things about <i>DP</i> which I enjoyed (okay, I&#8217;ll be honest&#8212;Ienjoyed all of it!) I found &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Seek_Him_Early/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Seek Him Early">Seek Him Early</a>&#8221; by E. M. Bounds to be a needed challenge to rise earlier and make my time with Him more precious! &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Pikas_Treasure_What_About_Mine/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Pika's Treasure&#8212;What About Mine?">Pika&#8217;s Treasure&#8212;What About Mine?</a>&#8221; by Lisa J. Panasuk was also convicting, especially since patience and cheerfulness are two of the things I usually struggle with daily. Sylvia Kembel&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Throw_Out_the_Lifeline/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Throw Out the Lifeline">Throw Out the Lifeline</a>&#8221; was very good, for it seems to me that family members are the hardest to witness to. How easy it is to worry too much about others&#8217; opinion of us (especially family) instead of what our Father in Heaven wants us to do and what He thinks of us! Your article, Sylvia, was a good reminder that (as you said), &#8220;we have no reputation to lose as our reputation is Christ&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Laura Erickson&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/The_Colors_of_Our_Country/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/The Colors of Our Country">The Colors of Our Country</a>,&#8221; and Hannah L. Clayton&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/True_Love/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/True Love">True Love</a>&#8221; were excellent studies of <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+3%3A12-14">Colossians 3:12-14</a> and <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+13%3A4-8">I&nbsp;Corinthians 13:4-8</a>, respectively. How terribly I fall short of truly loving others as Christ does! Ladies, your articles were eye-openers, and much needed by me. Only with our Redeemer&#8217;s triumphant help can we ever even hope to develop these precious qualities and attitudes.</p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/The_Gift_of_Conversation/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/The Gift of Conversation">The Gift of Conversation</a>&#8221; really has shown me the importance of being hospitable and friendly to others, and Skye, your article, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Forgetting_and_Reaching_Forth/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Forgetting and Reaching Forth">Forgetting and Reaching Forth</a>&#8221; didn&#8217;t go unnoticed or unappreciated either! I often struggle with doing just as the title said, so your words were very encouraging! I was also helped by what you said, Abigail, for it&#8217;s easy to get overwhelmed by trials, whether big or small, and often feel we must do something about it when we only need to keep our eyes on Jesus and give it all to Him!</p>

<p>As with my other magazines, I also loved the reader interview and the letters from fellow sisters in Christ, and even found &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Penny_Plays_Rabbit/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Penny Plays Rabbit">Penny Plays Rabbit</a>&#8221; cute and amusing.</p>

<p>Thank you, Abigail and Skye, for following the Lord&#8217;s leading and publishing this magazine! It is appreciated! I&#8217;ll keep you in my prayers. God bless!</p>

<h2>So Very Important</h2>
<p>Thank you so much for adding me on your mailing list! I just received the Summer &#8217;98 issue, and enjoyed it a lot. &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Pikas_Treasure_What_About_Mine/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Pika's Treasure&#8212;What About Mine?">Pika&#8217;s Treasure&#8212;What About Mine?</a>&#8221; by Lisa J. Panasuk was wonderful! I read it over several times, and each time made a deeper impression on me&#8212;sometimes it&#8217;s so easy to neglect spending time in prayer and Bible study, yet it is so <i>very</i> important! Thank you, Lisa, I need that!</p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/True_Love/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/True Love">True Love</a>,&#8221; by Hannah L. Clayton really hit hard, too, and got me <i>really</i> thinking! Every word was very true and prompted me to examine my own attitude and feelings. The illustrations were great, too, Laura&#8212;I enjoyed looking at them.</p>

<p>I could comment on each article and story, but I suppose it would take too long! Instead, let me say I loved reading <i>Dear Princess</i> from cover to cover and look forward to the next issue!</p>

<p>May God bless you as you continue in His plan!</p>

<h2>A Prayer List</h2>
<p>As I was reading the <a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6">Summer 1998 issue</a> of <i>DP</i>, I came across &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Seek_Him_Early/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Seek Him Early">Seek Him Early</a>&#8221; by E. M. Bounds. And while reading a thought came to me, &#8220;Why not make a list of God&#8217;s blessings, prayer needs and other things and pray about them the next morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Throw_Out_the_Lifeline/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Throw Out the Lifeline">Throw Out the Lifeline</a>,&#8221; by Sylvia Grace Kembel, was an encouragement, since my mom&#8217;s mom and dad are not saved. Thank you, Sylvia, for your encouraging to keep on praying for my unsaved family!</p>

<p><i>DP</i> is <i>so</i> encouraging; keep up the good work, Abigail and Skye!</p>

<h2>All-Seeing, All-Knowing</h2>
<p>Praise the Lord for how He guarded you from the wrong printer! He truly is our protector. I read your article, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Forgetting_and_Reaching_Forth/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Forgetting and Reaching Forth">Forgetting and Reaching Forth</a>,&#8221; in this current issue of <i>Dear Princess</i>. The part about &#8220;I find myself easily doubting about getting married, as there are no possible options around, yet doesn&#8217;t God know?&#8221; I could easily identify with. Sometimes I wonder&#8230;&#8203;but God does know. Just recently a friend of mine began courting, and another became engaged after courting. Hearing their stories reminds me that there is a God Who sees&#8212;El Roi. In one case, the young man had noticed this girl for six years and yet she had no idea that he was interested in her. I was so impressed by what her sister said: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think there was anyone this perfect for Sarah.&#8221; So God knows, and He will get the nght one to the right place at the right time. But pray for me that I will actually live with this faith&#8230;&#8203;</p>

<div class="blurb">
<p class="first">Note: Many of you probably don&#8217;t know what Jennifer is talking about in the first part of her letter.</p>

<p>Several months back, when we were looking into different printing possibilities, we found a man who would be willing to do offset printing for a real cheap price. We then made plans to take <i>DP</i> there&#8230;&#8203;without really consulting the Lord first. We were excited and trusted this man that what he said was truthful. However, we soon found out that we were wrong.</p>

<p>Upon finishing the last stages of the Summer issue, we decided we&#8217;d just go ahead and send our masters through the mail. However, Mr. Spinks didn&#8217;t think that a wise idea and announced that he would take it for us&#8230;.</p>

<p>When he arrived back home, we had some shocking news. Not only was this man a fraud who didn&#8217;t have anything in the way of equipment for printing but he was also going to take it somewhere else and later charge us more than double what he first quoted us.</p>

<p>We praise the Lord for His mercy to us in helping us to discover this <i>before</i> it happened&#8230;. He has provided us with another printer in Nebraska, and we&#8217;re thankful for this lesson!</p>

<h2>As Strangers and Pilgrims</h2>
<p>Thank you for printing <i>Dear Princess</i>. I found this issue so encouraging&#8212;both yours and Abigail&#8217;s articles were so good. &#8220;Forgetting the past.&#8221; Hmmm&#8230;&#8203;something extremely difficult to do. I am glad you are writing about it, as I often need to be reminded of that!</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m glad I &#8220;met&#8221; you and Abigail! And I am <i>very</i> thankful for <i>HC</i> and <i>DP</i>. They often come right when I need them the most. I am also very thankful God has given us His Word, good books to read, fellowship with godly families (through the mail for now), and excellent magazines!</p>

<p>I suppose you are wondering who I am, my family etc&#8230;.</p>

<p>I was born in Oregon in 1984 and lived near Eugene with my parents until I was 8. We then moved to Oklahoma and lived there for three years. I did not like living in OK because I was afraid of the storms and tornadoes. God was very gracious for protecting us while we lived there. Then in spring of &#8217;95 my nana was diagnosed with cancer, and so we moved out here to care for her and Grandpa. In the fall of that year Nana finally, after years of prayer, accepted Jesus as her Lord and personal Savior. She died in &#8217;96, and now we are taking care of my grandpa. He is not open to Jesus, but we are praying for him.</p>

<p>We are living in an apartment right now, in the middle of the city, in southern California. I live with my Daddy (Mark), Mom (Ann), and one sister (Hope), who&#8217;s 9. I enjoy reading my Bible and other Godly books, cooking, baking, making stationary, cross-stitching, playing with stuffed bears with Hope, and more.</p>

<p>We dress modestly&#8212;I wear below-the-knee dresses, jumpers, skirts, and split-skirts all the time. We read mostly the King James Version of the Bible and believe in courtship (saving one&#8217;s heart for her future husband). Hope and I have been homeschooled our whole lives and are thankful for it. Mom is a keeper at home, and is teaching Hope and me to follow Jesus, to be submissive to our dad, and other &#8220;keeper at home&#8221; things. Daddy is a great father! He teaches all of us so much. He likes to communicate and talk things out, joke, make us laugh, lift people up, and tell people about Jesus&#8212;how Jesus changed his life and how He can change theirs. Daddy doesn&#8217;t have a job right now. He is studying in computers, and we are praying God will provide him with a pleasant job afterwards. We don&#8217;t &#8220;fit in&#8221; here at all! I&#8217;m glad that we don&#8217;t, but I wish the people here weren&#8217;t worldly. God has and is really calling us away from the world to peace and a quiet lifestyle. We don&#8217;t have TV, don&#8217;t go shopping, don&#8217;t go to the beach, don&#8217;t go to movies, don&#8217;t believe in dating, etc. I am glad we are being called away&#8212;I wouldn&#8217;t want to &#8220;fit in&#8221; here.</p>

<p>I need to be going now&#8230;&#8203;I&#8217;d love to hear from you when you can write, but no hurry.</p>

<h2>Forgetting and Reaching Forth</h2>
<p>How can we tell you or thank you for sending <i>Dear Princess</i> to us?! We <b>absolutely loved it</b> because of the deep spiritual content! Please do keep us on your mailing list. We would like to donate, but don&#8217;t have any personal money at the moment. We hope to send something soon. We also appreciated your desire to &#8220;freely give.&#8221; What a blessing! The Lord has also laid it on our hearts to offer <i>YWSH</i> totally free, starting with this next issue.</p>

<p>How I could relate to your article on &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Forgetting_and_Reaching_Forth/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Forgetting and Reaching Forth">Forgetting and Reaching Forth</a>&#8221; in <i>Dear Princess</i>. That is what I keep having to remind myself. &#8220;Don&#8217;t look back, Melody! Look forward. God has a perfect plan for your life. <b>Just trust Him</b>! You can&#8217;t see the complete picture now, but it really <i>is</i> true.&#8221; In the past, I&#8217;ve found myself looking back, and I know that it caused discontentment with where God had placed me at that time. I don&#8217;t want that to be the case.</p>

<h2>Grace Bigger than Our Problems</h2>
<p>Thank you so much for printing such a wonderful magazine! It is so encouraging to hear what God is doing in other young ladies&#8217; lives. I searched for years to find a magazine for young people whose goal was to help us learn to be more like Christ. Discouraged by my findings (sometimes to the point of being repulsed!), I had nearly give up finding a truly God-centered, uplifting, wholesome magazine. Then, thank God, I met Abigail at OMSI!</p>

<p>There were so many things in this latest issue that spoke to my heart, but I will just mention two that especially encouraged me. The first one was your article, Abigail, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/With_Love_from_the_Editress/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/With Love, from the Editress">With Love, from the Editress</a>.&#8221; I have been extremely depressed lately, but I am not certain I know what was causing it. I have naturally been a little stressed on occasion, but this was abnormally severe. It stretched on day after day, week after week, until I thought I couldn&#8217;t take anymore. I felt like I had a black cloud pushing me down and smothering me. But God&#8217;s grace is much bigger than our problems! Your article was so encouraging to me! (Only God knows how much!) Thank you, Abigail.</p>

<p>The other things that encouraged me was the article by Skye. I especially noticed one paragraph in which she mentioned she sometimes doubted she would get married, as there are no possible options around. I, too, have that problem. No, I shouldn&#8217;t call it a problem, because in His time, if it is His will, He will lead me to the right young man. It was encouraging to read Skye&#8217;s thoughts on this subject.

<h2>More Precious than Silver or Gold</h2>
<p>We (my two sisters and I) received our sample issue of <i>Dear Princess</i>. We really enjoyed it! It&#8217;s so encouraging to see what the Lord is doing. I can certainly see there are the &#8220;seven thousand&#8221; who are seeking to be faithful to the Lord. I believe that we are in the last days and that God&#8217;s people need to encourage each other and build each other up in Bible faith and in obedience to all of God&#8217;s loving requirements.</p>

<p>I sure could relate to Abigail&#8217;s feelings expressed in the editorial, as I have suffered with depression off and on and sometimes don&#8217;t know the cause. Usually, though, if I really search I can find several contributing factors. If I can identify the sources of the sadness, anxiety or resentment, regret&#8212;then I can face that and say, &#8220;It&#8217;s not so bad, especially with the Lord taking care of it,&#8221; and can
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Commit [my] way unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>; trust also in him,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+37%3A5" title="Psalm 37:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 37:5)</span></a></span>
and He will act, as the Psalmist said. Talking faith&#8212;I should do that more. God will not let bad things happen to me while I&#8217;m truly seeking to do what is His will&#8212;unless those bad things are actually for my good. Then He will help me through them, if I stay with Him. Other remedies for anxiety and depression include: singing hymns, prayer, reading <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalms">Psalms</a>, <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah">Isaiah</a>, and other encouraging, uplifting Bible passages, and seeking out someone else to help and encourage and witness to them. Talking of the Savior&#8217;s love, and seeking to enumerate and magnify His charms lifts our hearts and fills us with the Holy Spirit and takes the mind off of self and onto holy, lively, thankful themes.</p>

<p>My favorite article was &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Seek_Him_Early/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Seek Him Early">Seek Him Early</a>.&#8221; It was so true! I always feel I shouldn&#8217;t do studies or read the newspaper, if I haven&#8217;t yet taken time for personal Bible reading. Prayer before meeting and talking with others really makes the difference too. I also liked the picture with it&#8212;outdoors. Even when I lived in the city, I would go out under the stars and ponder God&#8217;s many promises. I recalled how God told Abraham to see the stars and try to number them adding,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;So shall thy seed be.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+15%3A5" title="Genesis 15:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 15:5)</span></a></span>
Another:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+40%3A26" title="Isaiah 40:26"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 40:26)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+19%3A1" title="Psalm 19:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 19:1)</span></a></span>
I feel like exclaiming with the prophet,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Habakkuk+3%3A3" title="Habakkuk 3:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Habakkuk 3:3)</span></a></span>
I feel happy; His love seems real to me; faith and energy spring up anew in my heart, I feel loved and ready to love and to serve in His strength. Nothing I see with my natural eyes are as lasting as the stars or so far out in space. But they are meaningful on/v because seeing them I naturally think of God, who lives on high. Abe Lincoln said he did not know how anyone could look up at the sky and deny the existence of God. Other natural things that really impress me are birds, flowers, and trees.</p>

<p>I also liked the <a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Laying_All_at_His_Feet/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Laying All at His Feet">interview with Angela LeFevre</a>. Thank you, Angela, for sharing with us! Your story touched my heart because I have long had the dream of adopting older children who need a good home and to learn about Jesus right away. Children are precious souls (we should think of everyone that way) and they grow up so fast! Jesus said, &#8220;Let the little children come to me&#8221; (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+10%3A14">Mark 10:14</a>)&#8212;and let their parents come too! If I do marry (if that be the Lord&#8217;s will) I want to consider adoption, as a ministry. Our Heavenly Father has adopted us at a price much more precious than silver or gold&#8212;and building that saving relationship with Him takes time, just as it takes time for the adopted ones to actually feel like family. It must be truly enriching.</p>

<p>I also liked the sharings from Lisa Panasuk, Hannah Clayton, and Sylvia Kembel. I have at times felt the urge to write to someone whom our family has been out of touch for some time, because some Scripture popped out of the page as I was reading and reminded me of that person. Then other kindred verses started coming to mind. I just felt impressed I had to write! Praying about it, I would get out my Bible and paper and pen and write an anonymous letter, leaving off the return address, leaving the Spirit of the Lord to make the impression. Then I could still address the reader personally and wish him/her God&#8217;s special blessing.</p>

<p>I read &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/The_Gift_of_Conversation/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/The Gift of Conversation">The Gift of Conversation</a>&#8221; with intense interest. How my heart felt for the one who wrote it! Perhaps she recently moved to a new place. I can truly sympathize. But let me tell you, I might also speak up on behalf of the short-winded girls. Some people are sensitive and shy because of family or personal troubles. Some have few friends or little time allotted to visit, so they feel overwhelmed when they get together with others, especially with the outgoing type. I&#8217;ve been in those situations. I surely hope I have never impressed someone as being unfriendly or uninterested, though.</p>

<p>Speech is a talent; influence is a talent. So, what about it? Are we using these to encourage and welcome each other to Christ?
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Talk ye of all his wondrous works&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+105%3A2" title="Psalm 105:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 105:2)</span></a></span>!
the Psalmist says&#8230;.</p>

<p>I also could really relate to Skye&#8217;s article, &#8220;Forgetting and Reaching Forth,&#8221; as much of our extended family doesn&#8217;t get along with us because of our faith and &#8220;odd&#8221; practices like homeschooling. As we near the close of time as we know it, truth and error become more distinct from each other as the Great controversy between Christ and Satan becomes more intense. Yet the enemy will seek to deceive even the elect.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;[S]he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+24%3A13" title="Matthew 24:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 24:13)</span></a></span>

<p>May the Lord richly bless you.</p>

<h2>Something I Didn&#8217;t Have</h2>
<p>I am a wife of sevens years and a mother of two beautiful boys. I picked up your <a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6">summer edition</a> of <i>Dear Princess</i> at the Homeschool Conference in Beaverton, OR, on August 28, 1998. I picked it up to take it to show to the young ladies who attend my church. I started to read it and immediately began to cry! All I could think about was how I wished I would have had such a blessed magazine when I was single. I was saved when I was just a child, but I was not raised in a strong Christian family. My mother subscribed me to secular teen magazines and I was pushed to attend college. All through high school I prayed for a godly husband some day, because my heart&#8217;s desire was to be a wife and a mother. Unfortunately, this was not looked upon as praiseworthy, I really struggled because I didn&#8217;t have the guidance, encouragement, or knowledge that I was receiving a Godly call as a woman. After a year and a half of college, I married my high school sweetheart. He was a God-fearing man. Praise God He answered my prayer! I guess what I am trying to say is that I am praising God for your magazine, even though I didn&#8217;t have such a thing available when I was a young woman, but can be sure that I will tell every young woman I can about your <i>Dear Princess</i> magazine! Even though I am married, your magazine encouraged me in my &#8220;single&#8221; walk with the Lord. May the Lord richly bless you for the work you are doing for Him and His Kingdom! You really blessed my soul!</p>
