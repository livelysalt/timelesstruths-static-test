<h2>Meet a Princess: Amy Zander</h2>
<h1>The Lord is My Strength</h1>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_7/strength_flower.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="160" /></div>
<p>Greetings in the precious name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ!
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; But with the <i>precious</i> blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+1%3A18-19" title="I&nbsp;Peter 1:18-19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 1:18-19)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Unto you therefore which believe he is <i>precious</i>.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+2%3A7" title="I&nbsp;Peter 2:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 2:7)</span></a></span>
Skye and Abigail asked me if I would be willing to be interviewed, and I was so surprised! I pray that it will be a blessing to all of you!</p>

<h2>Please tell us about yourself, your interests, goals and values.</h2>
<p>My full name is Amy Adele Zander and I am 17 (my birthday is the 31st of January). I am 5&#8217; tall (and thus find myself looking up at others a lot and getting teased about being short), and have long, curly, dark blackish-brown hair and hazel eyes. My personality is very much like my mother&#8217;s; I am quiet and not real out-going, yet I do enjoy meeting others and spending time in fellowship with like-minded believers. With my family, I live on a very hilly 11-acre farm in western Kentucky where we&#8217;re close to the borders of Missouri, Illinois and Tennessee. My family consists of my father (Chuck), my mother (Mary), and my brothers and sisters, Adam (15), Aaron (12), Austin (10), Arielle (6), and Arianna (3), and we have two blessings in Heaven.</p>

<p>My family and I go to a tiny, very conservative independent, King James Bible-believing, Fundamental Baptists church (consisting of 3 families) in Tennessee, that is almost an hour&#8217;s drive away. For a long time we couldn&#8217;t find a like-minded church, and we homechurched for a while by ourselves, and then after 2 years of &#8220;being by ourselves&#8221;, God led us to our current church, The Old Paths Baptist Church (named after
the verse in Jeremiah about returning to the old paths returning to the old paths [<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+6%3A16">Jeremiah 6:16</a>]).
We&#8217;re very thankful for our church family!</p>

<p>Our family is involved in two ministries with our church, collating King James Bibles and tracts, and painting banners for street preaching. We put together Bibles and tracts that get distributed all over the world to the pastors, missionaries, and people who need them, and we do this as a ministry, not a business (we don&#8217;t sell anything). We just sent off 7 boxes of John and Romans Bibles to England. It is a blessing to be able to put together Bibles that will be used and read by those who receive them. I pray many times over the Bibles, as we work together collating them; wouldn&#8217;t it be wonderful if at least one person came to know the Lord as their Savior through these little Bibles?! About the banners: we paint a colorful, vivid scene of Heaven and hell, or Christ knocking on a man&#8217;s door, or of the cross, or of the great, white throne judgement (using the drawings of Dr. Peter S. Ruckman for our patterns) on a big 4&#8217;x 6&#8217; banners. Each banner has appropriate Scripture(s) to match with each picture, and you&#8217;re able to lift these banners high into the air, as they&#8217;re attached to long rods. Preachers use them on the street, when street preaching, and every banner gets a lot of attention and generates many questions from those on the street. We as a church use them a lot; it is a very effective way to get the Gospel out!</p>

<p>I have many interests! One of my biggest interests is writing. I thoroughly enjoy writing, and moreover, my family and I believe that God&#8217;s Will for my life includes writing articles to encourage and help others to live for the Lord and serve Him. The Lord has given me a ministry through writing and I am so thankful for His help, guidance and wisdom! I also would like to write and publish children&#8217;s books; I am currently working on outlines for several stories. My two sisters provide much inspiration for me!</p>

<p>Other interests include sewing (in which I am ever learning, if somewhat slowly!), cross-stitching, playing the piano (I enjoy playing hymns that bring glory to God, and music is one way that I am able to praise Him!), gardening, and baking. Baking is one of my most favorite &#8220;pastimes&#8221; and it brings great pleasure to me to bake for my family healthy, homemade breads, cookies, cakes, and more, all from freshly ground grains that we&#8217;re able to grind ourselves.</p>

<p>Goals for the future? Always I have the goal of being more like Christ, my dear Savior, more like Him in action, word, and deed. I desire to be pleasing to the Lord:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, 0 Lord, my strength, and my redeemer.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+19%3A14" title="Psalm 19:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 19:14)</span></a></span>
Also, I desire to be the servant of the Lord that He wants me to be. And to me, being a servant of Jesus includes ministering to my family in daily life&#8212;I spend most (99%) with my family and I strive to be pleasing to the Lord through being a godly, obedient, sweet, modest, gentle daughter, sister, and friend. My desire is to one day be an help-meet, wife, mother, and homemaker, and my family and I believe that if it is God&#8217;s Will for me to be married someday, that He will bring my future husband and I together via Biblical courtship and betrothal.</p>

<h2>Please tell us about your family.</h2>
<p>My father (Chuck) works as a front-line manager at a gas diffusion plant that enriches uranium. He was in the Marine Corps for 10 years and then was a contractor at nuclear plants for 11 years, and Dad&#8217;s job, until recently, has moved us around a lot! We&#8217;ve been all over the United States and have stayed in everything from hotels to rental houses, campgrounds to mobile homes, travel trailers to tents! My father is a very friendly, outgoing man, with a heart for lost souls and a desire to follow the Lord wherever He leads him. Dad is attending a small Bible Institute and preparing for the ministry, as God has called him to start a church and be a pastor. Also we believe that God has called our family into the ministry of encouraging and helping other families be faithful, walk the narrow way, and live for Christ. My father is a very special man, and I am very blessed to be his daughter!</p>

<p>My mother (Mary) is the sweetest and godliest woman I know! I do not have to look beyond my family for a <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+2">Titus 2</a> role model, I have one right in my family&#8212;my dear mother! Mom is a gentle, quiet person with a compassionate heart and a willing ear to someone who needs to talk. We enjoy cooking together, talking about homeschooling, and sharing thoughts on what we read in our Bibles each morning. When Mom lost baby Judah, I was really scared for her, and seeing her complete faith and trust in God helped me not to be fearful. <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+27%3A1">Psalm 27:1</a> says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;The L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?&#8221;</span>
Truly the Lord is my light, my salvation, and the strength of my life and I have no need to be afraid! What a wonderful example my mother is to me about trusting God.</p>

<p>Adam is 15 years old, and we are very close. Adam is a lover of music and would play every instrument available if he could! He plays the classical guitar, as well as piano (we take piano lessons together). We encourage and help each other with our music. Adam is a young man who is steadfast in the convictions that God has shown us through His Word, and he has a tender heart, which is sensitive to spiritual matters. He also has a hard time saying no to his younger sisters when they ask him to read a story to them.</p>

<p>Time to introduce Aaron (age 12)! This is my quiet and reserved brother who thinks much and talks little&#8230;&#8203;but when he speaks it is worth listening to him! Aaron isn&#8217;t always reserved though; when he was a baby he was all &#8220;smiles and sunshine,&#8221; and now he is our cheerful one who knows how to make everyone laugh (without hurting someone&#8217;s feelings or making fun of someone) and smile. He is an outdoor man, very energetic, and I don&#8217;t think there is a lazy bone in Aaron! Aaron, like Adam, is also a godly young man who is strong in the faith and in God&#8217;s Word.</p>

<p>At 11, Austin is my youngest brother and he&#8217;s the mischievous one! Teasing his sisters and eating cookies as fast as I can bake them are two of his &#8220;favorite&#8221; things to do. For all his teasing, Austin has a real sweet side to him, and often he&#8217;ll surprise me by doing something special like washing the dishes for me (when it&#8217;s my turn) without saying anything. Austin is quickly growing and will soon be taller than myself just as the other boys are, and he can&#8217;t wait for that moment when he is taller than me! He, just like his other brothers, loves the Lord and is not ashamed of his Savior&#8212;his willingness to witness and his boldness amazes me!</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_7/never_reading.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="130" /></div>
<p>Now comes one of the dearest parts of my family&#8230;&#8203;Arielle (6) Arianna (3)! My sisters and I share a room together (just as the boys share a room together), and we&#8217;re very close. It doesn&#8217;t matter that I am 17 years old and they are 6 and 3, we&#8217;re best friends! (Actually every one of my family members are my best friends!) Arielle and Arianna love to help me bake and are excited that they&#8217;re going to help me with gardening this year! A very advanced reader for her age, Arielle enjoys reading her Bible (she&#8217;s reading through the Psalms right now, and is memorizing <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+121">Psalm 121</a> and <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+113">Psalm 113</a>),
Pathway readers, Jewel books, and as many books as she can get her hands on! Sometimes, instead of my reading the girls a bedtime story (we always try to read a book or two&#8230;&#8203;or three&#8230;&#8203;or four together every day), I have Arielle read Arianna and me a bedtime story!</p>

<p>Arianna is a very cute, very active, very lovable little sister. She is full of giggles, hugs and kisses, and enjoys singing hymns while she plays with her baby dolls and blocks (and she knows many hymns by heart&#8230;&#8203;probably because there is always someone who is either singing or playing favorite family hymns on an instrument). Many times, when Arianna causes me to smile and laugh, I thank the Lord that she is still with us. We almost lost her when she was a little baby, and I am very thankful we still have Arianna.</p>

<h2>Is there any special blessing from the Lord you&#8217;d like to share?</h2>
<p>When we lost our much-loved and much-anticipated baby boy a few months ago, and a grandmother right after, God was very good to us and was our comfort and joy. I received such a special blessing from the Lord then, although my heart was greatly heavy and with pain and sorrow, He enabled me to have joy in the midst of this circumstance. <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+18%3A28-36">Psalm 18:28-36</a> says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;For thou wilt light my candle: the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> my God will enlighten my darkness.For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall. As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him. For who is God save the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>? or who is a rock save our God? It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect. He maketh my feet like hinds&#8217; feet, and setteth me upon my high places. He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great. Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.&#8221;</span>
Jesus was, and still is, so faithful to me, and I was brought to the place where my own strength was gone and was nothing. I had to completely depend on my Savior and His strength&#8212;resting wholly and entirely on Jesus Christ is one of the most restful and wisest things a Christian can do! I received a wonderful blessing from the valley my family and I had trod. Christ strengthened me through His Word and greatly used <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+28%3A6-7">Psalm 28:6-7</a>, which became my main two verses during this hard time:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Blessed be the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications. The L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.&#8221;</span>
We named our baby Judab, which means &#8220;Praise,&#8221; and &#8220;I will praise the Lord,&#8221; because God helped us praise Him. Blessed is the Lord, because He did hear my voice when I cried to Him! He is my strength and my shield (my protection!), and my heart trusted in Him, I was helped, and my heart rejoices! The Lord is so good to His children!</p>

<h2>Would you mind sharing a favorite book, poem or recipe?</h2>
<p>May I share a favorite poem and recipe?</p>

<p>A poem that I found in a little booklet really caught my attention. It speaks of praising the Lord during all times, both in joyful days and in the sorrowful days, and I am reminded of <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+34%3A1">Psalm 34, verse 1</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8220;I will bless the Lord at all times: his praise shall be continually in my mouth.&#8221;</span></p>

<h2>Praise the Lord</h2>
<p class="author">Linda Dallis</p>

<p class="verse">If we only praise the Lord,<br />For all the things in life<br />That fill our hearts with laughter, <br />And never give us strife,<br />Then we&#8217;re missing out on comfort,<br />In times of deepest pain,<br />We&#8217;re missing out on rainbows,<br />We only see the rain.</p>

<p class="verse">Be thankful for the joys of life,<br />And be thankful for the pain,<br />It is only through the hard times,<br />That some gifts of God we gain.<br />The grace that sees us through each day,<br />Peace only God can give,<br />Patience to endure each trial,<br />A heart willing to forgive.</p>

<p class="verse">So thank you, Lord, for everything,<br />Both happiness and strife,<br />You are the One who holds my hand,<br />And guides me through this life.<br />I will ever love and praise You,<br />For this one truth is sure,<br />You will never, ever leave me,<br />Your love and mercy will endure.</p>

<p>One of my favorite recipes (I really enjoy baking!) is:</p>

<h2>Favorite French Bread</h2>
<p>(What else could the title be?) Place in DLX, Bosch, or large mixing bowl:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>6 c warm water</li>

<li>2 1/2 T. instant yeast</li>

<li>1 T. honey</li>

<li>1/4 c. gluten</li>

<li>1 t. liquid lecithin or 2 t. granules</li>

<li>6 c. wheat flour (I grind our own flour and prefer and recommend using hard white spring wheat)</li>

</ul>
<p>Mix together and let sponge for 15 minutes. Add and mix until well blended:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>1 1/2 T. salt (scant)</li>

<li>And enough flour until it cleans the bowl (about 7 cups)</li>

</ul>
<p>Knead 5-6 minutes in DLX or Bosch, or knead by hand 8-10 minutes. Let rise until double (it doesn&#8217;t take too long). Grease a large area of counter or kitchen table space, and spread and pat out dough into a very large rectangle (a rolling pin is very helpful, although it&#8217;s best not to handle the dough too much). Cut the rectangle in half: I make 4 medium-skinny loaves with one half of the dough, and 2 large, fat loaves with the other half. You can also make bread sticks or sandwich (hoagie) buns. This recipe makes a lot of French bread dough!</p>

<p>Place loaves onto greased cookie sheets and slash each loaf diagonally with a sharp knife. If you&#8217;d like, you can glaze with a beaten egg white and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Let loaves rise for 15-30 minutes. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes (baking for 25 minutes makes a real nice, crusty French bread). Serve hot and enjoy!</p>

<p>As a final note: I like to freeze half of the French bread I make, so as to have bread on hand for another meal on a busy day when I don&#8217;t have time to make bread. Wonderful for busy families!</p>

<h2>In conclusion, is there anytbing else you&#8217;d like to add?</h2>
<p>Martin Luther once said, &#8220;I have held many things in my hands, and have lost them all; but whatever I have placed in God&#8217;s hands, that I still possess.&#8221; This is such an important truth! In the past I have struggled with letting go of something and trust Christ to take care of it and me. When I stubbornly cling to my burdens, or worries, or possessions, all that happens is that I lose my joy, I become sad, depressed, heavy laden with things that my Savior is willing to bear, and I end up with empty hands. On the other hand: when I completely &#8220;turn over&#8221; to God everything I have, which includes the little things (like worrying over a piano lesson) and the big things (like the burden of having a deathly-ill loved one), what freedom, what joy comes!
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+16%3A3">Proverbs 16:3</a> says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Commit thy works unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, and thy thoughts shall be established.&#8221;</span>
I would like to encourage everyone who is reading this interview to trust in the Lord and commit your all to Him.
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+3%3A5-6">Proverbs 3:5-6</a> is well-known and quoted often&#8212;
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Trust in the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.&#8221;</span>&#8212;and maybe sometimes we overlook it because we hear it so often, but trusting in the Lord with all our heart, is very essential! Also <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+37%3A3-7">Psalm 37:3-7</a> is a wonderful &#8220;companion passage&#8221; for the verses we just read: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Trust in the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, and do good&#8230;. Delight thyself also in the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>: and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. Commit thy way unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass&#8230;. Rest in the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, and wait patiently for him.&#8221;</span> He does not lose what you give Him, and there is much joy when you know that everything you have, including yourself, is safe and secure in the hands of Christ!</p>
