<h1><i>Dear Princess Magazine</i></h1>

<p><i>Dear Princess</i> is a quarterly publication for girls of all ages, who are striving to live holy lives and please their Heavenly Father in all areas of their lives.</p>

<p>Abigail Spinks, in the fall of 1996, started <i>Dear Princess</i> with a vision to hold up a higher standard and to encourage girls in pursuing righteousness, growing in grace, and becoming godly young women.</p>

<p>In January 1998, Abigail asked Skye Erickson to join her in the work as co-editor. And now, together, we are striving to glorify God through this ministry that He has placed in our hands.</p>

<p>Through <i>Dear Princess</i>, we wish to have a Bible-based publication, in which we not only want to share about homemaking skills, but what will encourage girls in becoming spiritually prepared for their future homes.</p>

<p>These are the precious days God has given us to learn and prepare for the next stage in life.</p>

<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
<p>Abigail: My family consists of my parents, Mark and Elois, Coquetta Sue (18), and myself, Abigail (14). Daddy and Mama have homeschooled Coquetta and I all our lives, and we are thankful for the Lord giving us godly parents who want to serve the Lord with all their hearts. We live on a small acreage three miles out of the little town of Jefferson. We are grateful for the Lord giving us this place!</p>

<p>Skye: A little over three years ago I came to live with Uncle Rick, Aunt Krista, and my four cousins: Laura (18), Joel (16), Kara (13), and Amanda (5). We live here in the beautiful Willamette Valley, on four acres of land.</p>

<p>Both families are heavily involved in <i>Dear Princess</i> and we appreciate their wisdom and help very much!</p>

<h2>When You Write</h2>
<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+27%3A17" title="Proverbs 27:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 27:17)</span></a></span></p>

<p><i>Dear Princess</i> is written mainly by its readers, and we need your help to encourage others. As readers, you have the opportunity to encourage, challenge, and strengthen your other sisters in becoming more like Christ. Is there a lesson God has been teaching you lately, that you think others would benefit from? Is there a homemaking skill that has been hard for you in the past, but that you&#8217;ve found shortcuts to make the process easier? Has the Lord answered your prayers by helping you to be more patient with your siblings? Please share, and by so doing,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;let us consider one another to provoke [stir up, spur] unto love and to good works.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A24" title="Hebrews 10:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 10:24)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>In future issues, we would like to see more writings from mothers, grandmothers, and older sisters. Please feel free to share with us&#8212;you are very welcome to write in to encourage and teach us younger women.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness&#8230;&#8203;That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+2%3A3-5" title="Titus 2:3-5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Titus 2:3-5)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Again, we can&#8217;t tell you how much each of your letters mean to us&#8212;thank you and please keep writing; they are a great source of encouragement to us. Keep in mind that we consider your letters for print, so please state in your letter if you wish for it not to be printed.</p>

<p>We welcome any comments or suggestions about <i>Dear Princess</i>, so please write if you have any!</p>

<h2>Please Pray</h2>
<p><i>Big</i> is the task of putting out a magazine, even as small a one as this! We&#8217;d appreciate it, as we put this out, that you&#8217;d keep us in your prayers that we will print what is pleasing to the Lord and continue to glorify Him in all we do.</p>

<h2>How to Receive <i>Dear Princess</i></h2>
<p><i>Dear Princess</i> is supported by free-will offerings. We regard this magazine as not our own, but God&#8217;s and He has made it clear to us that He will supply all our needs.</p>

<p>By saying <i>Dear Princess</i> is supported by &#8220;free-will offerings,&#8221; we do not mean a sort of &#8220;pay as you can&#8221; subscription. If the Lord leads you to send in some money to help out with costs, we&#8217;ll gladly accept it. However, you do not need to send in money to receive <i>Dear Princess</i>; if you&#8217;d like to receive <i>Dear Princess</i>, simply write or call and we&#8217;ll put you on the mailing list.</p>

<h2>Why &#8220;Dear Princess&#8221;?</h2>
<p>A couple of our readers have asked this question, so we thought we would just tell you all why.</p>

<p>When the Lord changes our hearts and makes us a new creature, He adopts us into His Royal Family, of which He is the Father. As young ladies, who have experienced this royal birth, we are now princesses, daughters of the King of kings. As princesses of this Kingdom, we need to have our hearts and minds directed to our Home and King. <i>Dear Princess</i> is addressed to you, our dear sisters, as a big packet letter of encouragement coming from other sisters, designed to help encourage you as &#8220;dear princesses.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>We heartily thank each one of you who has contributed to this issue! As we&#8217;ve been finishing all the little things that need to be done, we realize how we&#8217;ve had to squish and squeeze for everything to fit in&#8212;a problem we&#8217;re delighted to have.</p>

<p>We have several &#8220;new&#8221; things about this issue&#8230;. As you&#8217;ll notice, we have quite a few more letters this time. Both Abigail and myself enjoy the letter sections in other magazines, and we thought you would enjoy it, too&#8230;.</p>

<p>There are also 4 additional pages in this issue&#8212;something we&#8217;d like to continue, but that will depend on how many submissions we receive. If you feel led to write, please do so! If you are unsure about the subject, please write and ask!</p>

<p>We continue to pray that each issue of <i>Dear Princess</i> will be a blessing to you and encourage you in godliness and living for the Lord.</p>

<p>&#8212;Skye and Abigail</p>

<p>P.S. We&#8217;re sorry this issue is late.</p>

<p><b>We wanted to mention that since most of our readership writes this magazine, we may not always agree with the doctrines and beliefs expressed by different girls. Please keep this in mind as you read and feel free to write and ask us how we believe.</b></p>

<h1>With Love, from the Editresses</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>The cool stillness that is in the early morning hours wafted over me as I sat weeding in the garden. The humming buzzing sound of a mother humming bird was the only sound that reached my ears&#8212;it was too early for songbirds to begin their singing. The weeds were fairly easy to pull from our soft fluffy dirt letting my mind wander away from the work I was doing&#8230;.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;To glorify Thee, this is my plea.<br />Work out Thy purpose, Thy plan for me.<br />A yielded vessel, Thine own to be,<br />Thy praise and glory to live for Thee.&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_7/editresses_flower.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></div>
<p>The words of the songwriter stuck in my head, bringing back the verses that had so inspired me as I had sung them earlier that morning. &#8220;To glorify Thee, this is my <i>plea</i>.&#8221; My plea? Do I really plead with the Lord to show me ways to glorify Him? The thought struck me as a little strange and perhaps somewhat fanatical for it to be my plea. For often I find myself pleading for healing for my allergies, rather than for grace to bear it, if through the irksomeness of allergies God would be glorified. Thinking along the line of servants, at least good servants, anyway, isn&#8217;t their whole purpose in life &#8220;to glorify&#8221; their masters? If they have put beautiful walks and landscaped a flower garden and basically put out a bunch of hard work, do they get the credit? When their master is entertaining guests in his garden, does he point out that he merely designed it, and really they should be praising his servant? We should think it very ill-mannered indeed if when the master was showing his guest a masterpiece of art, his servant stuck his head in the door and said, &#8220;Hey, I dusted and shined that yesterday; that is why it looks so nice.&#8221; How unglorifying that would be. Yet don&#8217;t we do that? I mean, aren&#8217;t there times when you, too, feel inwardly proud about something, and even if you don&#8217;t say it out loud, subtly you think, &#8220;My, that really touched her. Maybe she&#8217;ll get saved; and it will be because I spoke when the Lord told me to.&#8221; Maybe not that boldly does the devil bring it to you, but perhaps softly, less horridly, and more desirable. Yet we are servants of the Lord, we have given our hearts and lives to Him; what right have we to take any glory upon ourselves? He is our master and we should do all to glorify Him. What an unworthy servant I am, struggling to accept things that He brings to me, when I should be happy and thankful to do whatever would glorify Him. Thinking again of the songwriter&#8217;s words, &#8220;A yielded vessel.&#8221; I am sure this is a different relationship than that of a master who has captured you and held you in bondage. This is one that gives you utter happiness and joy, if you are willing to be a yielded vessel, quiet, lying still and dead, resting in the Master&#8217;s hand. For we must die, before we can live to glorify Him.</p>

<p>Some of this is quite new to me, but I truly want glorifying my Master to be my utmost plea, and I&#8217;m confident that I&#8217;m on the road that leads in that direction.</p>

<p>In closing I&#8217;d like to share the rest of the song that has been on my heart and mind and has inspired me to live so it can be my prayer.</p>

<p class="signature">In His love,<br />Abigail</p>

<h2>To Glorify Thee</h2>
<p class="verse">Oh, may my life be to Thy praise, O Father,<br />In all I do may Thou be magnified,<br />Thou chooseth me before the world&#8217;s foundation,<br />Thine own to be, that Thou be glorified.</p>

<p class="verse">Oh, may my life be to Thy praise, O Spirit,<br />This temple fit, inspired, and yielded be,<br />That in my life I shall glorify Thee,<br />In life or death whate&#8217;er Thou hast for me.</p>

<p class="verse refrain_line">Refrain:</p><p class="verse refrain">To glorify Thee, this is my plea,<br />Work out Thy purpose, Thy plan for me,<br />A Yielded vessel, Thine own to be,<br />Thy promise and glory to live for Thee.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>&#8220;6:30 a.m. Ugh&#8212;I have overslept <i>again</i>&#8230;. No time to have with the Lord before my day begins&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Does this ever happen to you, or am I the only one that struggles to get up every morning to have my quiet time? It is ever so tempting just to want to stay in my nice, cozy bed and doze a little more&#8230;.</p>

<p>Yet all too often I see the results of sleeping in as nothing desirable.</p>

<p>What happens? Prayer and solitude to talk with God changes things. It can drastically change the entire mode and attitude of the day. Almost without fail, I have found that the days when I have overslept and thus not had the time to spend in His Word and in prayer, I struggle more those days.</p>

<p>Why is it that when we don&#8217;t start our day with God first, we invariably don&#8217;t have the special peace and grace that come with spending time with Him?</p>

<p>One dear friend was sharing how she had awakened later than usual and plans hadn&#8217;t gone as she expected one day. Instead she was flustered and not at peace in her heart. Once she was finished with her housework and what needed to be done, she quieted her heart before the Lord and He gave her peace.</p>

<p>Remember Mary and Martha?
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+10%3A41-42" title="Luke 10:41-42"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 10:41-42)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Mary had quieted her heart before the Lord and Martha hadn&#8217;t. All too often I find myself bustling around and making sure the temporal, earthly needs are being met like Martha. Yet Jesus told Martha that the Mary had chosen the better part.</p>

<p>Working with <i>Dear Princess</i> has taught me another aspect of the great importance of prayer and waiting on God for His answers and timing.</p>

<p>When we were at the printer&#8217;s to set up the Summer &#8217;98 issue, the thought occurred that we should buy another stapler so we could get more done in a shorter period. Later that day we picked one up and thought we had made a wise purchase, but, oh, how we were wrong! The wrong part wasn&#8217;t in the actual purchasing of the stapler itself; but in using the Lord&#8217;s money without seeking Him first in prayer. This may seem like a very small thing, but we have a very tight budget.</p>

<p>Time went by and after we had some time to think it all over, we regretted that we hadn&#8217;t prayed about the purchase first. And if we had prayed, would it have been any different?</p>

<p><a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+55%3A8-9">Isaiah 55:8-9</a> comes back to mind:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.&#8221;</span>
</p>

<p>If we had sought the Lord in prayer and asked Him what <i>His</i> thoughts were, we most likely would&#8217;ve found that we weren&#8217;t to purchase the stapler.</p>

<p>Through the intervening months, we have had to use the stapler maybe once or twice. Starting with this next issue, we&#8217;ll have no need for one, as the Lord has provided another printer in Nebraska who will do all the printing, collating, stapling and mailing.</p>

<p>We were thankful when it worked out to take the stapler back, and I was encouraged that
<span class="scripture">&#8220;all things work together for good to them that love God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A28" title="Romans 8:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 8:28)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Such little opportunities can create the groundwork and foundation for the times in life when we really need to pray and wait upon God.</p>

<p>One morning in devotions we read from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+11">John 11</a>
about Lazarus:</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+11%3A5-6" title="John 11:5-6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 11:5-6)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Martha and Mary sent word unto Jesus, imploring Him to come and heal their brother, but it says Jesus abode.</p>

<p>Not always, when we&#8217;re praying, will the Lord come right away and answer our prayers. He abides until the time when He sees that we&#8217;ve gotten the best out of the situation and
<span class="scripture">&#8220;that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+11%3A4" title="John 11:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 11:4)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>As humans, were impatient and want everything to be done quickly and correctly when we think it needs to be done. God&#8217;s ways are higher.</p>

<p>I remember a specific time when I was praying and imploring the Lord for something, and He waited and waited and waited. While I felt God was silent, the fact of the matter was that He was waiting until He knew that I was ready. He saw that I needed to be down on my knees more, to throw out some bad attitudes first, and to be refined by His power though trials. I had more to learn and in order for me to get all the good He had intended, <i>and</i> for Him to be fully glorified, He had to wait.</p>

<p>May we each pray with Amy Carmichael!&#8212;&#8220;Oh to get into that stronger, calmer current, out of the feverishness of human haste. Do please, dear friends, ask that we may exchange the eagerness of the flesh for the earnestness of the Spirit and so move in the force of that Holy Wind that we shall be carried along by His great calm.&#8221; (Taken from <i>A Chance to Die</i>, by Elisabeth Elliot.)</p>

<h1>A Little Peek Behind the Scenes&#8230;&#8203;</h1>

<p>Just briefly, we thought you might be interested in knowing that we took <i>Dear Princess</i> to a home schooling conference in late August.</p>

<p>Neither Abigail or I ever had the slightest thought to go to something like this, but the Lord worked to make it possible and He burdened our hearts to go.</p>

<p>Early in August we were sent an announcement about a home schooling fair near us. Included was another announcement about an upcoming conference in Beaverton (roughly an hour and a half away).</p>

<p>Abigail and I were interested in getting more information about the conference and had the thought of possibly taking <i>Dear Princess</i>. However, we still had to talk with the parents, hear their wisdom and thoughts and likely concerns.</p>

<p>In the meantime, while we were discussing all this, the Spinkses attended the home schooling fair near them. There they talked to the director of the Beaverton conference, asking how much a table would cost and all the details.</p>

<p>One of our concerns about going was the cost. Where would we get all the money to rent a table?</p>

<p>Abigail called and shared how we put <i>Dear Princess</i> out free, and wondered whether we&#8217;d be able just to get a small table versus an 8&#8217; table. The directors said they&#8217;d think it over and let us know. The following day we sent them a copy of <i>Dear Princess</i> and waited&#8230;.</p>

<p>At this point, Abigail and I put a fleece before the Lord. We asked the Lord to provide a table free if it was <i>His</i> will for us to go; we were consecrated to do whatever He saw best.</p>

<p>&#8212;Skye</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>For about two weeks all we heard was a deafening silence, and I, especially, began to have doubts as to whether this idea of taking <i>Dear Princess</i> to a conference was simply Skye&#8217;s and mine, not the Lord&#8217;s. It seemed I could not get rid of the thought, and spent my days placing <i>Dear Princess</i> back in the hands of God (where it belongs), and consecrating the conference and our participation in it to the Lord.</p>

<p>It seemed the devil tried harder than I&#8217;d ever experienced to get me to doubt God&#8217;s sovereignty. Questions like: Why wouldn&#8217;t God not want us to go? Really, I mean, doesn&#8217;t this need to get out to people? God would gently remind, &#8220;Yes, my child, but I am the One who will get it out and in <i>My</i> timing, wait on Me.&#8221;</p>

<p>When I finally learned this seemingly hard lesson, God worked, and on Saturday, August 15, we received a letter telling us that we could have a table for free. God had provided the way and showed us His will clearly, which left us without any doubt, but what now? How many issues to take? Where was the money going to come from to print these issues? While these questions and many more filled us, I was reminded more than once of the scripture,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Except the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> build the house, they labour in vain.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+127%3A1" title="Psalm 127:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 127:1)</span></a></span>
Lord, this is not something we are trying to build up; if this is of You, You will have to &#8220;build&#8221; it. And He did. Looking back, I see so many places where this would not have worked, normally. Money came, other needs were supplied, and it became clear that this was something we were not doing in our own strength. Finally the day arrived for the conference and with a few nervous and fluttering stomachs (&#8220;Ah, what do I say?!&#8221;), we departed. We had the opportunity to meet many new people, quite a few whom we now welcome as subscribers.</p>

<p>The Lord richly blessed&#8212;praise the Lord, His ways are best. Oh, God help us to cease our struggling to see and know and understand. For Your ways are higher than our ways, Your path more precious than ours could ever be.</p>

<p>&#8212;Abigail</p>

<p>Greetings in the precious name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ!
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; But with the <i>precious</i> blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+1%3A18-19" title="I&nbsp;Peter 1:18-19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 1:18-19)</span></a></span>

Skye and Abigail asked me if I would be willing to be interviewed, and I was so surprised! I pray that it will be a blessing to all of you!</p>

<h2>Please tell us about yourself, your interests, goals and values.</h2>
<p>My full name is Amy Adele Zander and I am 17 (my birthday is the 31st of January). I am 5&#8217; tall (and thus find myself looking up at others a lot and getting teased about being short), and have long, curly, dark blackish-brown hair and hazel eyes. My personality is very much like my mother&#8217;s; I am quiet and not real out-going, yet I do enjoy meeting others and spending time in fellowship with like-minded believers. With my family, I live on a very hilly 11-acre farm in western Kentucky where we&#8217;re close to the borders of Missouri, Illinois and Tennessee. My family consists of my father (Chuck), my mother (Mary), and my brothers and sisters, Adam (15), Aaron (12), Austin (10), Arielle (6), and Arianna (3), and we have two blessings in Heaven.</p>

<p>My family and I go to a tiny, very conservative independent, King James Bible-believing, Fundamental Baptists church (consisting of 3 families) in Tennessee, that is almost an hour&#8217;s drive away. For a long time we couldn&#8217;t find a like-minded church, and we homechurched for a while by ourselves, and then after 2 years of &#8220;being by ourselves&#8221;, God led us to our current church, The Old Paths Baptist Church (named after
the verse in Jeremiah about returning to the old paths returning to the old paths [<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+6%3A16">Jeremiah 6:16</a>]).
We&#8217;re very thankful for our church family!</p>

<p>Our family is involved in two ministries with our church, collating King James Bibles and tracts, and painting banners for street preaching. We put together Bibles and tracts that get distributed all over the world to the pastors, missionaries, and people who need them, and we do this as a ministry, not a business (we don&#8217;t sell anything). We just sent off 7 boxes of John and Romans Bibles to England. It is a blessing to be able to put together Bibles that will be used and read by those who receive them. I pray many times over the Bibles, as we work together collating them; wouldn&#8217;t it be wonderful if at least one person came to know the Lord as their Savior through these little Bibles?! About the banners: we paint a colorful, vivid scene of Heaven and hell, or Christ knocking on a man&#8217;s door, or of the cross, or of the great, white throne judgement (using the drawings of Dr. Peter S. Ruckman for our patterns) on a big 4&#8217;x 6&#8217; banners. Each banner has appropriate Scripture(s) to match with each picture, and you&#8217;re able to lift these banners high into the air, as they&#8217;re attached to long rods. Preachers use them on the street, when street preaching, and every banner gets a lot of attention and generates many questions from those on the street. We as a church use them a lot; it is a very effective way to get the Gospel out!</p>

<p>I have many interests! One of my biggest interests is writing. I thoroughly enjoy writing, and moreover, my family and I believe that God&#8217;s Will for my life includes writing articles to encourage and help others to live for the Lord and serve Him. The Lord has given me a ministry through writing and I am so thankful for His help, guidance and wisdom! I also would like to write and publish children&#8217;s books; I am currently working on outlines for several stories. My two sisters provide much inspiration for me!</p>

<p>Other interests include sewing (in which I am ever learning, if somewhat slowly!), cross-stitching, playing the piano (I enjoy playing hymns that bring glory to God, and music is one way that I am able to praise Him!), gardening, and baking. Baking is one of my most favorite &#8220;pastimes&#8221; and it brings great pleasure to me to bake for my family healthy, homemade breads, cookies, cakes, and more, all from freshly ground grains that we&#8217;re able to grind ourselves.</p>

<p>Goals for the future? Always I have the goal of being more like Christ, my dear Savior, more like Him in action, word, and deed. I desire to be pleasing to the Lord:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, 0 Lord, my strength, and my redeemer.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+19%3A14" title="Psalm 19:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 19:14)</span></a></span>
Also, I desire to be the servant of the Lord that He wants me to be. And to me, being a servant of Jesus includes ministering to my family in daily life&#8212;I spend most (99%) with my family and I strive to be pleasing to the Lord through being a godly, obedient, sweet, modest, gentle daughter, sister, and friend. My desire is to one day be an help-meet, wife, mother, and homemaker, and my family and I believe that if it is God&#8217;s Will for me to be married someday, that He will bring my future husband and I together via Biblical courtship and betrothal.</p>

<h2>Please tell us about your family.</h2>
<p>My father (Chuck) works as a front-line manager at a gas diffusion plant that enriches uranium. He was in the Marine Corps for 10 years and then was a contractor at nuclear plants for 11 years, and Dad&#8217;s job, until recently, has moved us around a lot! We&#8217;ve been all over the United States and have stayed in everything from hotels to rental houses, campgrounds to mobile homes, travel trailers to tents! My father is a very friendly, outgoing man, with a heart for lost souls and a desire to follow the Lord wherever He leads him. Dad is attending a small Bible Institute and preparing for the ministry, as God has called him to start a church and be a pastor. Also we believe that God has called our family into the ministry of encouraging and helping other families be faithful, walk the narrow way, and live for Christ. My father is a very special man, and I am very blessed to be his daughter!</p>

<p>My mother (Mary) is the sweetest and godliest woman I know! I do not have to look beyond my family for a <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+2">Titus 2</a> role model, I have one right in my family&#8212;my dear mother! Mom is a gentle, quiet person with a compassionate heart and a willing ear to someone who needs to talk. We enjoy cooking together, talking about homeschooling, and sharing thoughts on what we read in our Bibles each morning. When Mom lost baby Judah, I was really scared for her, and seeing her complete faith and trust in God helped me not to be fearful. <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+27%3A1">Psalm 27:1</a> says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;The L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?&#8221;</span>
Truly the Lord is my light, my salvation, and the strength of my life and I have no need to be afraid! What a wonderful example my mother is to me about trusting God.</p>

<p>Adam is 15 years old, and we are very close. Adam is a lover of music and would play every instrument available if he could! He plays the classical guitar, as well as piano (we take piano lessons together). We encourage and help each other with our music. Adam is a young man who is steadfast in the convictions that God has shown us through His Word, and he has a tender heart, which is sensitive to spiritual matters. He also has a hard time saying no to his younger sisters when they ask him to read a story to them.</p>

<p>Time to introduce Aaron (age 12)! This is my quiet and reserved brother who thinks much and talks little&#8230;&#8203;but when he speaks it is worth listening to him! Aaron isn&#8217;t always reserved though; when he was a baby he was all &#8220;smiles and sunshine,&#8221; and now he is our cheerful one who knows how to make everyone laugh (without hurting someone&#8217;s feelings or making fun of someone) and smile. He is an outdoor man, very energetic, and I don&#8217;t think there is a lazy bone in Aaron! Aaron, like Adam, is also a godly young man who is strong in the faith and in God&#8217;s Word.</p>

<p>At 11, Austin is my youngest brother and he&#8217;s the mischievous one! Teasing his sisters and eating cookies as fast as I can bake them are two of his &#8220;favorite&#8221; things to do. For all his teasing, Austin has a real sweet side to him, and often he&#8217;ll surprise me by doing something special like washing the dishes for me (when it&#8217;s my turn) without saying anything. Austin is quickly growing and will soon be taller than myself just as the other boys are, and he can&#8217;t wait for that moment when he is taller than me! He, just like his other brothers, loves the Lord and is not ashamed of his Savior&#8212;his willingness to witness and his boldness amazes me!</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_7/never_reading.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="130" /></div>
<p>Now comes one of the dearest parts of my family&#8230;&#8203;Arielle (6) Arianna (3)! My sisters and I share a room together (just as the boys share a room together), and we&#8217;re very close. It doesn&#8217;t matter that I am 17 years old and they are 6 and 3, we&#8217;re best friends! (Actually every one of my family members are my best friends!) Arielle and Arianna love to help me bake and are excited that they&#8217;re going to help me with gardening this year! A very advanced reader for her age, Arielle enjoys reading her Bible (she&#8217;s reading through the Psalms right now, and is memorizing <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+121">Psalm 121</a> and <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+113">Psalm 113</a>),
Pathway readers, Jewel books, and as many books as she can get her hands on! Sometimes, instead of my reading the girls a bedtime story (we always try to read a book or two&#8230;&#8203;or three&#8230;&#8203;or four together every day), I have Arielle read Arianna and me a bedtime story!</p>

<p>Arianna is a very cute, very active, very lovable little sister. She is full of giggles, hugs and kisses, and enjoys singing hymns while she plays with her baby dolls and blocks (and she knows many hymns by heart&#8230;&#8203;probably because there is always someone who is either singing or playing favorite family hymns on an instrument). Many times, when Arianna causes me to smile and laugh, I thank the Lord that she is still with us. We almost lost her when she was a little baby, and I am very thankful we still have Arianna.</p>

<h2>Is there any special blessing from the Lord you&#8217;d like to share?</h2>
<p>When we lost our much-loved and much-anticipated baby boy a few months ago, and a grandmother right after, God was very good to us and was our comfort and joy. I received such a special blessing from the Lord then, although my heart was greatly heavy and with pain and sorrow, He enabled me to have joy in the midst of this circumstance. <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+18%3A28-36">Psalm 18:28-36</a> says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;For thou wilt light my candle: the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> my God will enlighten my darkness.For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall. As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him. For who is God save the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>? or who is a rock save our God? It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect. He maketh my feet like hinds&#8217; feet, and setteth me upon my high places. He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great. Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.&#8221;</span>
Jesus was, and still is, so faithful to me, and I was brought to the place where my own strength was gone and was nothing. I had to completely depend on my Savior and His strength&#8212;resting wholly and entirely on Jesus Christ is one of the most restful and wisest things a Christian can do! I received a wonderful blessing from the valley my family and I had trod. Christ strengthened me through His Word and greatly used <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+28%3A6-7">Psalm 28:6-7</a>, which became my main two verses during this hard time:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Blessed be the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications. The L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.&#8221;</span>
We named our baby Judab, which means &#8220;Praise,&#8221; and &#8220;I will praise the Lord,&#8221; because God helped us praise Him. Blessed is the Lord, because He did hear my voice when I cried to Him! He is my strength and my shield (my protection!), and my heart trusted in Him, I was helped, and my heart rejoices! The Lord is so good to His children!</p>

<h2>Would you mind sharing a favorite book, poem or recipe?</h2>
<p>May I share a favorite poem and recipe?</p>

<p>A poem that I found in a little booklet really caught my attention. It speaks of praising the Lord during all times, both in joyful days and in the sorrowful days, and I am reminded of <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+34%3A1">Psalm 34, verse 1</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8220;I will bless the Lord at all times: his praise shall be continually in my mouth.&#8221;</span></p>

<h2>Praise the Lord</h2>
<p class="author">Linda Dallis</p>

<p class="verse">If we only praise the Lord,<br />For all the things in life<br />That fill our hearts with laughter, <br />And never give us strife,<br />Then we&#8217;re missing out on comfort,<br />In times of deepest pain,<br />We&#8217;re missing out on rainbows,<br />We only see the rain.</p>

<p class="verse">Be thankful for the joys of life,<br />And be thankful for the pain,<br />It is only through the hard times,<br />That some gifts of God we gain.<br />The grace that sees us through each day,<br />Peace only God can give,<br />Patience to endure each trial,<br />A heart willing to forgive.</p>

<p class="verse">So thank you, Lord, for everything,<br />Both happiness and strife,<br />You are the One who holds my hand,<br />And guides me through this life.<br />I will ever love and praise You,<br />For this one truth is sure,<br />You will never, ever leave me,<br />Your love and mercy will endure.</p>

<p>One of my favorite recipes (I really enjoy baking!) is:</p>

<h2>Favorite French Bread</h2>
<p>(What else could the title be?) Place in DLX, Bosch, or large mixing bowl:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>6 c warm water</li>

<li>2 1/2 T. instant yeast</li>

<li>1 T. honey</li>

<li>1/4 c. gluten</li>

<li>1 t. liquid lecithin or 2 t. granules</li>

<li>6 c. wheat flour (I grind our own flour and prefer and recommend using hard white spring wheat)</li>

</ul>
<p>Mix together and let sponge for 15 minutes. Add and mix until well blended:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>1 1/2 T. salt (scant)</li>

<li>And enough flour until it cleans the bowl (about 7 cups)</li>

</ul>
<p>Knead 5-6 minutes in DLX or Bosch, or knead by hand 8-10 minutes. Let rise until double (it doesn&#8217;t take too long). Grease a large area of counter or kitchen table space, and spread and pat out dough into a very large rectangle (a rolling pin is very helpful, although it&#8217;s best not to handle the dough too much). Cut the rectangle in half: I make 4 medium-skinny loaves with one half of the dough, and 2 large, fat loaves with the other half. You can also make bread sticks or sandwich (hoagie) buns. This recipe makes a lot of French bread dough!</p>

<p>Place loaves onto greased cookie sheets and slash each loaf diagonally with a sharp knife. If you&#8217;d like, you can glaze with a beaten egg white and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Let loaves rise for 15-30 minutes. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes (baking for 25 minutes makes a real nice, crusty French bread). Serve hot and enjoy!</p>

<p>As a final note: I like to freeze half of the French bread I make, so as to have bread on hand for another meal on a busy day when I don&#8217;t have time to make bread. Wonderful for busy families!</p>

<h2>In conclusion, is there anytbing else you&#8217;d like to add?</h2>
<p>Martin Luther once said, &#8220;I have held many things in my hands, and have lost them all; but whatever I have placed in God&#8217;s hands, that I still possess.&#8221; This is such an important truth! In the past I have struggled with letting go of something and trust Christ to take care of it and me. When I stubbornly cling to my burdens, or worries, or possessions, all that happens is that I lose my joy, I become sad, depressed, heavy laden with things that my Savior is willing to bear, and I end up with empty hands. On the other hand: when I completely &#8220;turn over&#8221; to God everything I have, which includes the little things (like worrying over a piano lesson) and the big things (like the burden of having a deathly-ill loved one), what freedom, what joy comes!
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+16%3A3">Proverbs 16:3</a> says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Commit thy works unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, and thy thoughts shall be established.&#8221;</span>
I would like to encourage everyone who is reading this interview to trust in the Lord and commit your all to Him.
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+3%3A5-6">Proverbs 3:5-6</a> is well-known and quoted often&#8212;
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Trust in the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.&#8221;</span>&#8212;and maybe sometimes we overlook it because we hear it so often, but trusting in the Lord with all our heart, is very essential! Also <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+37%3A3-7">Psalm 37:3-7</a> is a wonderful &#8220;companion passage&#8221; for the verses we just read: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Trust in the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, and do good&#8230;. Delight thyself also in the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>: and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. Commit thy way unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass&#8230;. Rest in the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, and wait patiently for him.&#8221;</span> He does not lose what you give Him, and there is much joy when you know that everything you have, including yourself, is safe and secure in the hands of Christ!</p>

<h2>Nothing but the Best</h2>
<p>Greetings in Jesus Name from Montezuma! I hope this letter finds you growing
<span class="scripture">&#8220;in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+3%3A18" title="II&nbsp;Peter 3:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 3:18)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Yesterday, Bethany stepped on a harmless-looking pile of ashes, but hot coals were undemeath! She screamed and cried for a while, but we finally soothed the bums on her feet by soaking them in cold water for hours. She seemed better toward the evening until Dad put aloe-vera gel on her burns. (The doctor had told us to do so.) She was crying hysterically because of the pain and Dad was afraid she&#8217;d go into shock from staying in cold water for so long. We were all trying to find a way to sooth her by asking her what she wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beth, do you want some juice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You want your doll?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Want me to read you a book?&#8221;</p>

<p>She ended all this by saying (or sobbing out), &#8220;I just want to be healed!&#8221;</p>

<p>So we <i>prayed</i>! We also called some friends to pray. And, almost suddenly, she calmed down and the pain stopped. She was ecstatic and we were so thankful! The next day she was walking fine. Praise the Lord!</p>

<p>Yesterday I was happily surprised to see <i>Dear Princess</i> (<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6">the Summer issue</a>) in the mail! I <i>really</i> enjoyed it and was encouraged and strengthened by quite a few articles especially! Thanks <i>so</i> much, Skye, for sending it to me! I read the child&#8217;s story &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Penny_Plays_Rabbit/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Penny Plays Rabbit">Penny Plays Rabbit</a>&#8221; to Bethany, and then Bethany enjoyed it a second time when I read it to her and Noah! They both really liked it, and so did I! I think &#8220;Stitches &#8217;N&#8217; Stories&#8221; is a wonderful addition to <i>Dear Princess</i>! Laura&#8217;s illustrations for &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/True_Love/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/True Love">True Love</a>&#8221; were <i>darling</i> and beautiful!

When we just focus on ourselves, what opportunities to reach out are missed! &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Pikas_Treasure_What_About_Mine/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Pika's Treasure&#8212;What About Mine?">Pika&#8217;s Treasure&#8212;What About Mine?</a>&#8221; was <i>so</i> good! I really appreciate Lisa sharing ways in which Jesus&#8217; Words have kept her from sinning.</p>

<p>One thought that seems to instantly stomp out the devil&#8217;s fires of discontent or wishful dreaming in my heart, is this: God (the Maker of the universe, Master Designer, King of Creation, my Merciful Redeemer and Unfailing Friend Who wants <i>nothing but the best for me</i>!) <b>has a perfect plan fit my life</b>! Praise the Lord! When I really dwell on that glorious truth&#8212;I get so excited! My &#8220;running ahead of God&#8217;s plan&#8221; immediately stops. My heart is then at rest (no more fear of the future!) when I realize that the safest place to be is in the will of God! May we always <i>stay in His will</i>! (I don&#8217;t want to imply the untruth that it&#8217;s so easy for me to surrender to God&#8217;s will and plan, my heart only thrills to this thought when I dwell on it with an open heart!)</p>

<p>Another thing that is so comforting to me is to realize that whenever we fall, the Lord wants us to run back to Him, wash in the blood of Jesus and re-surrender ourselves to Him&#8212;immediately! So many times I feel like I have to linger, like the Prodigal Son, for a while before I &#8220;arise and go unto my Father&#8221;&#8212;but I was so glad to find that this was wrong. How would you feel if Amanda did something wrong to you and when you were wanting so truly to forgive her and embrace her, she stayed miserably in the shadows? I love this sentence: &#8220;The greatest wrong we can do to Love is to stay away&#8221;&#8212;Amy Carmichael.</p>

<h2>No Reputation But Christ&#8217;s</h2>
<p>I recently received my first issue of <i>Dear Princess</i> and I really enjoyed it! I love &#8220;finding&#8221; magazines that help and encourage me in my daily walk, and show me that there are many others who are different from the world and who desire to follow and serve our mighty Savior &#8220;with all their hearts&#8221;! Thank you, Skye, for sharing about this magazine with me! I would like to continue to receive <i>DP</i>, and whenever possible, I&#8217;d like to have <i>all</i> the back issues, please. I greatly look forward to getting them and the next issue of <i>DP</i>!</p>

<p>There were many things about <i>DP</i> which I enjoyed (okay, I&#8217;ll be honest&#8212;Ienjoyed all of it!) I found &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Seek_Him_Early/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Seek Him Early">Seek Him Early</a>&#8221; by E. M. Bounds to be a needed challenge to rise earlier and make my time with Him more precious! &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Pikas_Treasure_What_About_Mine/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Pika's Treasure&#8212;What About Mine?">Pika&#8217;s Treasure&#8212;What About Mine?</a>&#8221; by Lisa J. Panasuk was also convicting, especially since patience and cheerfulness are two of the things I usually struggle with daily. Sylvia Kembel&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Throw_Out_the_Lifeline/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Throw Out the Lifeline">Throw Out the Lifeline</a>&#8221; was very good, for it seems to me that family members are the hardest to witness to. How easy it is to worry too much about others&#8217; opinion of us (especially family) instead of what our Father in Heaven wants us to do and what He thinks of us! Your article, Sylvia, was a good reminder that (as you said), &#8220;we have no reputation to lose as our reputation is Christ&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Laura Erickson&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/The_Colors_of_Our_Country/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/The Colors of Our Country">The Colors of Our Country</a>,&#8221; and Hannah L. Clayton&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/True_Love/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/True Love">True Love</a>&#8221; were excellent studies of <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+3%3A12-14">Colossians 3:12-14</a> and <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+13%3A4-8">I&nbsp;Corinthians 13:4-8</a>, respectively. How terribly I fall short of truly loving others as Christ does! Ladies, your articles were eye-openers, and much needed by me. Only with our Redeemer&#8217;s triumphant help can we ever even hope to develop these precious qualities and attitudes.</p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/The_Gift_of_Conversation/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/The Gift of Conversation">The Gift of Conversation</a>&#8221; really has shown me the importance of being hospitable and friendly to others, and Skye, your article, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Forgetting_and_Reaching_Forth/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Forgetting and Reaching Forth">Forgetting and Reaching Forth</a>&#8221; didn&#8217;t go unnoticed or unappreciated either! I often struggle with doing just as the title said, so your words were very encouraging! I was also helped by what you said, Abigail, for it&#8217;s easy to get overwhelmed by trials, whether big or small, and often feel we must do something about it when we only need to keep our eyes on Jesus and give it all to Him!</p>

<p>As with my other magazines, I also loved the reader interview and the letters from fellow sisters in Christ, and even found &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Penny_Plays_Rabbit/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Penny Plays Rabbit">Penny Plays Rabbit</a>&#8221; cute and amusing.</p>

<p>Thank you, Abigail and Skye, for following the Lord&#8217;s leading and publishing this magazine! It is appreciated! I&#8217;ll keep you in my prayers. God bless!</p>

<h2>So Very Important</h2>
<p>Thank you so much for adding me on your mailing list! I just received the Summer &#8217;98 issue, and enjoyed it a lot. &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Pikas_Treasure_What_About_Mine/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Pika's Treasure&#8212;What About Mine?">Pika&#8217;s Treasure&#8212;What About Mine?</a>&#8221; by Lisa J. Panasuk was wonderful! I read it over several times, and each time made a deeper impression on me&#8212;sometimes it&#8217;s so easy to neglect spending time in prayer and Bible study, yet it is so <i>very</i> important! Thank you, Lisa, I need that!</p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/True_Love/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/True Love">True Love</a>,&#8221; by Hannah L. Clayton really hit hard, too, and got me <i>really</i> thinking! Every word was very true and prompted me to examine my own attitude and feelings. The illustrations were great, too, Laura&#8212;I enjoyed looking at them.</p>

<p>I could comment on each article and story, but I suppose it would take too long! Instead, let me say I loved reading <i>Dear Princess</i> from cover to cover and look forward to the next issue!</p>

<p>May God bless you as you continue in His plan!</p>

<h2>A Prayer List</h2>
<p>As I was reading the <a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6">Summer 1998 issue</a> of <i>DP</i>, I came across &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Seek_Him_Early/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Seek Him Early">Seek Him Early</a>&#8221; by E. M. Bounds. And while reading a thought came to me, &#8220;Why not make a list of God&#8217;s blessings, prayer needs and other things and pray about them the next morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Throw_Out_the_Lifeline/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Throw Out the Lifeline">Throw Out the Lifeline</a>,&#8221; by Sylvia Grace Kembel, was an encouragement, since my mom&#8217;s mom and dad are not saved. Thank you, Sylvia, for your encouraging to keep on praying for my unsaved family!</p>

<p><i>DP</i> is <i>so</i> encouraging; keep up the good work, Abigail and Skye!</p>

<h2>All-Seeing, All-Knowing</h2>
<p>Praise the Lord for how He guarded you from the wrong printer! He truly is our protector. I read your article, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Forgetting_and_Reaching_Forth/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Forgetting and Reaching Forth">Forgetting and Reaching Forth</a>,&#8221; in this current issue of <i>Dear Princess</i>. The part about &#8220;I find myself easily doubting about getting married, as there are no possible options around, yet doesn&#8217;t God know?&#8221; I could easily identify with. Sometimes I wonder&#8230;&#8203;but God does know. Just recently a friend of mine began courting, and another became engaged after courting. Hearing their stories reminds me that there is a God Who sees&#8212;El Roi. In one case, the young man had noticed this girl for six years and yet she had no idea that he was interested in her. I was so impressed by what her sister said: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think there was anyone this perfect for Sarah.&#8221; So God knows, and He will get the nght one to the right place at the right time. But pray for me that I will actually live with this faith&#8230;&#8203;</p>

<div class="blurb">
<p class="first">Note: Many of you probably don&#8217;t know what Jennifer is talking about in the first part of her letter.</p>

<p>Several months back, when we were looking into different printing possibilities, we found a man who would be willing to do offset printing for a real cheap price. We then made plans to take <i>DP</i> there&#8230;&#8203;without really consulting the Lord first. We were excited and trusted this man that what he said was truthful. However, we soon found out that we were wrong.</p>

<p>Upon finishing the last stages of the Summer issue, we decided we&#8217;d just go ahead and send our masters through the mail. However, Mr. Spinks didn&#8217;t think that a wise idea and announced that he would take it for us&#8230;.</p>

<p>When he arrived back home, we had some shocking news. Not only was this man a fraud who didn&#8217;t have anything in the way of equipment for printing but he was also going to take it somewhere else and later charge us more than double what he first quoted us.</p>

<p>We praise the Lord for His mercy to us in helping us to discover this <i>before</i> it happened&#8230;. He has provided us with another printer in Nebraska, and we&#8217;re thankful for this lesson!</p>

<h2>As Strangers and Pilgrims</h2>
<p>Thank you for printing <i>Dear Princess</i>. I found this issue so encouraging&#8212;both yours and Abigail&#8217;s articles were so good. &#8220;Forgetting the past.&#8221; Hmmm&#8230;&#8203;something extremely difficult to do. I am glad you are writing about it, as I often need to be reminded of that!</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m glad I &#8220;met&#8221; you and Abigail! And I am <i>very</i> thankful for <i>HC</i> and <i>DP</i>. They often come right when I need them the most. I am also very thankful God has given us His Word, good books to read, fellowship with godly families (through the mail for now), and excellent magazines!</p>

<p>I suppose you are wondering who I am, my family etc&#8230;.</p>

<p>I was born in Oregon in 1984 and lived near Eugene with my parents until I was 8. We then moved to Oklahoma and lived there for three years. I did not like living in OK because I was afraid of the storms and tornadoes. God was very gracious for protecting us while we lived there. Then in spring of &#8217;95 my nana was diagnosed with cancer, and so we moved out here to care for her and Grandpa. In the fall of that year Nana finally, after years of prayer, accepted Jesus as her Lord and personal Savior. She died in &#8217;96, and now we are taking care of my grandpa. He is not open to Jesus, but we are praying for him.</p>

<p>We are living in an apartment right now, in the middle of the city, in southern California. I live with my Daddy (Mark), Mom (Ann), and one sister (Hope), who&#8217;s 9. I enjoy reading my Bible and other Godly books, cooking, baking, making stationary, cross-stitching, playing with stuffed bears with Hope, and more.</p>

<p>We dress modestly&#8212;I wear below-the-knee dresses, jumpers, skirts, and split-skirts all the time. We read mostly the King James Version of the Bible and believe in courtship (saving one&#8217;s heart for her future husband). Hope and I have been homeschooled our whole lives and are thankful for it. Mom is a keeper at home, and is teaching Hope and me to follow Jesus, to be submissive to our dad, and other &#8220;keeper at home&#8221; things. Daddy is a great father! He teaches all of us so much. He likes to communicate and talk things out, joke, make us laugh, lift people up, and tell people about Jesus&#8212;how Jesus changed his life and how He can change theirs. Daddy doesn&#8217;t have a job right now. He is studying in computers, and we are praying God will provide him with a pleasant job afterwards. We don&#8217;t &#8220;fit in&#8221; here at all! I&#8217;m glad that we don&#8217;t, but I wish the people here weren&#8217;t worldly. God has and is really calling us away from the world to peace and a quiet lifestyle. We don&#8217;t have TV, don&#8217;t go shopping, don&#8217;t go to the beach, don&#8217;t go to movies, don&#8217;t believe in dating, etc. I am glad we are being called away&#8212;I wouldn&#8217;t want to &#8220;fit in&#8221; here.</p>

<p>I need to be going now&#8230;&#8203;I&#8217;d love to hear from you when you can write, but no hurry.</p>

<h2>Forgetting and Reaching Forth</h2>
<p>How can we tell you or thank you for sending <i>Dear Princess</i> to us?! We <b>absolutely loved it</b> because of the deep spiritual content! Please do keep us on your mailing list. We would like to donate, but don&#8217;t have any personal money at the moment. We hope to send something soon. We also appreciated your desire to &#8220;freely give.&#8221; What a blessing! The Lord has also laid it on our hearts to offer <i>YWSH</i> totally free, starting with this next issue.</p>

<p>How I could relate to your article on &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Forgetting_and_Reaching_Forth/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Forgetting and Reaching Forth">Forgetting and Reaching Forth</a>&#8221; in <i>Dear Princess</i>. That is what I keep having to remind myself. &#8220;Don&#8217;t look back, Melody! Look forward. God has a perfect plan for your life. <b>Just trust Him</b>! You can&#8217;t see the complete picture now, but it really <i>is</i> true.&#8221; In the past, I&#8217;ve found myself looking back, and I know that it caused discontentment with where God had placed me at that time. I don&#8217;t want that to be the case.</p>

<h2>Grace Bigger than Our Problems</h2>
<p>Thank you so much for printing such a wonderful magazine! It is so encouraging to hear what God is doing in other young ladies&#8217; lives. I searched for years to find a magazine for young people whose goal was to help us learn to be more like Christ. Discouraged by my findings (sometimes to the point of being repulsed!), I had nearly give up finding a truly God-centered, uplifting, wholesome magazine. Then, thank God, I met Abigail at OMSI!</p>

<p>There were so many things in this latest issue that spoke to my heart, but I will just mention two that especially encouraged me. The first one was your article, Abigail, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/With_Love_from_the_Editress/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/With Love, from the Editress">With Love, from the Editress</a>.&#8221; I have been extremely depressed lately, but I am not certain I know what was causing it. I have naturally been a little stressed on occasion, but this was abnormally severe. It stretched on day after day, week after week, until I thought I couldn&#8217;t take anymore. I felt like I had a black cloud pushing me down and smothering me. But God&#8217;s grace is much bigger than our problems! Your article was so encouraging to me! (Only God knows how much!) Thank you, Abigail.</p>

<p>The other things that encouraged me was the article by Skye. I especially noticed one paragraph in which she mentioned she sometimes doubted she would get married, as there are no possible options around. I, too, have that problem. No, I shouldn&#8217;t call it a problem, because in His time, if it is His will, He will lead me to the right young man. It was encouraging to read Skye&#8217;s thoughts on this subject. Thank you!</p>

<p>Thank you both, once again, for this wonderful magazine! May God bless you as you follow His leading in your lives!</p>

<p class="signature">In His love,<br />Ruby Johnson<br />Bend, OR</p>

<p>P.S. Might I suggest a corner in <i>DP</i> for a recommended book list? Those of us who are avid bookworms would greatly appreciate the opportunity to share book titles. It is getting increasing harder to find Godly, wholesome books!</p>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">Note: We&#8217;d be more than happy to add this new feature, however, we need your hek in supplying book reviews for it. If there is any good book that you have eipedal!y enjoyed, please share it with the rest of us!</p>

<h2>More Precious than Silver or Gold</h2>
<p>We (my two sisters and I) received our sample issue of <i>Dear Princess</i>. We really enjoyed it! It&#8217;s so encouraging to see what the Lord is doing. I can certainly see there are the &#8220;seven thousand&#8221; who are seeking to be faithful to the Lord. I believe that we are in the last days and that God&#8217;s people need to encourage each other and build each other up in Bible faith and in obedience to all of God&#8217;s loving requirements.</p>

<p>I sure could relate to Abigail&#8217;s feelings expressed in the editorial, as I have suffered with depression off and on and sometimes don&#8217;t know the cause. Usually, though, if I really search I can find several contributing factors. If I can identify the sources of the sadness, anxiety or resentment, regret&#8212;then I can face that and say, &#8220;It&#8217;s not so bad, especially with the Lord taking care of it,&#8221; and can
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Commit [my] way unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>; trust also in him,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+37%3A5" title="Psalm 37:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 37:5)</span></a></span>
and He will act, as the Psalmist said. Talking faith&#8212;I should do that more. God will not let bad things happen to me while I&#8217;m truly seeking to do what is His will&#8212;unless those bad things are actually for my good. Then He will help me through them, if I stay with Him. Other remedies for anxiety and depression include: singing hymns, prayer, reading <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalms">Psalms</a>, <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah">Isaiah</a>, and other encouraging, uplifting Bible passages, and seeking out someone else to help and encourage and witness to them. Talking of the Savior&#8217;s love, and seeking to enumerate and magnify His charms lifts our hearts and fills us with the Holy Spirit and takes the mind off of self and onto holy, lively, thankful themes.</p>

<p>My favorite article was &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Seek_Him_Early/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Seek Him Early">Seek Him Early</a>.&#8221; It was so true! I always feel I shouldn&#8217;t do studies or read the newspaper, if I haven&#8217;t yet taken time for personal Bible reading. Prayer before meeting and talking with others really makes the difference too. I also liked the picture with it&#8212;outdoors. Even when I lived in the city, I would go out under the stars and ponder God&#8217;s many promises. I recalled how God told Abraham to see the stars and try to number them adding,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;So shall thy seed be.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+15%3A5" title="Genesis 15:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 15:5)</span></a></span>
Another:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+40%3A26" title="Isaiah 40:26"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 40:26)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+19%3A1" title="Psalm 19:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 19:1)</span></a></span>
I feel like exclaiming with the prophet,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Habakkuk+3%3A3" title="Habakkuk 3:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Habakkuk 3:3)</span></a></span>
I feel happy; His love seems real to me; faith and energy spring up anew in my heart, I feel loved and ready to love and to serve in His strength. Nothing I see with my natural eyes are as lasting as the stars or so far out in space. But they are meaningful on/v because seeing them I naturally think of God, who lives on high. Abe Lincoln said he did not know how anyone could look up at the sky and deny the existence of God. Other natural things that really impress me are birds, flowers, and trees.</p>

<p>I also liked the <a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Laying_All_at_His_Feet/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Laying All at His Feet">interview with Angela LeFevre</a>. Thank you, Angela, for sharing with us! Your story touched my heart because I have long had the dream of adopting older children who need a good home and to learn about Jesus right away. Children are precious souls (we should think of everyone that way) and they grow up so fast! Jesus said, &#8220;Let the little children come to me&#8221; (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+10%3A14">Mark 10:14</a>)&#8212;and let their parents come too! If I do marry (if that be the Lord&#8217;s will) I want to consider adoption, as a ministry. Our Heavenly Father has adopted us at a price much more precious than silver or gold&#8212;and building that saving relationship with Him takes time, just as it takes time for the adopted ones to actually feel like family. It must be truly enriching.</p>

<p>I also liked the sharings from Lisa Panasuk, Hannah Clayton, and Sylvia Kembel. I have at times felt the urge to write to someone whom our family has been out of touch for some time, because some Scripture popped out of the page as I was reading and reminded me of that person. Then other kindred verses started coming to mind. I just felt impressed I had to write! Praying about it, I would get out my Bible and paper and pen and write an anonymous letter, leaving off the return address, leaving the Spirit of the Lord to make the impression. Then I could still address the reader personally and wish him/her God&#8217;s special blessing.</p>

<p>I read &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/The_Gift_of_Conversation/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/The Gift of Conversation">The Gift of Conversation</a>&#8221; with intense interest. How my heart felt for the one who wrote it! Perhaps she recently moved to a new place. I can truly sympathize. But let me tell you, I might also speak up on behalf of the short-winded girls. Some people are sensitive and shy because of family or personal troubles. Some have few friends or little time allotted to visit, so they feel overwhelmed when they get together with others, especially with the outgoing type. I&#8217;ve been in those situations. I surely hope I have never impressed someone as being unfriendly or uninterested, though.</p>

<p>Speech is a talent; influence is a talent. So, what about it? Are we using these to encourage and welcome each other to Christ?
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Talk ye of all his wondrous works&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+105%3A2" title="Psalm 105:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 105:2)</span></a></span>!
the Psalmist says&#8230;.</p>

<p>I also could really relate to Skye&#8217;s article, &#8220;Forgetting and Reaching Forth,&#8221; as much of our extended family doesn&#8217;t get along with us because of our faith and &#8220;odd&#8221; practices like homeschooling. As we near the close of time as we know it, truth and error become more distinct from each other as the Great controversy between Christ and Satan becomes more intense. Yet the enemy will seek to deceive even the elect.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;[S]he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+24%3A13" title="Matthew 24:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 24:13)</span></a></span>

<p>May the Lord richly bless you.</p>

<h2>Something I Didn&#8217;t Have</h2>
<p>I am a wife of sevens years and a mother of two beautiful boys. I picked up your <a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6">summer edition</a> of <i>Dear Princess</i> at the Homeschool Conference in Beaverton, OR, on August 28, 1998. I picked it up to take it to show to the young ladies who attend my church. I started to read it and immediately began to cry! All I could think about was how I wished I would have had such a blessed magazine when I was single. I was saved when I was just a child, but I was not raised in a strong Christian family. My mother subscribed me to secular teen magazines and I was pushed to attend college. All through high school I prayed for a godly husband some day, because my heart&#8217;s desire was to be a wife and a mother. Unfortunately, this was not looked upon as praiseworthy, I really struggled because I didn&#8217;t have the guidance, encouragement, or knowledge that I was receiving a Godly call as a woman. After a year and a half of college, I married my high school sweetheart. He was a God-fearing man. Praise God He answered my prayer! I guess what I am trying to say is that I am praising God for your magazine, even though I didn&#8217;t have such a thing available when I was a young woman, but can be sure that I will tell every young woman I can about your <i>Dear Princess</i> magazine! Even though I am married, your magazine encouraged me in my &#8220;single&#8221; walk with the Lord. May the Lord richly bless you for the work you are doing for Him and His Kingdom! You really blessed my soul!</p>

<h2>We Need Your Help!</h2>
<h1>Dresses vs. Pants&#8212;Which?</h1>

<p>Several readers have been grappling with the issue of modesty&#8212;&#8220;Why dresses?&#8221; &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with pants?&#8221; We believe in modesty, but thought that perhaps it would be both edifying and insightful to hear what others believe and how you&#8217;ve dealt with all that comes with wearing dresses. Mothers, grandmothers, older sisters: we welcome your writings; we&#8217;d really appreciate your wisdom in this subject.

<h1>My Closest Confidant</h1>

<p class="author">Laura Erickson</p>

<p>My closest Confidant! Have you met Him? Is He yours? Might we now take a closer look at this One who would be a Companion to all who seek after Him?</p>

<p>There are truly many ways to define Him of whom I speak: Mighty God, Lord of lords, King of kings, Deliverer, Redeemer, Savior, Protector, Shepherd, True Vine, Bridegroom, Master, Christ, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace, and many more. But my purpose today is to look at and understand a certain aspect of His character that makes up the One who is my truest Friend, Guide, Counselor, and most specifically, my closest Confidant.</p>

<p>A confidant is a person entrusted with secrets or a confidential (trustworthy) friend. Maybe we should ask &#8220;Is He worthy of our trust and confidence?&#8221; David said in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+118">Psalm 118</a>,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;O give thanks unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>; for he is good: because his mercy endureth for ever&#8230;. I called upon the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> in distress: the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> answered me, and set me in a large place. The L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?&#8230;&#8203;It is better to trust in the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> than to put confidence in man. It is better to trust in the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> than to put confidence in princes&#8230;. The L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+118%3A1%2C5-6%2C8-9%2C14" title="Psalm 118:1,5-6,8-9,14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 118:1,5-6,8-9,14)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A15-16">Hebrews 4:15-16</a> we read,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.&#8221;</span>
In my Bible I have noted by <i>boldly</i>: &#8220;or, &#8216;with confidence.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<p>To further illustrate the trust He is worthy of I would like to mention a couple qualifying factors about the Lord. First, He is the One who knows me altogether, for He is my Creator.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, thou knowest it altogether&#8230;. I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+139%3A1-4%2C14" title="Psalm 139:1-4,14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 139:1-4,14)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>To think! The Lord knows me through and through: how I work, think, act, and why. How privileged we are to go to the Creator, the Expert who has all the answers. Indeed,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+139%3A6" title="Psalm 139:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 139:6)</span></a></span>
In Him we can completely trust, and in His will we are completely safe. He has plans for us,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;thoughts of peace, and not of evil.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+29%3A11" title="Jeremiah 29:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jeremiah 29:11)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>I remember when this reality especially hit me. It was a day when the little things seemed like mountains and a small change like a disaster. As I drew apart to think and pray, I became aware of the wonderful truth of our loving Creator.
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+4%3A19">I&nbsp;Peter 4:19</a>
stood out to me:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Commit the keeping of [your] souls unto him in well doing as unto a faithful Creator.&#8221;</span>
Our God cares. He that created me would surely take care of all my needs. I needed to trust.</p>

<p>This brings be to my next thought: His way is best. On our own we will go astray, but
<span class="scripture">&#8220;As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+18%3A30" title="Psalm 18:30"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 18:30)</span></a></span>
Will we be as the simple ones who love their own way and hearken not at the voice of the Lord?
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh&#8230;. But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+1%3A24-26%2C33" title="Proverbs 1:24-26,33"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 1:24-26,33)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>I have found His way is best in my own life. When I commit all my thoughts and ideas, hopes and plans to God, how beautifully He works all things out than if I struggle in my own strength!</p>

<p>I can think of times when I had bright plans and hopes of some future event, only to have them dashed. Then disappointment would come in like a flood and I would be tried exceedingly. A change of plans was synonymous to a battle with tears of disappointment then. How I am thankful that that last word can be put in! The Lord had led to me to higher ground to see what really matters. I am learning to say with Paul,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philemon+1%3A21" title="Philemon 1:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philemon 1:21)</span></a></span>
He has taught me to give over my plans and hopes into His keeping. Whatever happens I know He has designed it for my best. It is not that I always perfectly understand, oh no. It is that I am learning to trust.</p>

<p>And so I desire to have these verses lived out in my life:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Trust in the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and be shall direct thy paths.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+3%3A5-6" title="Proverbs 3:5-6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 3:5-6)</span></a></span>
My own understanding is pitifully inadequate compared to the great wisdom and knowledge of God. But it is often so easy, so natural to lean on it. It takes an effort to bring each thought and care in subjection to Him. It is by having our confidence fully in the Lord that we can trust Him without hesitation, and then to obey. These two are almost inseparable in nature: for to obey is to trust, and to trust is to obey.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+55%3A8-9" title="Isaiah 55:8-9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 55:8-9)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out! For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor? Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+11%3A33-36" title="Romans 11:33-36"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 11:33-36)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Both these passages speak of God&#8217;s greatness. How small we are! Is it not rightfully our privilege to trust such a One, to put our full confidence in Him? Is He worthy of our trust? Yes, a hundred times, yes!</p>

<p>Let us now consider this step of putting our trust in God. David said,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;In thee, O L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, do I put my trust,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+31%3A1" title="Psalm 31:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 31:1)</span></a></span>
and went on to speak of his dependence in God. Are we leaning on the Lord and seeking His will? Then we have the promise of an ever- present Help, a mighty Deliverer, a Strong Rock, a Guide and Strength in this life. How can we expect the Lord&#8217;s direction and protection if we stubbornly go our own way? We need to put our trust in Him.</p>

<p>Trust. Webster&#8217;s 1828 <i>Dictionary</i> renders it &#8220;Confidence; a reliance or resting of the mind on the integrity, veracity (habitual observance of truth), justice, friendship or other sound principle of another person.&#8221; It is an act of our will, not of our emotions. We can feel many different ways, but if our will is set to trust the Lord we have a solid foundation. When our confidence is fully in the Lord we have no reason to be fearful, worried, discouraged, or care-worn. He is able, trust Him!</p>

<p>I would like to put before you a thought to illustrate our relationship with the Lord as our closest Confidant. Have you ever had the feeling that your parents wouldn&#8217;t approve of something you have thought of doing? Or maybe a friend suggested something, but you knew deep down that Daddy probably wouldn&#8217;t like it? Have you ever had this experience before and struggled with your conscience whether to go and ask (knowing quite well the answer would be &#8220;no&#8221;) or just avoid asking? I have, and believe each one of us has had such an experience.</p>

<p>As we grow up we began to realize the boundaries of our home, the allowances and feelings of our parents, and later their convictions and desires. How often have we seen or heard of the willful child who knows how to &#8220;play the game&#8221; and get his way with his more lenient parent. Quite quickly children realize which is sympathetic to their &#8220;plight,&#8221; and the one whose word is law. Even as we grow older we often find ourselves sharing with those who will &#8220;understand me.&#8221;</p>

<p>These actions are also found in our relationship with our Heavenly Father. As His children do we bring our every care, concern, and desire to Him, or do we unconsciously find ourselves hiding something, because deep down we know He wouldn&#8217;t approve? There is a poem I found that was along this same line:</p>

<p>Shall we not then form the habit of bringing each thing in our lives under God&#8217;s authority? Habits are important things that are hard to break once they are formed. If we form the habit to cheerfully obeying in our earthly homes, how much more easily it is to give such service to our Heavenly Father! God is interested in us, in what we do, say, and think. He wants to be our Confidant, our closest Friend, in whom we can confide all things. How much He loves us! Why should we shrink from telling Jesus, from taking time to be with Him, from seeking His guidance in all areas of our lives? Let me share how the Lord has  blessed me in this area:</p>

<p>Lately I have taken time to spend of few minutes for &#8220;a confidential chat with Father&#8221; after lunch each day. I have always made a purpose of having my personal devotions each morning after I awake, and at night I commit all the doings of the day, my concerns and cares to Him, but a mid-day talk helps to renew my focus in the midst of everyday activities. By setting aside that time I can
<span class="scripture">&#8220;come boldly unto the throne of grace&#8230;&#8203;and find grace to help in time of need.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A16" title="Hebrews 4:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 4:16)</span></a></span>
I can prioritize my activities to spend time on those things that really count. I can obtain of Him the love I need to serve as Jesus did, the patience to bear and forbear, the humility to walk with God. What wondrous place this is to sit at His feet and know that He listens and cares and has all the answers! There is no better offering that we can give than to &#8220;Please Him.&#8221;</p>

<p>So now, let us learn to lean on the Savior each day, to bring all things in subjection to Him, to ask His permission. A chorus of a hymn I love:</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus!<br />I cannot bear my burdens alone;<br />I must tell Jesus! I must tell Jesus!<br />Jesus can help me, Jesus alone.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/I_Must_Tell_Jesus/index.html" title="I Must Tell Jesus">*</a></p>

<p>We can make our confidences with Jesus part of every day. What sweet peace there is in knowing that all is with the Savior and we are clear with Him!</p>

<h1>I Will Never Leave Thee Nor Forsake Thee</h1>

<div class="blurb">
<p class="first">Jana&#8217;s Note: It was only a couple months ago when I saw a small paragraph in a magazine, asking prayer for a family of 10 who had recently lost their mother. I was deeply shocked by this news, putting myself in this family&#8217;s place, and thinking what it would be like if my mother suddenly died. As the oldest girl was my age, I sent off a card expressing my sympathy. Heather wrote back a thank-you note, giving a brief update on her family. A different friendship was begun, unlike any I have ever experienced. We are not considered pen-pals formally, yet we have still exchanged letters for many months now. And Heather was gracious enough, per my request, to tell her story to you all.</p>

<p>Some of you may have questions, or wish Heather told more of her feelings during this time. As she wrote to me, &#8220;While our feelings may be important to some extent, they aren&#8217;t the most important. We want to give God the glory and focus on what he has said and done and how he has protected us, rather than on our feelings and what we have said or done. I want God to get the glory and not bring attention to myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>May you all encouraged and strengthened by her true story, as you remember God will truly never kave you nor forsakeyou.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Hello! My name is Heather Eley and I&#8217;m 16 years old. I&#8217;d like to share how the Lord has helped our family through some trials this past year.</p>

<p>First, let me introduce my family: Daddy (David), myself, Elijah (14), Joshua (13), Benjamin (10), Jessica (9), Jacob (7), Samuel (5), Josiah (3), and Rebekah (2). It&#8217;s a real blessing having a big family, especially when everyone helps each other and we all work together!</p>

<p>Daddy used to drive a semi truck long-distant until about a year ago when our mother passed away. On April 13, 1997, Mommy died suddenly. It was a big shock to all of us because we weren&#8217;t expecting anything like it. Mommy was in good health and had been perfectly well that day. The name that the authorities used is PRESUMED CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA SECONDARY TO CARDIAC ISCHEMIA RESULTING IN CARDIOMYOPATHY AND DIFFUSE INTERSTITIAL FIBROSIS.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>It was a Sunday evening, about 8:30 p.m., and Daddy and Joshua were on a semi-truck trip in California at the time. The rest of us children were at home, upstairs, all ready for bed, except for Josiah and Rebekah.</p>

<p>They were still downstairs with Mommy when we suddenly heard a scream. It sounded like one of the little ones, like Josiah or Rebekah. We ran downstairs to see what had happened and there was Mommy lying on the kitchen floor. Rebekah was standing by her, whimpering slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; I cried, and went down on the floor beside Mommy. &#8220;Mommy! Mommy!&#8221; I cried over and over again, trying to get her attention. &#8220;Elijah, call 911,&#8221; I said. I can&#8217;t describe the feelings that went through me at that time. I was thinking, &#8220;Daddy&#8217;s not here, what are we going to do? We&#8217;re all alone!&#8221; The other children were crying and praying out loud and I tried to comfort the little ones. I was praying, &#8220;Dear God, please don&#8217;t let Mommy die, Lord, please!&#8221;</p>

<p>Elijah also called our Grandpa and Grandma Eley, Daddy&#8217;s parents, and soon the house was full of people. Within minutes the ambulance, Grandpa and Grandma Eley, and also Grandpa and Grandma Cox (who live about a half mile down the road) were all there. The ambulance people wanted us to stay out of their way, so we all had to go in another room.</p>

<p>The coroner, one of the men that came with the ambulance, came in and asked us, &#8220;We need to know the details to determine the cause of death.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he said that, it seemed like my heart just broke and I thought, &#8220;There&#8217;s no hope.&#8221; I turned to Grandma Eley, who was crying, and said, &#8220;Are we going to lose her?&#8221; and she just said, &#8220;Yes, Heather.&#8221;</p>

<p>We were all sobbing.</p>

<p>The coroner wanted me to tell him what had happened, like how we had been upstairs and we heard the scream and so on. I told him what I could think of.</p>

<p>What a hard night! I didn&#8217;t sleep at all but I did much praying. The events just kept running through my mind. It was hard for me to trust God completely, knowing that He knew what was best. I kept wondering why it had to be Mommy. People die, but why did our own mother have to?</p>

<p>But, because Mommy was saved, I know that she&#8217;s in Heaven today and what a blessing to know that! When we think about the joys she&#8217;s experiencing up there, we wonder why we&#8217;re crying about it. That&#8217;s not to say we don&#8217;t miss our mother because we do very much. There are times when I think, &#8220;Oh, I wish Mommy were here to see Rebekah! She&#8217;s so cute in her new dress.&#8221; (Rebekah really does get cuter every day.) But now it&#8217;s much easier for me to trust God completely and we have something to look forward to now, being reunited with Mommy in Heaven one day. Over the past year, we as a family and I, as an individual, have grown much closer to God. He is a good Lord!</p>

<p>The next day, Monday, Daddy called home from California. Elijah told him what had happened and it was a shock to him too. He parked his truck in Nevada and then flew home with Joshua, so they could get home quicker. There were hugs and tears. As I was talking to Daddy, he said, &#8220;I think we&#8217;re going to have to sell the semi truck and I&#8217;ll stay home with you guys.&#8221;</p>

<p>I said &#8220;Okay.&#8221; But I kind of liked our big, red semi truck! It meant changes for us but we also have another business, a rental business, and Daddy was driving the truck on top of that. Now Daddy runs the rental business and can stay around home. We rent apartments out to people and the older children help in the cleaning and painting when needed. That&#8217;s one thing we can be thankful for, that God blessed us with a business that allows Daddy to be home with us most of the time and at which we can all work.</p>

<p>We had Mommy&#8217;s funeral on Friday, April 18. It was a hard time for us. But the pastor that gave the message told about five things that happened when Mommy died. They were: (1) She found out how easy it was to die. (2) She instantly met her guardian angel. (3) She was quickly ushered into heaven. (4) Mommy met all of her saved friends and relatives who had gone on before her and were waiting to greet her. (5) She was then ushered into the presence of God.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s an awesome thought, to be ushered into God&#8217;s presence!</p>

<p>After the funeral was over, we went back to our house. Daddy was planning to take us children over to Grandpa Eley&#8217;s so he could fly back to Nevada and get the truck. We were going to leave at about 5:00 p.m. and we had a few hours then so we all took naps.</p>

<p>For some reason we overslept till about 5:30 p.m.&#8212;maybe God allowed it. But when we woke up and saw it was 5:30, we hurried and started packing our clothes to go to Grandpa&#8217;s house. It was then that we noticed that several police cars had pulled into our driveway. Daddy said, &#8220;I wonder what they want,&#8221; and went out to talk to them. We children didn&#8217;t know what was going on. I honestly thought the police were talking to Daddy for some business reason.</p>

<p>Later, I found out these people had come from the Welfare Department to take us children away and put us in foster homes. We found this out after we had been put in the homes. The Child Protective Service (CPS) is a government program that tries to &#8220;help&#8221; families by removing the children from the home if they think or have been told that the children are being mistreated, neglected, or abused. We didn&#8217;t realize right then, but the CPS was here to take us away.</p>

<p>Daddy and the men came back into the house. Daddy said, &#8220;These men want to take you away for a few days.&#8221;</p>

<p>One guy interrupted, &#8220;We want to take care of you while your dad gets his truck, okay?&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at Daddy. He said, &#8220;Is everything all right, Heather?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s going on,&#8221; I said, trying to keep from crying.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t either. But just remember, there&#8217;s power in prayer,&#8221; Daddy said.</p>

<p>Then we told Daddy good-bye and went outside with the policemen. They took us in their cars to the jail in Winchester and had us wait while they called foster homes. No one wanted to take all nine of us so we were separated into three groups&#8212;myself, Jessica, and Rebekah in one; Elijah, Joshua, and Benjamin in another; and Jacob, Samuel, and Josiah in another. By the time they got us off into the foster homes, it was pretty late&#8212;about 10:00 p.m. Jessica and I were upset and we stayed awake for a long time that night, crying and praying together.</p>

<p>My mind was full of questions&#8212;&#8220;What&#8217;s happening? Why is it happening?&#8221; I still didn&#8217;t really know all the details and was scared.</p>

<p>I asked some of the welfare workers if I could call Daddy, or my brothers, or even Grandpa and Grandma Eley, who did approve of our lifestyle. Their answer was no and I asked why. They said they couldn&#8217;t let us see or talk to each other because it wasn&#8217;t allowed.</p>

<p>Now really, I couldn&#8217;t understand that at all. Why wasn&#8217;t I allowed to talk to the boys? All I wanted to do was to find out where they were and what had happened to them. I found out they don&#8217;t allow that in the fostering system.</p>

<p>Most children removed from their home the way we were will never be allowed to return home or see their parents again. The CPS wants to break all family ties. This also gives them the advantage while they are interrogating us. We spent six days in our foster homes, separated like that. During that time I was questioned by the welfare workers about our home. They tried to dig and find out things about our family that they&#8217;d be able to use against us, and they tried to get me to say and confess to things that were not true. I always told them the truth, though&#8212;we weren&#8217;t being mistreated, our home was fine, we were being fed enough food to eat, and so on. They would ask me personal questions.</p>

<p>Once they even said, or suggested, that we children had something to do with Mommy&#8217;s death. The authorities could not determine the cause of death the evening mommy died. Rumors started flying. The people at the CPS said that maybe Elijah had gone down and strangled Mommy or that Daddy had come home and did it also.</p>

<p>My foster home was really dirty. There were two big dogs living in the house and dog hair was everywhere. It was filthy, like it hadn&#8217;t been cleaned for a long time. The people smoked, and there was loud rock music. I ask the foster mother if I could help clean the house. She let me do it.</p>

<p>I had never had to lean on Jesus so much in my life. One verse I found so encouraging was
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+13%3A5-6">Hebrews 13:5-6</a> where it says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.&#8221;</span>
What a promise! We must never fear what men can do to us, for God promises, He will never leave us!</p>

<p>On Thursday, April 24, we children were able to come back home. On Wednesday and Thursday there had been a court hearing to decide whether we could come home. It was a wonderful answer to prayer and it taught us a lot about trusting in God even when we don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on. We were so happy to be together again!</p>

<p>There was a hospital that did an autopsy, and after a couple of months it showed that Mommy had died a natural death with heart failure. Her heart just stopped beating. And you know, that&#8217;s probably the easiest way to die&#8212;when God says, &#8220;It&#8217;s time to come home,&#8221; and He just takes your soul.</p>

<p>After we came back home, the Welfare Department wanted Daddy to put us in a school. We had been home schooling for ten years and so that was a big change. We had to go to a Christian school but it was only for six weeks until school was out for the year. Our Aunt Diane, Daddy&#8217;s sister, helped out tremendously during that time. She came from Indianapolis, where she lives, every single weekend until September and helped with the housework.</p>

<p>There was one time in June when the Welfare Department wanted Daddy to sign an agreement with them but Daddy said it would be morally wrong and refused to do so. By signing the agreement, Daddy would be admitting guilt of the abuse and neglect that they said was taking place. He would also be agreeing to allow the government to provide all kind of services and supervision to us.</p>

<p>The judge threatened to put us children back into foster homes if Daddy didn&#8217;t sign the agreement by June 20. We were afraid that they would take us away again but Daddy talked to each of us and asked us if we children would have faith that God would keep us together if he didn&#8217;t sign. Again, <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+13%3A5-6">Hebrews 13:5-6</a>&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;I will not fear what man shall do unto me.&#8221;</span>
We had faith and so Daddy didn&#8217;t sign it. On June 20, we had a prayer meeting and rally here at our home. Many people came and it lasted several hours. We were all very sober. We prayed so earnestly that God would just keep those people away from our family and He did. They never showed up! Praise God! It was only by God&#8217;s power that we stayed together.</p>

<p>During the summer we children were ordered by the judge to go see a counselor to get grief counseling. The counselor was not a Christian. The Scriptures says
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;q=Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly " title=""><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> ()</span></a></span>
So we refused to counsel with him. (Other passages concerning ungodly counsel:
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Numbers+31%3A16">Numbers 31:16</a>,
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Kings+12%3A6-11%2C28">I&nbsp;Kings 12:6-11,28</a>;
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Chronicles+10%3A10%2C+22%3A3">II&nbsp;Chronicles 10:10, 22:3</a>,
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Job+2%3A9">Job 2:9</a>.)
He was part of the Welfare Department and was looking for something to use against us, too. We prayed again that the Lord would protect us throughout this situation, and praise His name, He did.</p>

<p>In the fall, the Welfare Department wanted us children to go back to the Christian school. But Daddy said that it was his conviction that we home school. He had compromised his conviction in the spring, and put is in the Christian school hoping to pacify the Welfare Department. Daddy said that he could not continue to compromise his conviction so once again we spent much time in prayer asking for God&#8217;s protection. Once again God fulfilled His promises to us and kept His hand of protection over us as we started home schooling again.</p>

<p>We were under the scrutiny of the Welfare Department until finally, in November, the judge unexpectedly called for a hearing. The judge placed a gag order on the hearing; that is, we could not tell anybody about it. Daddy&#8217;s attorney said it appeared that the judge was angry, probably about us children not counseling with the counselor and that Daddy was home schooling us again. We were told that the judge may find in contempt, put him in jail and put us children back in foster care. But as you know, by now we had seen God&#8217;s hand working and protecting us time and time again and keeping us together as a family. God had brought us this far as a family, and allowed us to stay together. It was hard to think that we would be separated now.</p>

<p>But we were still concerned about our situation. It appeared that it had taken a turn for the worst. So again we and our friends and family prayed and once again God was with us. He protected us and kept us together as a family. The morning of the hearing, the judge canceled the hearing and rescheduled the hearing for November 21. The judge opened this hearing up to public and then dismissed our case! We feel that the turned his heart.</p>

<p>We had been praying for a dismissal for so long and God finally said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; It was such a belssing to be free again and not having people tell us we have to do this and we have to do that. What a tremendous answer to our prayers.</p>

<p>Our Cox grandparents, and the entire Cox family&#8212;aunts, uncles, etc.&#8212;are very angry and bitter towards us. They can&#8217;t accept the fact that they lost their daughter and sister, and they&#8217;re taking their anger out on us. They are the ones who called the Welfare Department on us and told them many untrue things about us. They have never approved of our lifestyle. We live a simple and plain life, dress modestly, wear head-coverings, and home school. We have church in our home, sometimes with others, sometimes by ourselves.</p>

<p>The Coxes don&#8217;t like this. They are very worldly and sinful people, and have a lot of bad influences in their home. They are demanding that we be forced to go down to their house to visit them and are trying to get a judge to issue an order to that effect. We don&#8217;t feel comfortable going to their home, and really don&#8217;t want to.</p>

<p>Daddy has offered for them to come to our home to visit us, but to this day they have refused to do so. It is sad that there are people like this out there; but the only thing we can do is pray for them.</p>

<p>Daddy said that God is preparing us children for something ahead in our lives. As I think back over all that has happened in the past year, I know God had a purpose in it. And as time goes on, we as Christians may have to stand for our faith more and more. What we went through was really religious persecution, and a spiritual battle for the hearts and souls of our little children. We were told by the Welfare Department that there are other lifestyles that they wanted us to know were okay to live.</p>

<p>Daddy said that, as time goes on, Satan will contiune to use the government and its agencies to pesecute born-again, blood-washed saints of God, and that the time could come when we could be persecuted much like the martyrs of years gone by. We need to pray diligently for strength to endure whatever God may allow.</p>

<p>It takes trials and stretching to bring us closer to God and make us on fire for Him; I want to learn all the lessons He has for me to learn! May God bless each of you as you strive to serve Him!</p>

<p>&#8212;Heather Eley</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_7/lesson_reading.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="350" /></div>
<h1>A Bible Lesson</h1>

<p class="author">Jenny C. Rutty</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Girls:</p>

<p>This ought to be a very precious letter to you, as it is from the dearest book on earth; and I hope it will be gladly received by all the readers, and carefully treasured, that it may bring forth fruit for eternity to the praise and glory of our God.</p>

<p>Perhaps many of you agree with me that there is a great Creator, and that in wisdom and love He has planned all things for the good of man. Then He would desire our instruction in regard to Himself and what would be for our present welfare, and also for the great future; so He gave us counselors. He knew we would wonder about many mysterious things, and in His great wisdom and love He did not wish us to be counseled wrong; so His counselors are established forever. There is no subject, no circumstance of life, or anything unnecessary to be known, but what we may find perfect instruction therefore from these wonderful counselors. Then what are they? You question. We will let King David answer, in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+119%3A24">the 119th Psalm, 24th verse</a>, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counselors.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>The testimonies of God are the counselors; for they are His solemn declarations, establishing and proving all that is true and righteous that is necessary for our present and eternal good, and they are found in the Holy Bible. He says to every man, woman and child,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+19%3A20" title="Proverbs 19:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 19:20)</span></a></span>
After this short life everyone has an eternity [missing words] of two with the Devil in hell. So God wants us to be wise concerning this, and prepare for that which is best.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;There are many devices in a man&#8217;s heart; nevertheless the counsel of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, that shall stand.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+19%3A21" title="Proverbs 19:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 19:21)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The counsel of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+33%3A11" title="Psalm 33:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 33:11)</span></a></span>
From the first scripture we see that there are many devices in a man&#8217;s heart, so that all who know not God are devising ways of their own to accomplish their desires.</p>

<p>Though they do so, only the counsel of God shall stand to all generations, or forever. So if we want wisdom that shall endure, that will not change, we must get it from God, through the Bible.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+32%3A8-9" title="Psalm 32:8-9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 32:8-9)</span></a></span>
Oh, the preciousness of this scripture to my soul! May it be also to you. Here He says He will instruct and teach you in the narrow way in which we must walk while living in this world for He will guide us with His eye. He sees all there is before us, and as we yield to Him He will so guide us that no harm can come to us; for He can see so much better than we can, yet we can by His help see His blessed way. Oh, bless the Lord! Once I thought that God&#8217;s word was such a strange book that no one could understand it: that each one should study it and then do the best they could to walk in the way. But, oh, I am so glad that He has promised to guide us with His eye, so we shall be guided alike and aright, in the way of truth and righteousness; and our natures are so subject to God that there is no need to be held in as animals, by force of bit and bridle, but we are by the Lord God constrained to obey His directions.</p>

<p>Shall we believe God? In
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+45%3A5-6">Isaiah 45:5-6</a>,
He asserts in strongest language:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I am the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me: That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, and there is none else.&#8221;</span>
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+45%3A12">12th verse</a>:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.&#8221;</span>
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+45%3A19">19th verse</a>:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.&#8221;</span>
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+45%3A22">22nd verse</a>:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.&#8221;</span>

<p>Should we not put our trust in God when He is so careful to give us such valuable instruction, asserting that all He speaks is right, and in Him is salvation for all people? Did you ever think that if you hesitate to believe what God says, you are doubting or disbelieving, and you want some greater evidence that His word is true, when there is no greater; for by His word all things were created, and the Creator is greater than the created. So if it is a great responsibility to believe in God, it is also to disbelieve Him; and every one who has heard of Him is doing one or the other, so the responsibility rests upon you, whether you admit it or not.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord: And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+12%3A29-30" title="Mark 12:29-30"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 12:29-30)</span></a></span></p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+4%3A23-24" title="John 4:23-24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 4:23-24)</span></a></span>
John, one of the disciples, says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;God is love,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+4%3A8" title="I&nbsp;John 4:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 4:8)</span></a></span>
and again,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1%3A5" title="I&nbsp;John 1:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 1:5)</span></a></span>
Again, be says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;No man hath seen God at any time.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+4%3A12" title="I&nbsp;John 4:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 4:12)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>God so loved us that He sent His Son to suffer and die for our salvation, and to speak to man His precious truth. So Jesus, the Son of God, testifies that God the Father is the true God, and we should love Him with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength, and worship Him in spirit and in truth; for God is a Spirit.</p>

<p>Now you can understand that the great God is a Spirit of love and light, and no man can see Him with natural eyes. Therefore we are told that when we come to God we
<span class="scripture">&#8220;believe that he is.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+11%3A6" title="Hebrews 11:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 11:6)</span></a></span>
Some do not want to serve God, because they cannot comprehend him with the natural senses; but God says, &#8220;Believe.&#8221; So we know it is not by sight or feeling that He is known, but by faith.</p>

<p>To believe is to trust, or to have faith, and we are continually, in many ways in our everyday life, using faith; so it is not strange that it should be used in the salvation of our souls. We trust our parents and loved ones, our neighbors and friends, our teachers and books, and even strangers. Then is it strange that we should need to trust God? So many stumble and worry because they cannot understand faith, and we cannot please Him without faith, and faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
If those who need faith will carefully and humbly study the Bible, they will soon believe in God, and then seek Him (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+11%3A6%3B+Romans+10%3A17">Hebrews 11:6; Romans 10:17</a>).
</p>

<p>Can you realize that unbelief is very wicked, and dishonors God? If you were to tell something that was of great benefit to those you loved and they should say, &#8220;Oh, we do not believe that,&#8221; you would feel much grieved, because they would lose the benefit you desired they should have, and would feel sad to think they would dishonor you by acknowledging that they thought you were untruthful, false, and, in stronger language, a liar. Oh, dear girls, can it be possible that anyone of you would grieve the great and wise God by not believing Him, when He desires to give you so many precious things that you do not at all comprehend now? For He says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+2%3A9-10" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 2:9-10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 2:9-10)</span></a></span>
The natural man cannot realize what wonderful things God has for God&#8217;s children but they having His Spirit have them revealed to them and enjoy many of them in this life, and shall enjoy the rest in the great eternity of God&#8217;s presence.</p>

<p>In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+11%3A6">Hebrews 11:6</a> God says we
<span class="scripture">&#8220;must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.&#8221;</span>
So we see that He expects us to seek Him.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Those that seek me early shall find me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+8%3A17" title="Proverbs 8:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 8:17)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+6%3A33" title="Matthew 6:33"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 6:33)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Seek, and ye shall find.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+11%3A9" title="Luke 11:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 11:9)</span></a></span>
Then it is not enough to believe in the existence of God, but we must seek Him in His own way, by humbling ourselves before Him and believing on His Son Jesus whom He sent to save the world.</p>

<p>Now I do hope and pray that some of you will begin to seek after God, that you may be saved from sin. In the next letter I will tell you what the second step is; for hearing and believing in God is the first step.</p>

<h2>Stitches &#8217;N&#8217; Stories</h2>
<h1>According to His Will</h1>

<p class="author">Katie L. Hart</p>

<p>&#8220;Cock-a-doodle-doo!&#8221; crowed the Wilbery&#8217;s big, red rooster, early one April morning in 1754. A yellow-haired, thirteen-year-old girl opened her blue eyes and smiled. Morning was Beth&#8217;s favorite time of day.</p>

<p>She heard chattering in the kitchen and knew Mother was starting the fire, so she straightened her coverlet and dressed. She was fixing her mobcap when she heard, &#8220;Sarah! Elizabeth!&#8221; She met her fifteen-year-old sister on the stairs as they responded to Mother&#8217;s call.</p>

<p>Beth, Sarah, and six-year-old Nan helped prepare breakfast as the boys and Father fed the animals. Father was going to town that day, so Sarah packed him a dinner.</p>

<p>That evening, when Father came home, he had news. &#8220;I&#8217;ve decided we are going to move. This farm is old and the ground if overworked, so we must sell it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are we going?&#8221; five-year-old Caleb wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ohio.&#8221; As he said this, Beth gasped. &#8220;We&#8217;ll grow flax, oats, wheat, and corn, plus a vegetable garden. We&#8217;ll raise sheep later and start a weaving business, since cloth is scarce there. We might buy cotton after a while, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beth listened mutely as the rest of the family discussed the move around the supper table for over an hour, then cleared the table as they continued talking. She had washed, dried, and put away all the dishes for her nine-member family before they stopped. Many thoughts went through Beth&#8217;s mind as she worked. <i>Moving to Ohio! Why, God, why?! We can&#8217;t move! It just isn&#8217;t fair! I&#8217;d never see Rebekah again!</i></p>

<p>Father glanced at the sun, then opened the bible and started to read <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+7">Matthew 7</a>.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;&#8230;&#8203;Ask, and it shall be given you&#8230;&#8203;For every one that asketh receiveth&#8230;.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+11%3A9-10" title="Luke 11:9-10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 11:9-10)</span></a></span></p>

<p><i>That&#8217;s my answer,</i> Beth thought. <i>I&#8217;ll just ask God, then we won&#8217;t move to Ohio!</i> She was happy. So Beth asked God everyday to prevent her family from going to Ohio. As the day of departure neared, Beth noticed God has not done anything to answer her prayers. <i>But maybe He&#8217;s waiting to answer at the last moment,</i> she reasoned.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, the Wilbery family climbed into three farm wagons loaded with food, supplies, and weaving equipment. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;re bringing the loom and spindle,&#8221; Sarah said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it will give us something to do on the long evenings,&#8221; replied Mother. Beth was silent. She was unhappy. She felt that God had let her down. He hadn&#8217;t done what He had promised He would do.</p>

<p>The wagons started with a lurch. Beth waved to Rebekah, whose family had come to see them off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodbye!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodbye!&#8221;</p>

<p>At first they traveled over smooth, level roads, but as the days passed, the trail became more rocky and steep. Beth also grumbled and complained more and more each day. She had a little hope that something would happen so they could move back to Philadelphia, but that hope diminished day by day. She began to doubt if the Bible was true. <i>If this isn&#8217;t true, then the whole Bible might not be true,</i> she reasoned, as she lay one night thinking about Rebekah.</p>

<p>Finally they reached a small valley. It had a creek running through it and a grove of trees about a five-minute walk from a rise of land in the center of the valley. &#8220;That&#8217;s where we&#8217;ll build our house,&#8221; said Father, pointing to the rise.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_7/according_house.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="200" /></div>
<p>The next day, Father, eleven-year-old Peter, and sixteen-year-old David started cutting logs for their cabin. Three weeks later, the family was ready to move into the finished house. Father gathered the family for a special devotion, once everything was inside. &#8220;We will read the entire book of First John. I will read the first chapter, your mother will read the next, then David, Sarah, and Beth can read. <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1">First John, chapter one</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8216;That which was from the beginning&#8230;.&#8217;</span>&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<p>Beth stopped listening, as she often did now. She had no desire to listen to something she thought was false. She started thinking about Rebekah, the fun times they had together, the stories they told each other, the times they got into trouble&#8230;.</p>

<p>A gentle bump interrupted her train of thoughts. &#8220;It&#8217;s your turn to read, Beth,&#8221; her sister Sarah said, handing her the Bible.</p>

<p>She cleared her throat, then began:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ&#8230;.&#8221;</span>
<i>I wish I didn&#8217;t have to read this.</i>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;&#8230;&#8203;He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life&#8230;.&#8221;</span>
<i>Do I have the Son? Do I have life?</i>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;&#8230;&#8203;And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us: And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him&#8230;.&#8221;</span>
<i>That&#8217;s it! I didn&#8217;t ask according to His will! God wanted us to move to Ohio!</i>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;&#8230;&#8203;And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding&#8230;.&#8221;</span> <i>Now I have understanding!</i>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;&#8230;&#8203;Amen.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+5" title="I&nbsp;John 5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 5)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Beth handed the Bible back to Father.</p>

<p>That night Beth was lying in bed and thinking about what had happened. All that time, when she had been complaining and believing God had not done what He had promised her, her family was really following God&#8217;s will. God had planned for them to move here. The only reason she had wanted to stay was because of Rebekah.</p>

<p>During the next few weeks, the rest of the family noticed a change in Beth&#8217;s attitude. She was more cheerful and willing to help, and she barely complained anymore. She listened closely during devotions and began to love Sundays, as the family studied the Bible most of the day. Father and Mother asked Beth about it. She told them everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell us about this? We had no idea that you were so sad about leaving Pennsylvania. I thought you were happy here,&#8221; Mother said in response to Beth&#8217;s story.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you would be disappointed in me,&#8221; whispered Beth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;d better get to bed, young lady,&#8221; smiled Father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Okay, I will. Goodnight.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day the Wilbeiys were surprised to hear the sounds of horses, oxen pulling wagons, and people talking. &#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; asked eight-year-old Samuel.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Rebekah and her family!&#8221; Beth shouted joyfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; asked Mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Beth, &#8220;and they&#8217;re right in the front of our house now!&#8221;</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the two friends were sitting down together and talking without ceasing. &#8220;Guess what?&#8221; said Rebekah, &#8220;we are planning on building a house within walking distance of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is wonderful! I&#8217;m so glad we&#8217;ll be neighbors again,&#8221; said Beth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me, too,&#8221; said Rebekah. &#8220;I&#8217;ve missed you so much!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So have I,&#8221; said Beth. <i>Thank you, God, for answering my prayer!</i></p>
