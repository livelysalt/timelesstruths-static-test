<h1>About <i>Dear Princess</i></h1>

<h2>What Is the Purpose of <i>Dear Princess</i>?</h2>
<p><i>Dear Princess</i> is a publication for young ladies who seek and strive to please their Heavenly Father. I, Abigail Spinks, started in the fall of 1996 with a burden to share trials and victories, and in turn to be encouraged and share with other girls.</p>

<p>In January 1998, I felt a burden to ask Skye Erickson to come and take the place of co-editor. She accepted&#8212;as you can see&#8212;and we are both learning lessons in patience and longsuffering with each other in between the enjoyable times.</p>

<p>We want not only to create a publication with homemaking skills, but one that will encourage girls in becoming spiritually prepared for their future homes. We need to have a vision of trusting the Lord long before the actual time. If we wait until the time we really need grace to wait, we will be ill-prepared. The more grace we have at home with our families now, the more victories we will have behind us to strengthen us in our future trials and battles in homes of our own, if the Lord wills for us to be married. As my mother says, &#8220;The way you set your sails is the way your ship [life] is going to sail.&#8221; Right now we&#8217;re in the moldable time of our lives. The way we hinder or allow the Lord to mold us now is the way we re going to be when we&#8217;re older. We want to be molded the way Jesus wants us to be and we know there are other girls who want to as well. We need to encourage each other along the way.</p>

<h2>When You Write</h2>
<p>Submissions are extremely welcome! Letters, articles, recipes, homemaking hints&#8230;&#8203;we are always in need of them! Articles on how the Lord has taught you to be gentle, patient with siblings, humbleness&#8212;anything the Lord has taught you, please share! Two particular ideas: <b>serving others</b> and <b>contentment at home</b>. Anything would be appreciated and considered, but we&#8217;d love to hear about what you&#8217;d have to say on these subjects. Stories are welcome too.</p>

<p>Also, a discussion column has starting forming, but we need many more submissions for it. If you have any thing you&#8217;d like to ask other readers about, please send in your questions!</p>

<p>Your letters are a source of great encouragement to us; please state in your letter if you wish it not to be printed. We&#8217;ll try to answer the letters, but we can&#8217;t answer them all.</p>

<p><b>Mothers, grandmothers, and older sisters</b> are very welcome to write in to encourage and teach us younger women.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness&#8230;&#8203;teachers of good things; That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+2%3A3-5" title="Titus 2:3-5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Titus 2:3-5)</span></a></span>
</p>

<h2>A Note From the Editresses</h2>
<h3>&#8220;Freely Give, Freely Receive!&#8221;</h3>
<p>As we have received several donations this time around, we feel a need to make things a little bit clearer in regards to &#8220;free will offerings.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Lord has made it clear to us that this is His magazine and He will provide the means to publish and send <i>Dear Princess</i> out. He has showed us the scripture:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Freely ye have received, freely give.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+10%3A8" title="Matthew 10:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 10:8)</span></a></span>
We wish to obey His Word, and to our minds, charging a subscription would not be freely giving.</p>

<p>Recently, a sister sent in some money and said, &#8220;I hope this will get me a few issues; I&#8217;ll try to send more later.&#8221; While we really appreciate her thoughtfulness, we earnestly hope and pray that we have not implied that to receive <i>Dear Princess</i>, you must send money. By saying <i>Dear Princess</i> is supported by &#8220;free will offerings,&#8221; we do not mean a sort of &#8220;pay as you can&#8221; subscription. To us, from what the Lord has shown us, it means that it is money that the Lord burdens someone to send in to help out with the costs. That is what we believe the
<span class="scripture">&#8220;freely you have received&#8221;</span>
part of the verse means. We hope we have cleared any misunderstandings on this subject and if you have any questions, please feel free to write.</p>

<p>We want to write a <i>special</i> little note of thanks for the ones who wrote letters. They were such sweet encouragements! There is nothing so encouraging as to get a letter written from the heart, from a sister in the Lord!</p>

<p class="signature">In His tender care,<br />Skye and Abigail</p>

<h1>With Love, from the Editress</h1>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_6/editress_writing.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="300" /></div>
<p>I climbed out of the car and slowly walked up the walk and into the house. Once in my room, I lay down my Bible and songbook and removed my sweater. Then returning to the front of the house, I sat down on the couch and mechanically began folding blankets from the little girls that I had baby-sat last night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tired?&#8221; Mama questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I replied, again pushing back the tears that had threatened to spill over more than once that day.</p>

<p>The day had been long and tiresome&#8212;a usually encouraging Sunday had been spent listlessly, almost endured. Nobody had tried to discourage or slight me&#8212;why then this feeling? A feeling I couldn&#8217;t quite label? A feeling of discouragement, of loneliness? A tiredness of that which you don&#8217;t care or feel like going on being an example, or to speak up when it would be so much easier to be silent. A tiredness that tells you how much easier it would have been if you had not committed yourself to such and such. A discouragement that makes you disappointed in yourself, of progress you wish you could make on your Christian life, of battles that you think you&#8217;ll never win. Coming to the realization that you are learning lessons over again that you had thought you&#8217;d mastered long ago. Why did I have these feelings?</p>

<p>I folded and put away another blanket.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; Mama asked, noticing my quiet and reserve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; I murmured half to myself. Why did I feel so depressed? Hadn&#8217;t I got several letters of encouragement lately? Hadn&#8217;t the Lord supplied the means to even print the last issue of <i>Dear Princess</i>? Then why this feeling?</p>

<p>I returned to my room and took down my book <i>Dear Princess</i> and stared at it dumbly for a few minutes, conversations replaying over and over in my mind like a broken record. I didn&#8217;t feel like opening it. Returning the book to the shelf I stared out the window listlessly&#8230;&#8203;thinking of all the things I needed to do next week.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;As thy days, so shall thy strength be.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+33%3A25" title="Deuteronomy 33:25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Deuteronomy 33:25)</span></a></span>
The words fell on my ear like a bomb being dropped. It was almost like someone in the room had spoken to me, I heard them so clearly.</p>

<p>Other snatches of scripture entered my mind,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Commit thy way unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass&#8230;. Rest in the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, and wait patiently for him&#8230;. The steps of a good man are ordered by the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>: and he delighteth in his way. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> upholdeth him with his hand.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalms+37%3A5%2C7%2C23-24" title="Psalms 37:5,7,23-24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalms 37:5,7,23-24)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Oh, what beautiful promises! But it is easy though, like Peter, to get our mind off the promises and look around at the crashing, rolling waves that could sweep us under. We look at the problems, the trials around us, and forget that the Lord has promised to uphold us, to strengthen. We look at the waves and not straight at Jesus&#8217; face. Why do we do this so easily? It is not that we <i>want</i> to get our eyes off Jesus face and to look around us&#8230;&#8203;but why then do we?</p>

<p>Do we have to go through times of discouragement and failures all the time? Is it impossible to keep our eyes on Jesus all the time?</p>

<p>From what the Lord has shown me, yes, there always will be things to get discouraged about. If we start looking at the trial, all the discouraging things about it, all its problems, we can&#8217;t look straight at Jesus.</p>

<p>Daddy always told me that there are two ways to go through a trial; one way is to work the trial and the other is have the trial work you. To have you work the trial is to look to Jesus, to keep your eyes fixed on Him and Him only.</p>

<p>To have a trial work you is to do what I was doing&#8212;letting the comments that had made me discouraged, dig in and fester.</p>

<p>To have a trial work you is to look at the waves coming upon you, to take your eyes off Jesus, to get swept under all the problems that Jesus intended for you to rise above. It&#8217;s no fun to be worked by a trial. The encouraging things of the day seem depressing, arguments start, and things get said that no one intended to say.</p>

<p>But we don&#8217;t have to be worked by a trial&#8212;it may come, but we always have the choice to work it or have it work us, and we don&#8217;t have to make a failure or get discouraged over it.</p>

<p>Too often, I&#8217;m afraid, the reason we get discouraged is that we look at the size of the trial and get scared and try to take things into our own hands, instead of resting in the Lord.</p>

<p>I found a passage in <i>The Lure of Divine Love</i> that could express this thought better than I ever could:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">We were living out on the frontier, forty miles from the nearest hamlet. There was a fair mountain road, but Husband conceived the possibility of driving over the mountainside along the Rock Creek Canyon, so as to visit an old friend who lived there.</p>

<p>He was well acquainted with the country, from riding after stock. But he found it to be a most hazardous undertaking by vehide. There was a long stretch on that mountain trail so steep and sidelong that it seemed that the whole outfit would roll down the mountain side. (It was only merciful Providence that prevented it.) There was no way back, there was no way even to stop, there was nothing to do but keep going. The horses did nobly, the brake held and worked fine, but the hind wheels would slide, and the upper-side wheels would be off the ground at times. And that great canyon lay in purple shadows a mile or more below.</p>

<p>It was a frightful situation. Husband&#8217;s face was white as death, and I clasped my babe to my bosom with a fluttering heart. Husband was an expert horseman, and I had the utmost confidence in him as a driver, and very little in myself, and yet at two different times I involuntarily reached out, with that feeling as if I must take the reins from his hands, but it would have been sure destruction if I had. There were no words exchanged, but after we had passed the extreme danger he silently handed the reins over for me to take and to do the driving, and I recall even now how I felt as I drew back, saying, &#8220;Oh, no, no, no! I don&#8217;t want to take the reins.&#8221;</p>

<p>I never forgot the realization I had of the frightful consequences, if I had taken the reins into my own hands on that dangerous mountain side with that great, rock-ridged canyon far below.</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[Helm, Kathryn E.; <i>The Lure of Divine Love</i>]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>And you see, I believe it is that way with us&#8212;involuntarily we reach out to take hold of the trial, but it is too big for us&#8212;we cannot take it. Then it works us down, because we did not give it to One who can handle it.</p>

<p>There are two other ways that can be very discouraging just to think about that the Lord has seemed to burden me to share with you.</p>

<p>The first is to do what I was doing&#8212;looking ahead at the future.</p>

<p>It is <i>always</i> discouraging to look ahead and realize that you&#8217;ve had too much planned. Have you ever thought to yourself, &#8220;I&#8217;ll never get all that done! Oh, dear, how am I going to do&#8230;&#8203;?&#8221; Inevitably you&#8217;ll get discouraged when you think about it that way. Why? Because we get out of God&#8217;s umbrella. He has only promised us grace for&#8212;when? Today. This hour. This moment. What would it be like if God let us see all the trials we would have when we are married (granting that that is His will for our lives)? Could we bear it? Most certainly we could not. Why? Because He has only given us the grace we need for in our lives right now. He will give us the strength for those trials when we come to them.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+6%3A30-34" title="Matthew 6:30-34"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 6:30-34)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>One other thing that can make us discouraged: looking back. Have you ever looked back at the week where you&#8217;ve been tried and pressed and scanned all your failures? Does that make you feel encouraged? I know it doesn&#8217;t make me feel uplifted to know I haven&#8217;t done something right. Looking back at a failure is all right if you are looking at it in order to learn something from it. But to simply dwell on some mistake you&#8217;ve made can be extremely discouraging. When you get discouraged over a mistake or a failure, and let your mind think about it, you let the devil take an advantage over you. He magnifies the failure till it looks like a mountain. He wants to make you so discouraged that you feel that you&#8217;re unable to live for the Lord.</p>

<p>But it takes courage not to look back at our mistakes and simply go on, trusting the Lord and asking Him to help us to live closer to Him. Not look at yesterdays problems and perhaps how we did not handle them as well as we could have. That was <i>yesterday</i>. I have <i>today</i> to work on now.</p>

<p>I pray that you will have been blessed by what I have shared with you, and I desire your prayers that I will keep my eyes fastened on Jesus, for surely how worthy He is of our trust.</p>

<h1>Laying All at His Feet</h1>

<h2>Getting acquainted with Angela Joy LeFevre</h2>
<hr class="minor" />
<h2>Please tell us about yourself.</h2>
<p>My full name is Angela Joy LeFevre. I am 5&#8217; 3 1/2&#8221; tall. I have dark, reddish-brown hair, green-blue eyes and glasses.</p>

<p>My birthday is March 26, 1982.</p>

<p>Some of my interests are: spending time with animals, singing, playing the guitar and piano, letter writing, cooking, sewing, and ice skating.</p>

<p>I am so thankful the Lord has given me the ability to do all these things. I know I take it for granted, at times, being able to use my hands and eyes and all the senses God has given us. We are truly blessed.</p>

<p>My goal in life is to follow after the Lord with all my heart. I desire to be a humble servant for Him, and to truly be the <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+31">Proverbs 31</a> woman. I know there is so much the Lord has for me and I don&#8217;t want to settle for anything less than He wants for my life.</p>

<p>As far as what I want to do with my life, I have felt a real desire and burden for the people in Mexico. I have a desire to go down and serve the people and share God&#8217;s love with them. For now, the Lord has taught me to be content right where I am. Our homes are training grounds for our future lives. I would also like to marry and have children if that is what the Lord has planned for me. It is so wonderful and such a peace for me to leave my life ahead of me in God&#8217;s hands. I sometimes start to worry about my future life, and about how everything will work out and come to pass, but if we lay all that down at His feet, and our will is lost in His, He will work everything out in our life.</p>

<h2>What has been your schooling experience?</h2>
<p>I have been homeschooled all of my life, except for a year in kindergarten. It is so wonderful that we have the freedom to homeschool in our country. It is so nice to be all together and not separated by public school systems. It also allows us a lot of freedom we otherwise would not have.</p>

<h2>Could you please tell us about a typical day at your home, or maybe an unusual one?</h2>
<p>Well, I will try to tell you about a typical day at our home. Every day certainly isn&#8217;t the same, but we basically keep to the same schedule. I usually get up at 5:15, get washed and freshened up and do my exercising, etc. I then have an hour of quiet time which ends around 7:15. All the children are awakened between 6:30 and 7:00. I then do my chores outside and fix my hair. Between 7:30 and 8:00 we start school. At 9:15 we all flock to the living room for prayer and sharing time, and then at 10:00 we prepare and eat breakfast. (We only eat two meals a day, besides some fruit everyone eats when they get up.) Following breakfast, I clean up the kitchen, and everyone else does their morning chores&#8212;sweeping the floors, emptying the garbage and trash, picking up toys, and running the carpet sweeper, etc. After that we continue on with school. Usually I am done with my school by 1:30. (Sometimes earlier, sometimes later, depending on the day.) At 1:30 the five little ones lie down and take their naps. The house seems nice and quiet then!</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_6/laying_book.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="200" /></div>
<p>I usually write letters, go outside, cross-stitch, do some cleaning, play guitar, or whatever else needs to be done during nap time. Between 3:00 and 3:30, the children get up from their naps, and then we start dinner. (depending on the meal, we start earlier.) We then eat at 4:00 and Dylan cleans the kitchen after dinner. We then fill in the time we have left until bed with just being together as a family, reading, devotions, and finishing up anything we want to accomplish before the day is over. At 8:00 the children are tucked in bed, and then we older children go to our own rooms, and have time for ourselves, for reading, writing letters, or whatever we want to do that is quiet. Between 9:00 and 9:30 I go to bed.</p>

<h2>Is there any special blessing that the Lord has blessed you with that you would like to share?</h2>
<p>That is a very hard question! The Lord has done so much in my life and in our family, that I don&#8217;t really know where to start. I guess the biggest thing God has done is bringing our family together. It is such a long story, I wouldn&#8217;t have enough room to write it all down, but I will try to get the basics across.</p>

<p>To start with, the birth mother of my brother and myself passed away when we were little. The Lord then brought Mom and Dad together, and they were married! A couple of years later they were blessed with my little sister, Hannah. We were living in Arizona at this time and Dad and Mom felt the leading to move to Ohio. So Dad put in an application for a job, and eventually in 1990 we moved.</p>

<p>A couple of years later we signed up for foster care with a possibility of adoption. In 1992, the Lord blessed us with Grace, who we picked up from the hospital when she was three days old. A couple years later, we adopted Charlotte, Grace&#8217;s sister. The Lord worked so much. The social workers told us that there was a very good chance these girls would be slow and unhealthy, but we started praying, and praise the Lord, He intervened. They are perfectly normal girls.</p>

<p>After that the Lord blessed us with half-brothers. That is a very long story, but we finally adopted them. Lord worked in them and through us in a very powerful way. Even at times when we were all stressed out, sick, and on the verge of tears, God gave us the strength. We look back now, and wonder how we ever did it, but we really didn&#8217;t do it&#8212;the Lord did it through us.</p>

<h2>Please tell us about your family.</h2>
<p>Daddy is the spiritual leader and head of our family. He has an outgoing personality and he is very friendly, always there to encourage, guide, and give us a helping hand. God has blessed him with a wonderful job and schedule. He is a wonderful provider for our family. I am so thankful to have a father that loves the Lord and is seeking Him with his whole heart.</p>

<p>Mommy is a homemaker and a great blessing to our family. She is more of a quieter person, but has her very outgoing and funny times. I am so thankful the Lord has blessed me with her. I learn from her spirit every day. The Lord has used her in so many ways to reveal areas of struggle in my life. Mom always seems to have a word of encouragement for others, and the Lord has given her a lot of discernment and wisdom.</p>

<p>Dylan (17) has more of a quiet, serious manner, but when he&#8217;s around us, and people he knows really well, he can be quite outgoing and funny. He loves to play the piano and sing. He is learning the banjo and guitar and the Lord is giving him songs which he is writing. He is working as a full-time carpenter and he enjoys the work.</p>

<p>I am more of a quiet person, but can be outgoing around people I know really well, also. As I said before, I love music and singing, and I also love anything that has to do with animals. I love to organize and I like for things to be just perfect.</p>

<p>Hannah (10) has a very bubbly, outgoing personality. She loves to read. And she likes to make and do things for people. She loves to play and has a very good imagination. She also loves babies and is good with watching children. She continues to grow in the Lord, and desires to please Him.</p>

<p>Bryan (8) was adopted last year and we all love him very much. He has a very outgoing personality, and he loves to help others. He is ready to give of himself, and he is always there to help in any way he can. He is fascinated with calendars and dates and has a splendid memory. He also loves to memorize scripture verses. There have been times where he has told his friends their father&#8217;s birthday when they couldn&#8217;t remember themselves!</p>

<p>Paul (6) was also adopted last year. He can be very loud and silly, but when he is around other people, he is more shy and timid. He is very good with the smaller children, and he loves to cuddle up in someone&#8217;s lap and have books read to him. He also loves to brush our hair. He has such a smile, that when he smiles, you can hardly resist from smiling back.</p>

<p>Grace (5) has a very outgoing &#8220;go-get-&#8217;em&#8221; type personality. She loves to talk, and you have to be careful what you say around her, because she will repeat what she hears! She seems to have a real talent for music, and is always humming, singing, or whistling. She sings right on pitch and can carry a melody very well.</p>

<p>Ken (4) was adopted along with Bryan and Paul. He has an outgoing personality, and is very observant. He likes cowboy things, and one day he asked Mom if she could buy him some cowboy sweatpants! He loves to pray during prayer time, and he also loves to recite scripture verses he has learned.</p>

<p>Charlotte (3) is quite a small, petite little girl, and has a beautiful, radiant smile. She loves to run and play, and is very sweet. She reminds me of one of those Precious Moments characters.</p>

<p>Mikailah (15 mo.) is a real joy and blessing to our family. We were all so surprised last year when Mom told us she was going to have a baby, after not having one for nine years! Mikailah can say about everything now, and she loves to dance to music and praise the Lord. She adds a lot of fun and laughter to our family.</p>

<h2>Do you have a favorite recipe or poem that you would share with us?</h2>
<p>That is a very hard decision; I guess I will share one of the poems that has been an encouragement to me:</p>

<h2>The Road Is Too Rough</h2>
<p class="author">Olga J. Weiss</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;The road is too rough,&#8221; I said, &#8220;Dear Lord,<br />There are stones that hurt me so.&#8221;<br />And He said, &#8220;Dear child, I understand,<br />I walked it long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;But there&#8217;s a cool, green path,&#8221; I said.<br />&#8220;Let me walk there for a time.&#8221;<br />&#8220;No, child,&#8221; He gently answered me,<br />&#8220;The green road does not climb.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;My burden,&#8221; I said, It is far too great;<br />How can I bear it so?&#8221;<br />&#8220;My child,&#8221; said He, &#8220;I remember its weight,<br />I carried My cross, you know.</p>

<p class="verse">But I said, &#8220;I wish there were friends with me,<br />Who would make my way their own.&#8221;<br />&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; He said, &#8220;Gethsemane<br />Was hard to face alone.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">And so I climbed the stony path,<br />Content at last to know<br />That where my Master had not gone,<br />I would not need to go.</p>

<p class="verse">And strangely then I found new friends,<br />The burden grew less sore;<br />And I remembered&#8212;long ago,<br />He went that way before.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<h2>In conclusion is there anything else you would like to add?</h2>
<p>I am so thankful for all the Lord has done for me and in my life. He is so faithful! I just want to encourage each one of you to seek the Lord above all else and with your whole hearts. He is showing me the fullness of all He has for all of us. We need to know Him for who He is.</p>

<p>May the Lord bless each one of you as you seek Him.</p>

<h1>Letters from the Heart&#8230;&#8203;</h1>

<hr class="minor" />
<h2>Encouraging Words&#8230;&#8203;</h2>
<p>Thanks so much for <i>Dear Princess</i>. It was a great source of encouragement, a confirmation that I&#8217;m doing the right thing! God provided this encouragement at just the right time!</p>

<p>I want to commend the beautiful set-up of <i>DP</i>! It has good taste and variety of fonts, graphics, etc. Whoever works on <i>DP</i> has done an outstanding job!</p>

<p>Thank you, Abigail for your article on <a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_5/Acceptance_with_Joy/index.html" title="Dear Princess 5/Acceptance with Joy">Acceptance with Joy</a>&#8221;! That was a challenge even though its something I&#8217;m already working on. God is still working on me, as I am yet unperfected. Someday when His refining fire has purged all dross, we will be pure gold. But&#8230;&#8203;first the refining fire!</p>

<p>Thanks to Sister Patsy Cain for helping uncover the mystery of God&#8217;s love. I am discovering what true love&#8212;His love&#8212;is! His love is unconditional! His love enables us to love, to forgive, to love the sinner and hate the sin. His love tells someone when they are wrong and leads them to His paths of righteousness. Oh, through hard lessons I am learning that!</p>

<p>Thanks to Amy Zander for that essay on &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_5/Waiting_for_His_Best_in_Marriage/index.html" title="Dear Princess 5/Waiting for His Best in Marriage">God&#8217;s Choice</a>.&#8221; That is the best way I have ever seen it put! I can&#8217;t understand why it is so seemingly hard to rest in His arms, and so easy to backslide into the world!</p>

<p>Thanks to Brother and Sister Busbee for sharing <a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_5/A_True_Courtship_Story/index.html" title="Dear Princess 5/A True Courtship Story">their story</a>. I have chosen courtship, and at times when the devil would discourage me with the thought of my few friends, or that I was &#8220;old-fashioned,&#8221; and &#8220;how will you find anyone?&#8221; It is encouraging to read of a marriage when God was clearly at work and man at rest! You are a living testimony of His faithfulness! So many times we take advantage while we rest in His peace and yet that is what He wants!</p>

<p>Thanks for printing &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_5/Beautiful_Things/index.html" title="Dear Princess 5/Beautiful Things">Beautiful Things</a>&#8221;! May God bless you, dear sister! You have showed me I can be beautiful&#8212;inwardly, because outward is worthless!</p>

<p>Thanks for the challenge from Brother Spinks! Thanks also for the confirmation of <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+3%3A14">Revelation 3:14</a>. I had always wondered what the cold, hot, and lukewarm was.</p>

<p>Thank you to Laura Erickson, you are such a dear friend! You have encouraged me in my walk to overcome certain things. I will definitely use your tips in overcoming pride! Thanks for sharing them to our benefit as well!</p>

<p>Thanks to Brother C. E. Orr for your challenge and exhortation to remain pure. Not only physically, but in mind, in heart, in deed, in shunning influence with the impure and those who would defile us.</p>

<p>Again thanks so much for such an encouraging magazine. I felt as though I were uncovering a precious gem. Please add me to your mailing list. Thanks so much!</p>

<h2>Meek and Quiet Spirit&#8230;&#8203;</h2>
<p>Spring is just around the corner! Don&#8217;t you just love God and delight in Him even more during this special season as you watch life spring forth anew in His beloved creation?!</p>

<p>Your <a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_5/index.html" title="Dear Princess 5">Winter/Spring &#8217;98 magazine issue</a> of <i>Dear Princess</i> was a special treasure. The Lord used it to confirm a few things in my heart, to bring fresh encouragement, and to cause my heart to rejoice in Him, as I see so many young girls desiring and seeking after God, loving Him, and walking in His ways.</p>

<p>Do you know that that is the essence of a meek, gentle and quiet spirit&#8230;&#8203;seeking God, loving Him, and delighting in His ways? Too often we think that &#8220;becoming a doormat&#8221; for others to walk over is meekness. Meekness is actually a strength&#8230;&#8203;a strength and surrender to God. Meekness is a dependence upon God, a trust in His will, a confidence in His desire and in His willingness to bring about His will in your life. No matter what trials and hard times or blessing and abundance may come about in your life, it gives you an opportumty to rest in meekness, gentleness and quietness in His hands. Everything always works out for us toward the beauty and fulfillment of His will coming to pass in our lives. Praise the Lord!</p>

<p>Enclosed is a little gift to help out with the expenses of your precious ministry. May the Lord multiply it in your hands many times over.</p>

<h2>Thankful, Blessed, and Encouraged!</h2>
<p>I got the <i>DP</i> issue and it was great! Thanks for mailing it to me. I am really thankful, blessed, and encouraged. The article &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_5/Acceptance_with_Joy/index.html" title="Dear Princess 5/Acceptance with Joy">Acceptance with Joy</a>&#8221; really spoke to my spirit, and Laura&#8217;s article &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_5/Casting_Down_the_Strongholds_of_Pride/index.html" title="Dear Princess 5/Casting Down the Strongholds of Pride">Casting Down the Strongholds of Pride</a>&#8221; was interesting, too.</p>

<h2>Lessons From a Lamb</h2>
<p>I pray that this letter finds you and your family strong in the Lord and rejoicing in the multitude of His tender mercies! Oh, how gracious our Savior is! How precious have been His promises to me:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+13%3A5" title="Hebrews 13:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 13:5)</span></a></span>
and
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+32%3A8" title="Psalm 32:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 32:8)</span></a></span></p>

<p>A couple Sabbaths ago, Jochebed, the little lamb, got to go to church for the children&#8217;s story. I was quite amazed at how well she behaved. Together Sarah and I told the story about how Hannah&#8217;s leg got broken&#8212;and we found her, after a long search, down over the precipice along our creek. We think the dogs chased her off a rock ledge up the stream a ways, and she fell into the creek, was swept down the stream, and somehow managed to get up on the shore in a spot where there were rock cliffs so she couldn&#8217;t reach the pasture. Anyway, the object lesson we shared was that in the story the shepherd was Jesus, the sheep are us, and the dogs are Satan. Sometimes the enemy brings trials to our lives that seem to drive us into the valley of the shadow of death. Yet, even more, the Shepherd is with us and says to us,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience. But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+1%3A2-4" title="James 1:2-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 1:2-4)</span></a></span>
Sarah found these scripture verses and shared them with me as the object lesson the Lord taught her from our experience with Hannah.</p>

<p>Just last Sabbath morning, before leaving for church, my dad ran out to the barn to check the sheep. He was just in time to find that my yearlings had given birth to twins, and one of them was not breathing because the bag was still over its face. My dad immediately set to work getting the little lamb to breath. If he had been a few minutes later, the little lamb, Violet, would not have been revived! My dad said that he lust felt the strong prompting of the Holy Spirit to run out and check, although he had been out there shortly before and nothing was happening. How important it is that we listen to the Lord&#8217;s still, small voice so that He can give us life in Him moment by moment! Little Violet has needed much care, for the mother does not have much milk, and what she does have, big brother, Oak Tree, who is over twice the size of the tiny lamb, gets it all.</p>

<p>Also, Skye, I want you to know that I have enjoyed the <i>Dear Princess</i> magazine. In the last one I received, there were some thoughts that were just what one of my friends needed. This girl recently ran away from home (her family situation was terrible) and now she is at a teen care camp. Do keep me in your prayers that I will discern the Lord&#8217;s wisdom in just what to share with her, for I am the only one of her friends that is allowed to write to her.</p>

<h2>Encouraged on Courtship</h2>
<p>I was lent the <a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_5/index.html" title="Dear Princess 5">Winter/Spring 1998 issue</a> of <i>Dear Princess</i>, by my friend Sylvia Kembel. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would like to start receiving it. Also when the back issues are available, I would like them, too. Thanks!</p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_5/A_True_Courtship_Story/index.html" title="Dear Princess 5/A True Courtship Story">A True Courtship Story</a>&#8221; was very helpful; it is so good to hear about people who kept themselves emotionally and physically in check even when it is difficult to do. I am so glad you are addressing the courtship topic because it is so very important in the way we live as Christians.</p>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">Below are excerpts of letters two dear friends of mine wrote me awhile back. I was blessed by their encouraging words, may you be blessed also.</p>
</div>


<hr class="minor" />
<p class="noindent">Dear Abigail,</p>

<p>Hello from Missouri!</p>

<p>I was so encouraged to hear that you are having the same struggles and victories I am experiencing right now. The Lord has been speaking to me about my attitude and my devotions. I feel as if I need to be a servant to Him right where He has placed me&#8212;at home. Sometimes I feel like I am not doing much for the Lord, but He has shown me how my attitudes affect and influence my younger brothers and sisters and also those around me. I would appreciate your prayers at this tune.</p>

<p>I have started reading a chapter in my Bible every day. I have found it helps me to retain more if I keep a Bible-reading journal. I write down the things I have gleaned from each chapter. Thank you for the suggestion about leaving the Bible open&#8212;I will try it.</p>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">[Note: My suggestion was to leave your Bible open during the day where you would look at it often. As you pass the spot where your Bible lies, take a few seconds to read a verse and meditate while you work.]</p>
</div>


<p>Your friendship has been such an encouragement to me and hopefully we can run together
<span class="scripture">&#8220;the race marked out for us.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A2" title="Hebrews 12:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 12:2)</span></a></span>

<p class="noindent">Dear Abigail,</p>

<p>Greetings in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ! May His love, joy, and peace fill your heart today.</p>

<p>I want to thank you for sending me <i>Dear Princess</i>. I know it must take <i>so</i> much work. May God bless your ministry. It is a blessing to me.</p>

<p>I am sorry to hear you, your sister, and Dad suffer from pollen allergies. I will be praying for you. I also know what it&#8217;s like. I know it&#8217;s miserable and not fun. We know, though, that the Lord is able to touch and heal you all from this! He has shown me, through books, some ways to build my immune system so I won&#8217;t be affected as badly. I take a spoonful of honey and raw pollen from our fields, together, every day. I have taken it for a year now and, praise the Lord, it seems to work!</p>

<p>It is such a blessing to me to hear how the Lord has worked in your heart to draw you closer to Him. I have found trials are such a blessing. It doesn&#8217;t seem so then, but God always uses them to draw us near to Him. He has been so faithful to me in my life. I just want to praise Him for all He is and for all He has done. He is really giving me a even deeper desire to know Him more, for who He really is, and to worship Him and give Him the glory and honor He deserves. We, as Christians&#8212;I should say, I&#8212;seem to be able to so easily settle for so much less then He has for us, without really meaning too. I do want everything He has for me, but sometimes it is hard, because my flesh rebels.</p>

<p>I wish also we could talk with each other face to face. I really don&#8217;t have a good gift at writing on paper what&#8217;s in my heart, but I know the Lord will help me. May the Lord bless your faithfulness and keep your heart tender. Let&#8217;s keep pressing forward to the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus! I really want you to know that your <i>DP</i> is a blessing and God is using you.</p>

<p class="signature">In Christ&#8217;s love,<br />A sister in Christ,<br />Angie LeFevre</p>

<div class="blurb">
<p class="first">Thank you for your sweet letter, Angie. One thing you mentioned&#8212;&#8220;my&#8221; <i>DP</i> is a blessing&#8212;Skye and I want <i>Dear Princess</i> to be totally <i>God&#8217;s</i> publication.</p>

<h1>Seek Him Early</h1>

<p class="author">E. M. Bounds</p>

<p>We ought to pray before seeing anyone. Often when we sleep long or meet with others early, it is mid-morning before we begin in secret prayer. This is a wretched system and it is unscriptural. Christ arose before day and went into a solitary place. David says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+63%3A1" title="Psalm 63:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 63:1)</span></a></span>
Family prayer loses much of its power and sweetness and we can do no good to those who come to seek from us. The conscience feels guilty, the soul un-fed, the lamp not trimmed. Then when finally in secret prayer, the soul is often out of tune. It is far better to begin with God&#8212;to get our soul near Him, to see His face first, before another.</p>

<p>The men who have done the most for God in this world have been early on their knees. He who fritters away the early morning, its opportunity and freshness, in pursuits other than seeking God, will make poor headway seeking Him the rest of the day. If God is not first in our thoughts and efforts in the morning, He will be in last place the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Behind this early rising and early praying is the ardent desire which presses us into this pursuit after God. Morning listlessness is the index to a listless heart. The heart which is behind hand in seeking God in the morning, has lost its relish for God. David&#8217;s heart was ardent after God and so he sought Him early, before daylight. The bed and sleep could not chain his soul in its eagerness after God. Christ longed for communion with God and so, rising a great while before day, He would go out into the mountain to pray. Prior to receiving the power of a personal Pentecost, the disciples, when fully awake and ashamed of their indulgence, would know where to find Him. Those who have mightily impressed the world for God were found seeking Him early.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_6/seek_praying.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="370" /></div>
<p>A desire for God which cannot break the chains of sleep is a weak thing and will do but little good for God after it has indulged itself fully. The desire for God that drags at the beginning of the day will never catch up.</p>

<p>It is not simply the getting up that puts men to the front and makes them captains in the Lord&#8217;s host, but it is the ardent desire which stirs and breaks all self-indulgent chains. The getting up gives vent, increase and strength to the desire. If they had lain in a bed and indulged themselves, the desire would have been quenched. The desire aroused them and put them on the stretch for God and this heeding and acting on the call gave their faith its grasp on God and gave to their hearts the sweetest and fullest revelation of God. This strength of faith and fullness of revelation made them saints of eminence and the conquest of their lives comes down to us and we have entered into the enjoyment of their victories. Now we that have taken our fill in enjoyment, will we drink of their productions?</p>

<p>If ever there was needed a people who will seek God and seek Him early it is now&#8212;those who will give the freshness and dew of effort to God and secure in return the freshness and fullness of His power; that He may be as the dew to them, full of gladness and strength, throughout all the heat and labor during this time of rebuilding the walls of the city of God. The Babel stone of laziness after God is a crying sin. The children of this world are far wiser than we. They are at it early and late. Are we seeking God with ardor and diligence? Mark this&#8212;no man gets God who does no follow hard after Him and no soul follows hard after God who is not after Him in early morn.</p>

<p>The silence that is now being broken no doubt began at the closet door of prayer, for the soul cannot prosper with the neglect of prayer. Saints, let us rally to the call of prayer. Let us seek Him early in the morning.</p>

<h1>Pika&#8217;s Treasure&#8212;What About Mine?</h1>

<p class="author">Lisa Panasuk</p>

<p>Seated in the warm sunshine on top of a large boulder, I view a peaceful, alpine lake. The lofty heights of Mt. Jefferson (10,497 ft) rise in majestic splendor above the tree line in the Cascade mountains. In the stillness, broken only by an occasional song from the birds, I lay up the treasures on God&#8217;s Word in my heart, and share them with some special friends through writing letters.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I am startled from my thoughts by hearing a high pitched, &#8220;Peep! Peep! Peep!&#8221; Looking around, I spot my little, fury friend, a pika, sitting on top of a nearby boulder. A few moments later, the pika disappears under the boulder. But wait! There he is! On top of that boulder, under another, around another, over another, across a little sand&#8230;&#8203;he stops! Quickly he gathers a big mouthful of plant greens and ferns growing by a small rock. Then he hastily makes his way back to his home, up and over, under and around the boulders. I sit there, silent and amazed, intently watching the little creature. Again and again the little pika makes these hasty journeys. He gathers such big loads of plants that I wonder how he manages to carry them. He moves so quickly and across such uneven surfaces, not losing even a leaf. He seems to be in a hurry-scurry, as if snow is coming tomorrow. Storing up the treasure of food is his all-absorbing activity.</p>

<p>Are we this earnest in laying up treasure of the Bread of Life, the Word of Life, in our hearts? Says the Psalmist,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+119%3A11" title="Psalm 119:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 119:11)</span></a></span>
Another one of my favorite verses of instruction and promise is found in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Job+22%3A21-22">Job 22:21-22</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee. Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.&#8221;</span>
</p>

<p>Just as enthusiastically as the little pika was storing up the treasure of food, let us acquaint ourselves with Jesus, our Best Friend! He loves to have us lay up the treasures of His Word in our hearts, for He knows that thereby good shall come unto us. We will have peace, too, as we surrender our hearts to obey His Word! It is vitally important that we daily spend time in God&#8217;s Word for our spiritual food. We wouldn&#8217;t think of saying, &#8220;I just don&#8217;t have time to eat today!&#8221; But how many times do we say this about God&#8217;s Word?</p>

<p>The best part of my day is my time with my Best Friend in prayer and in His Word! What wonderful treasures He gives me every day as I dig for them and hide them in my heart! One way I enjoy hiding them in my heart is through Scripture songs. I have also found it especially helpful in my experience to ask the Lord to make me so sensitive to holy influences, that the lightest whisper of Jesus will move my soul to do His will. He will bring back His Words to our minds when the snows of temptation fly our way. If we listen to His still, small voice, we will hear Him reminding us to stay surrendered to Him. Isn&#8217;t He wonderful? He has taught the little pika to prepare for the winter snow storms soon to come upon him. He wants us to be prepared, too! He will keep us from falling! So let&#8217;s treasure up His Words in our hearts now!</p>

<p>The day is sunny and warm. After my noon quiet time with Jesus, I gather my books so I can go outside and complete my studies for homeschool. As I gather them up, the calendar hanging on my cupboard door falls down and the tack disappears. Laying down my armload of books, I begin looking for the tack. I can&#8217;t find it right away, and I am being tempted to get irritated. Finally, I find it and hang the calendar up. I pick up my books, then remember that I&#8217;ve forgotten my notebook. I open the cupboard door, and guess what? Down goes the calendar again!! Now I am really being tempted with irritation, but the Lord is calling for my heart, saying,
&#8220;My daughter, give Me thine heart&#8221; (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+23%3A26">Proverbs 23:26</a>).
As I realize the voice of my Savior and His Words come to my mind, I immediately make a decision and say, &#8220;Lord I give my heart now.&#8221;
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Not my will, but thine, be done.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+22%3A42" title="Luke 22:42"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 22:42)</span></a></span>
With peace in my heart, I hang up the calendar again and go outside.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t the end of my trials for the day, though. Thursday afternoons my mother and I usually clean the house. But today it is so sunny and warm! I don&#8217;t want to come in and clean house. Coming in anyway, I begin dusting. Again the Holy Spirit&#8217;s still, small voice is calling my heart to cheerful submission. He reminds me about the song of <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+53">Isaiah 53</a> that I earlier treasured in my heart. As I choose to begin singing this song, I realize that it has a message for me! Truly Jesus suffered much more than just cleaning house on a sunny day!</p>

<p>With this song in my heart, I cheerfully finish dusting. I begin cleaning the bathroom. Interrupting the song, my thoughts start drifting off to a situation with two of my good friends just the prior weekend. Self wants to justify my position and dwell on how their attitude toward me did not seem right. But the Holy Spirit is also whispering in my ear,
" <span class="scripture">&#8216;This is the way, walk ye in it&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+30%3A21" title="Isaiah 30:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 30:21)</span></a></span>!
Remember the verse you read in your devotions this morning from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+5%3A5">I&nbsp;Peter 5:5</a>, <span class="scripture">&#8216;Be ye clothed with humility: for God giveth grace to the humble.&#8217;</span>
This experience is to perfect in your life the sweet grace of humility. Think about how you can do your friends good.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is a struggle! Self doesn&#8217;t die easily! But as I give these thoughts to the Lord, He brings to my mind a way in which I can do them good. Then I go on singing Isaiah 53.</p>

<p>May we let our hearts be impressed with the important words of that chapter, and ever bear them in mind. Thus we will not so easily fall into temptation and our words would be few and well chosen.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s be like little pika and lay up treasures of God&#8217;s Word in our hearts! All its strength is ours! His victory is ours!</p>

<h2 class="subtitle">To Your Unsaved Relations</h2>
<p class="author">Sylvia Grace Kembel</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters:</p>

<p>Lately the Lord has laid it upon my heart to tell you of the difficulties and rewards of my family&#8217;s efforts to witness to our unsaved family, and to encourage you in this area, too.</p>

<p>It is much harder to witness to our relatives than to other who we come into contact with or meet. Perhaps this is because we are more acquainted with our relatives than somebody on the street, and perhaps we are even afraid to tell them. Let that last thought never exist in your mind! When you have the opportunity to witness, doubts come to mind (&#8220;What will they think of me&#8230;&#8203;?&#8221;), etc. We may even feel that this will take our reputation from good Christians to fanatics. Let us remind ourselves with the thought that we have no reputation to lose as our reputation is Christ&#8217;s, and witnessing will not tarnish our reputation but will add up more eternal rewards for us in Heaven!</p>

<p>Mama and Papa became Christians 18 years ago and ever since they have been praying and trying to sow seeds in the hearts of our family. Finally, just one year ago, Mama&#8217;s youngest brother, Peter, became a Christian. Sometimes we would begin to wonder if anything was ever going to happen, but this was an answer to 18 years of faithful prayer! Uncle Peter has remained steadfast and firm in his new belief, even though it meant that his wife would divorce him. Please pray for him, that he will continue to grow, and face all attacks with great courage. Sometimes the Lord will lay it upon your heart to speak to Grandpa or Aunt Sue, but they are maybe miles away or perhaps you think they are busy. Never doubt and always obey! Maybe the Lord is preparing their heart at that time.</p>

<p>One evening when I was baby-sitting for Mama and Papa, I felt a strong urge to speak to Grandpa. Then Satan flooded my mind with, &#8220;Do you even know what you will say to him? It is long distance. Mom and Dad wouldn&#8217;t be impressed if they found out you phoned him without their permission!&#8221; It was a great struggle, but I gave it to the Lord in prayer. I phoned Grandpa and talked to him. He had some pretty persuasive arguments, and sometimes I wouldn&#8217;t know what to say, but the Lord just gave me the words <i>He</i> wanted Grandpa to hear. When I later told Mama and Papa of this, Mama gave me some good advice&#8212;&#8220;Even though Grandpa didn&#8217;t want to hear what you had to say, and didn&#8217;t want to accept it, he can never forget your words. Perhaps the Lord will bring them up later at a crucial time, or he won&#8217;t stop remembering them.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is important to remember that you cannot just speak to relations and that&#8217;s it&#8212;you must pray, pray, <i>pray</i>. The Bible says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Pray without ceasing.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+5%3A17" title="I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:17)</span></a></span>
This is very important. James says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+5%3A16" title="James 5:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 5:16)</span></a></span>
Maybe all we can do is pray as our relatives do not want us to speak to them about anything to do with Christianity. Then we must make it our goal to pray daily for them. In closing, I&#8217;d just like to encourage you to witness, to let your light shine brightly, and above all, to pray. May the Lord help you in your endeavors to speak to your unsaved loved ones.</p>

<h1>The Colors of Our Country</h1>

<p class="author">Laura Erickson</p>

<p>It was early on the morning of the Fourth of July and I was having my devotions. After a few minutes I looked up to see my sister enter the room. &#8220;Looks like you&#8217;re wearing the right colors today,&#8221; I remarked playfully, noting her blue denim skirt, and red, white, and blue, plaid blouse. Glancing down she replied, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t plan to, but I guess I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sat contemplating this for a few minutes and my thoughts turned to our life as a Christian. Many people get caught up with being patriotic and like to wear the colors that signify their belonging to the United States, especially on the Fourth of July. How much more is it important to &#8220;wear&#8221; those colors that signify our citizenship in our Heavenly Country! Every day we should &#8220;put on&#8221; the clothing that portrays the life we are living.</p>

<p>Paul speaks of this same idea when he says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+3%3A12-14" title="Colossians 3:12-14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 3:12-14)</span></a></span>
God calls us His elect (chosen), holy and beloved children! He wants us to live as lights in this dark world, shining for Him. Our Lord is mighty and able to clothe us in these robes of righteousness. Let us take a closer look at the eight &#8220;clothes&#8221; spoken of in these verses.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<h2>Bowels of Mercies</h2>
<p>Or &#8220;a deep tenderness and benevolence of heart that treats others better than they deserve, overlooks injuries, and has compassion on offenders.&#8221;</p>

<p>To put on mercy is to have a mind-set to love your enemies, to overlook the faults or injustice in others, and to return good for evil. By God&#8217;s grace we can cheerfully do the work that someone shirked and love them still. By God&#8217;s grace we love the thoughtless child that ruined the project we had spent hours to complete. And by God&#8217;s grace we can speak kindly of another that has hurt us deeply.</p>

<h2>Kindness</h2>
<p>Or &#8220;the disposition which delights in adding to the happiness of others.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kindness is shown in cheerfully gratifying another&#8217;s wish, supplying their wants, or relieving their distresses. With love in your heart it is easy to be kind, for kindness always accompanies love.</p>

<h2>Humbleness of Mind</h2>
<p>Or &#8220;the state of being meek and submissive, especially to God&#8217;s will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pride is the opposite of humility, so to clothe oneself with humility one must not be proud. To be humble is to realize our smallness and need and look to Jesus for strength and help. I have found it easy to see myself as better than others, but this is pride for it is only in Jesus that we can live pleasing in God&#8217;s sight. When we are humble we can see ourselves and others as we are, not through an outlook of self righteousness.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+5%3A6" title="I&nbsp;Peter 5:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 5:6)</span></a></span>
</p>

<h2>Meekness</h2>
<p>Or &#8220;softness of temper, forbearance under injuries and provocation.&#8221;</p>

<p>This includes the qualities of gentleness, mildness, and submission that Jesus portrayed as the Lamb of God. It is by meekness that we don&#8217;t strive and quarrel with one another, and let go and let God do His part. In ourselves this is hard, but
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+5%3A24" title="I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:24)</span></a></span>
</p>

<h2>Long-suffering</h2>
<p>Or &#8220;the endurance of injuries for a long time with patience.&#8221;</p>

<p>To put on the spirit of longsuffering is to bear suffering with calmness, without murmuring or fretfulness. Each person has some habit or character trait that can get on our nerves, if we let it. But by God&#8217;s help we can stay sweet, even when someone is extremely provoking or bothersome. Long-suffering is only perfected through use.</p>

<h2>Forbearing One Another</h2>
<p>Or &#8220;the act of sparing or avoiding that which would hurt another and do that which would gratify him.&#8221;</p>

<p>I once read of the two &#8220;bears&#8221; that are needed for a loving home: Bear and Forbear. It is by these that little annoyances do not become plagues and the mole hills mountains. We bear up with another, and we forbear not to cause another grievance or trouble. This takes a setting of oneself to see through the other&#8217;s eyes and applying the Golden Rule.</p>

<h2>Forgiving One Another</h2>
<p>Or &#8220;the willingness to overlook offenses and to pardon another.&#8221;</p>

<p>God calls us to forgive
<span class="scripture">&#8220;as Christ forgave you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+3%3A13" title="Colossians 3:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 3:13)</span></a></span>
And our Savior forgave us while we were yet His enemies&#8212;what love! We need such a love also to forgive another and not hold a grudge in our heart against them, especially when we have been hurt deeply. Sometimes this takes stepping back and thinking what we have been forgiven. Put on the garment of forgiveness, and when you are asked if your offender needs punishment you can reply, &#8220;Not as far as I&#8217;m concerned.&#8221; Let us forgive and forget.</p>

<h2>Charity</h2>
<p>Or &#8220;the disposition of heart that thinks favorably of others to do them good.&#8221;</p>

<p>This Divine love is the selfless kind, and is truly a
<span class="scripture">&#8220;bond of perfectness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+3%3A14" title="Colossians 3:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 3:14)</span></a></span>
With charity in our hearts all other garments will be worn automatically, for
charity is all these and more (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+13">I&nbsp;Corinthians 13</a>).
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+13%3A13" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 13:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 13:13)</span></a></span>
</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>To be able to wear these &#8220;colors of our country,&#8221; we need strength and grace from God. Let us begin our day with drawing nigh to our Source of All Strength, calling upon Him for grace for the day. In doing so we will be prepared for whatever will come our way, for God has promised,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;As thy days, so shall your strength be.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+33%3A25" title="Deuteronomy 33:25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Deuteronomy 33:25)</span></a></span>
It is in starting out with the armor on and a closeness to our Savior that we can defeat every foe, triumph in the temptations, and come out of the battle an overcomer. Fight on, dear ones, and falter not, for with Jesus before us we will reach our Heavenly Home at last!</p>

<h1>True Love</h1>

<p class="author">Hannah L. Clayton</p>

<p>Illustrated by Laura Erickson</p>

<p>I gazed at the brilliant sun as it slowly disappeared, its lovely rays in vibrant colors as it rose to meet the other awakening side of the world. How wonderful God was to make this earth so beautiful. How He must have loved us to want to create something that He obviously know we would enjoy!</p>

<p>The last rays of the sun were disappearing, so quickening my steps, I walked in the direction of home, not wanting to be caught by the darkness that spreads itself so quickly over the sky. The crispness of fall was in the air and as I walked I could hear the leaves crackling under my feet, as the wind swished them about. As I walked homeward, the love of our Lord for us seemed to manifest itself everywhere to me. How great was His love for us! He created this whole earth for us to enjoy. For us, even though more often than not we take it for granted. He created a whole world for an ungrateful crew of people, of whom most don&#8217;t even acknowledge Him. Much less, believe that He created everything. And what did we do to deserve this magnificent gift? Nothing. There never could have been a more unworthy group of people. What did we do in return for this gift? Mocked His Son. Crucified Him. We could not have done something worse to show our ingratitude.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_6/love_walking.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="300" /></div>
<p>Yet He still loved us and continues to do so.</p>

<p>Our love to Him&#8212;how small it is to what it should be! How can we properly love God when He gives us everything and leaves nothing for us to do for Him? There is only one thing that He wants&#8212;one thing that we give to Him and He cannot take on His own&#8212;our life, our will, our heart, and our utter obedience and devotion and our true love.</p>

<p>True love. How beautiful it sounds! But what is true love and how do we express it? How do we express our true love not only to God, but our friends, neighbors, family?</p>

<p>We may say, &#8220;I love you,&#8221; to a family member, or to a dear friend. But do we truly love them like&#8230;&#8203;like God loves us?</p>

<p>In the gathering twilight I stood, watching as the sky darkened, the moon gracefully came to view and the stars became bright and twinkling.</p>

<p>Lord, what is the true definition of love?</p>

<p>My answer seemed to come from watching His handiwork&#8212;how did He love us? He gave us His life, His time, He created an earth for enjoyment, He bore with us, and He never has failed in anyway&#8212;even when we turned against Him.</p>

<p>And then as I stood there in the dusk listening to the frogs croak and the crickets chirp, His answer came more fully,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;[Love] suffereth long, and is kind&#8230;&#8203;envieth not&#8230;&#8203;vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things&#8230;. never faileth&#8230;.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+13%3A4-8" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 13:4-8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 13:4-8)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Lord, is all that really the meaning of love? Does love really show all that?</p>

<p>A mental image of His love came before me, and, yes, He has loved us like that.</p>

<p>There in the stillness, I realized what love God would have us show to everyone&#8212;the love He has given to me. May I share what I learned with you?</p>

<p>The first identification of love is to suffer long and be kind. Do I suffer long with my siblings when they get into my things and ruin something I treasure? Do I suffer long when my mother is tired and speaks sharply to me for something I accidentally did? My heart tells me to be honest and I know that is not the case. I am more inclined to speak sharply to my siblings and be angry with them than to suffer long and be kind. I am more likely to be resentful to my mother than to suffer long and realize that she is tired.</p>

<p>&#8220;<b>But, Lord</b>, how can I love her enough to suffer long and be kind?&#8212;I get irritated when she starts to speak!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a sin not to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Lord, I don&#8217;t have the strength to love like that! You were perfect because you were a Heavenly child. I&#8217;m not!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220; <span class="scripture">&#8216;Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+5%3A48" title="Matthew 5:48"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 5:48)</span></a></span>&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<p>The rebuke was heard so clearly that I first thought it had been spoken out loud. Then pink color rushed to my face as I realized I had been arguing with the Lord.</p>

<p>Love &#8220;envieth not&#8221; is the second. Am I always happy for someone else when they get just what I had wanted for years? To envy someone is not to love them properly.</p>

<p>Love &#8220;vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.&#8221; Pride. No, when I am feeling proud I am not loving like I ought. How easy it is to get &#8220;puffed up&#8221;! But we are nothing&#8212;God has given us what we have and are.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own,&#8221; is the fourth, and I sigh as I realize how short I come to not seeking my own pleasures and looking for others instead. It is very natural to want comfort for ourselves and for things to go our way. But however natural it may be, it has to go if we want to love the way the Lord wants us to. How (seemingly) hard it is to not look after things that interest ourselves and focus on others! Lord, help us to have real love for others and to be happy with them even though we would prefer doing something else.</p>

<p>Next comes to mind the phrase, &#8220;is not easily provoked.&#8221; Perhaps in some cases (mine, as well), that is one of the hardest things to do. Not getting easily provoked at someone or something that I&#8217;ve struggled with for a long time and won&#8217;t even pretend to have totally conquered. Yet, if we truly love someone, like God loves us, we won&#8217;t be easily provoked by them.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_6/love_cutting.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="250" /></div>
<p>Love &#8220;endureth <i>all things</i>.&#8221; What? How can this be? Does God really have grace for me to love my little sister who cut two big holes in a cross-stitch that took two years to complete?! Yes, He does. He loved the Jews when they were crucifying Him on the cross. How small a cut-up cross-stitch sampler compares! If He loved them, can not I find grace in my heart to love her?</p>

<p>I once thought that it was not a difficult thing to think &#8220;no evil,&#8221; which Brother Paul tells us is another thing that love does not do.</p>

<p>I thought that until about a week ago, when I came upon a book, <i>A Devotee and a Darling</i>, by Becca Middleton Swanson. (A book that is unfortunately out of print, but that I would very much recommend!) In this book, there is a young woman, Judith, who leaves her land and home and goes as an invited guest to a family that she knew as a little child. Almost all the family members are extremely irritating to be around, but Judith loved them. She loved them as God tells us to love. She could find the good in anybody and she absolutely refused, even in her own thoughts to think anything &#8220;evil&#8221; or down-grading about them. She honestly considered everybody above herself and always picked out the good, and left the rest, as none of her business to talk or think about or even have as information in the back of her head. After I read that book, I realized what thinking &#8220;evil&#8221; really is, and unfortunately, I&#8217;m afraid we do it all too often. How do rumors get started? How does feelings get hurt? It would all be avoidable if we truly loved that person and thought no &#8220;evil&#8221; about them. Dear sisters, is not speculating why you think someone did such and such, &#8220;thinking evil&#8221;? Or that maybe they are upset at you just because they had to rush out the door for some reason? Love thinketh <i>no</i> evil. With God&#8217;s help look through them with love-colored glasses. You don&#8217;t need to see or dwell or point out their faults. The Lord is quite capable of doing that. (You have your own to deal with anyway.) The last identification comes to my mind: love &#8220;never fails.&#8221; <i>Never</i> fails?! Oh, Lord, help me! Again my heart sank as I realized the tremendous depth of love God would have us have. <i>Lord</i>! How can I never fail in my love for even the dearest friend or family member?</p>

<p>Not too long ago the Lord put me through a trial that required His grace for me to love a certain person&#8212;someone who had been very dear to me, a true friend. But I was in a situation where I found myself so unloving that it scared me. Without Him, my love would have most certainly failed for her.</p>

<p>And so I found what I wanted&#8212;what true love is.</p>

<p>But now&#8212;how can I reach that level of love? &#8220;Oh, Lord how can I do this?&#8221; my heart cries. &#8220;I know I cannot in my own strength.&#8221;</p>

<p>His answer comes quickly, &#8220;Love Me, with all your heart, mind, and soul, and I will do the rest. I will put My love in you.&#8221; And as I stood contemplating the answer and promise I had just received, it dawned on me how absolutely true that it was. Yes, of course, if I put all I had on Jesus, He has promised to give me all that I need and I surely need love to be able to love people!</p>

<p>And so I found more than I wanted to know&#8212;what true love is and also how to obtain it.</p>

<p>Keep a burning love and desire for God in your hearts, my dear sisters, and being loving to family, friends, neighbors and who all you meet, will come naturally.</p>

<h1>The Gift of Conversation</h1>

<p>The early morning stillness was unbroken but for the steady rhythm of the Miller&#8217;s van tires, and an occasional early-bird vacationer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what the people will be like at this church,&#8221; Lorissa thought out loud, after being reminded of their destination by a sign for the town to which they were going. &#8220;I hope they&#8217;ll be friendly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sure every thing will be fine,&#8221; Father spoke for the driver&#8217;s seat. &#8220;Mother and I were here once before, and the adults were very kind. I imagine the children would be the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;I surely hope so. Especially since we&#8217;re thinking about moving here.&#8221;</p>

<p>After some time, Carl exclaimed, &#8220;We&#8217;re here!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lorissa unbuckled her one-year-old baby brother, lifted him from his car seat, and waited for the rest of the family to get out. Glancing with interest at her surroundings, she saw a girl of about her age jump from the black van which had followed them into the parking lot.</p>

<p>Being fairly outgoing, Lorissa smiled and waved.</p>

<p>The girl smiled wanly, and disappeared behind her van.</p>

<p><i>What?!</i> Lorissa thought with surprise, following her family toward the church, <i>I hope the other girls aren&#8217;t like that.</i></p>

<p>In time the service was over, and Lorissa looked around hopefully for the girls that had been in her Sunday school class. Seeing a group of them toward the back, she notified her mother as to where she was going, and headed in that direction.</p>

<p>As she neared the group, a few of the girls glanced in her direction, but made no move to welcome her.</p>

<p><i>That&#8217;s strange,</i> Lorissa thought, hesitating. <i>Don&#8217;t they greet visitors? Maybe they were looking at something else, and didn&#8217;t see me.</i> With this encouraging thought, she slipped into the group, in a place where she would easily be noticed.</p>

<p>She waited a minute, sure that they would at least acknowledge her presence. A few looked up, mumbled a weak &#8220;Hi,&#8221; and continued to talk among themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did Steve tell your brother about that .22 he bought last week?&#8221; she happened to hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Did he really?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been saving up for the past year or two. Yesterday he hunted coons out in our forest, but didn&#8217;t get anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see.&#8221; Then all was quiet until one girl had to leave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, bye, Mabel. See ya tonight.&#8221; Then silence reigned again.</p>

<p>Finally Lorissa, tired of the quiet, ventured to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; she greeted the nearest girl, &#8220;My name&#8217;s Lorissa. What&#8217;s yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Amy,&#8221; came the barely audible reply. Then silence.</p>

<p>Mustering her courage which was fast ebbing away, Lorrisa tried again. &#8220;My family is thinking about moving here, and I&#8217;ve been wondering how close the families live to the church. At our church they&#8217;re spread out over quite a distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amy stirred herself, stretched her arms in a semi-embarrassed motion, and replied, &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure. Maybe five miles. I guess I never really thought about it.&#8221; She ended with a small smile.</p>

<p><i>Little progress, if any, to be sure,</i> Lorissa thought ruefully. <i>I certainly wouldn&#8217;t want to live here. I&#8217;d have to start a speech revival, or something. Maybe I just picked the wrong person to talk to.</i></p>

<p>Making her way toward the other side of the circle of girls, she happened to glance in the direction of where her family had sat. Her mother was engaged in a conversation with perhaps three other sisters, and, yes, her father had found someone with whom to speak, but her two middle siblings were wandering forlornly about, and Carl was standing, as she had done at first, on the outskirts of a group of boys, having received perhaps less response than she.</p>

<p>Doubly disheartened, Lorissa scraped the last of her courage together, and addressed another girl, changing her tactics slightly, for fear she had been a bit too forward the previous time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; she said, trying to sound as positive as she could.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another monosyllabic reply. How could they stand it to sound so uninterested? <i>What more is there to try?</i> Lorissa thought to herself. <i>Nothing, that I can think of. I wonder what the women are talking about? I&#8217;m sure it would be better than nothing.</i> She smiled ruefully, and, in accordance with her thoughts, headed off in the direction of her mother.</p>

<p>Arriving at her mother&#8217;s side a few moments later, Lorissa saw her glance surprisedly in Lorissa&#8217;s direction. But then, one of the women asked Mother a question, and the unspoken subject was dropped for the time.</p>

<p>After a brief time, Lorissa heard her Father&#8217;s voice, and jolted herself from her daydream (the women&#8217;s conversation had turned out not to apply to girls).</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been invited to the Marlin Hershbergers for dinner, and they left a while ago,&#8221; Father announced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s nice,&#8221; Mother replied, &#8220;I guess we&#8217;d better be going then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If now&#8217;s a good time for you to leave.&#8221; Seeing Mother&#8217;s nod, Father relieved her arms of the sleeping one year old and carried him to the car. Lorissa followed, and was surprised at first to find Carl all ready there, for at their home church, he was usually the last one to arrive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, did all the boys leave?&#8221; Father inquired of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8230;&#8203;I guess they just weren&#8217;t the talking sort,&#8221; Carl replied, &#8220;So I came out here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were the girls that way, too?&#8221; Father directed the question at Lorissa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it seemed that way. That&#8217;s why I was standing near Mom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hmm&#8230;&#8203;well, get in the van. We&#8217;ll have to talk about this later.&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently Mother reached the vehicle, and they were soon headed toward the Hershbergers&#8217;. In a few minutes they had arrived, and Marlin hurried out to ask them in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dinner&#8217;s not quite ready, so why don&#8217;t you all come into the living room to visit awhile,&#8221; he invited. &#8220;Marla&#8217;s in the kitchen.&#8221; He directed the last statement to Mother as they neared the front door.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_6/conversation_girl.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="250" /></div>
<p>Lorrisa followed her mother to the kitchen and was soon put to work preparing a salad with several younger girls.</p>

<p>After a few moments of silence, Mother spoke. &#8220;Would you happen to have any girls around Lorrisa&#8217;s age? She&#8217;ll be fourteen next May.&#8221;</p>

<p>[Missing text.]</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;ll be nice for you,&#8221; Mother commented to her daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;That remains to be seen,&#8221; Lorrisa quickly mouthed to her mother. &#8220;I surely hope so.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment a girl, whom Lorrisa took to be Karen, slowly descended the stairs, passed Lorrisa without a word, and gained her mother&#8217;s side. In a moment she was gone again, through a door which Lorrisa decided led to the basement. <i>Well,</i> Lorrisa thought, meeting Mother&#8217;s eyes with a &#8220;that&#8217;s what I meant&#8221; look, <i>I guess that&#8217;s all I expected anyway; but it would be nice to get a proper greeting.</i> The girl was back again quickly, and this time Lorrisa undertook to make the first move.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi,&#8221; she began, &#8220;Are you Karen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Um-hum,&#8221; came a reply similar to what Lorrisa had come to expect. Karen began peeling some apples she had brought up from the basement, and said nothing more.</p>

<p>A few minutes passed in which silence was king, besides the scrape of peelers of vegetables, and an occasional comment from one of the women. Then Lorrisa heard the crunching of tires of gravel, and looked out the window besides which she was stationed. A wood-grain station wagon had pulled into the Hershbergers&#8217; driveway, and out piled four children and two adults.</p>

<p><i>Good,</i> thought Lorrisa, <i>That one girl looks about my age. Of course, based on my other experiences here, I shouldn&#8217;t get my hopes too high.</i></p>

<p>Marla ran out to greet the family and it soon grew evident that they must be either relatives or close friends of the Hershbergers. The wife and her two daughters soon reached the kitchen, escorted by MarIa, who introduced them thus:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my cousin Jane, and her two daughters, Eliza, 15, and Lydia, 10. They&#8217;re on a trip to Oregon. I don&#8217;t suppose you&#8217;ve met?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, actually, we haven&#8217;t,&#8221; Mother replied, and then addressed Jane. &#8220;Have you come a long way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just about five hundred miles so far,&#8221; Jane replied. &#8220;We started last Wednesday, but we&#8217;ve been trying to see as many interesting sites as possible, so we&#8217;ve been stopping a lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Watching to see if a second cousin would get the same reception as she had, Lorissa saw Karen approach Eliza with a &#8220;Hello,&#8221; and the conversation virtually stopped there. Taking the opportunity to find out what Eliza was like, Lorissa approached her with a smile and a cheerful greeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; came the pleasant response, &#8220;What&#8217;s your name? I suppose you heard mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uh, Lorrisa,&#8221; she stumbled, not prepared for the reply she had received.</p>

<p>After a few moments of silence, during which Lorissa remained quiet, not exactly sure what she should say, Eliza spoke again, &#8220;How old are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirteen,&#8221; Lorissa replied, and, having regained her composure, began to add equal weight to the conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you enjoyed your trip so far?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s been one of the best I&#8217;ve had, Eliza answered. &#8220;I guess I enjoy sight-seeing a lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; Lorissa said. &#8220;What have you seen so far?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, most of the points along the Oregon Trail, like Independence Rock, Soda Springs, the remains of a few forts, and&#8230;&#8203;I don&#8217;t remember the rest. Actually, we&#8217;ve been trying to follow the trail, as best we can. It&#8217;s been very&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Girls, dinner&#8217;s on the table,&#8221; Eliza&#8217;s mother broke into their conversation. &#8220;Sorry to have to interrupt you, but we don&#8217;t want it to get cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; both girls acknowledged as they headed for the dining room. What a vast difference! Lorissa thanked God inwardly for sending someone to talk to. I never knew what a privilege it is to have someone to converse with&#8212;until now.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>In the passage of time dinner was over, and Lorissa headed for the kitchen with a stack of plates. She was soon commissioned to wash the dishes, with Eliza drying.</p>

<p>&#8220;To end that sentence I had started when we got called to dinner,&#8221; Eliza began again, &#8220;I was saying that the trip has been educational.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hmm. Have you been keeping a journal?&#8221; Lorissa asked. &#8220;It sounds like the kind of thing someone would write about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The three oldest children in our family have been,&#8221; Eliza responded. But I don&#8217;t think mine, at least, would make much of a book. I can show it to you when we&#8217;re done here, if you want to see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That <i>would</i> be interesting,&#8221; Lorissa replied, and the conversation continued on from there. In time, the dishes were done, and she wrung the dish rag and draped it over the bridge in the sink. Karen, who bad been putting the dishes away, started for the stairs. Eliza followed, so Lorissa, not knowing what else to do, followed. Reaching what appeared to be Karen&#8217;s room, Lorissa leaned against the dootjamb, waiting to see where Karen wanted her to sit, while Eliza, evidently more at home than Lorissa, went in and sat down on Karen&#8217;s bed. When she didn&#8217;t receive a welcome, Lorissa began to feel uncomfortable and soon went downstairs to sit with her mother.</p>

<p>Lorissa hadn&#8217;t been there long before Father notified Mother that they should start home.</p>

<p>After obtaining permission from Mother to get Eliza&#8217;s address, Lorissa mounted the stairs softly and peeked in the bedroom door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hi, Lorissa,&#8221; Eliza noticed her immediately, &#8220;For a while I was worried you weren&#8217;t coming back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, actually, we&#8217;re leaving soon, and I was wondering if you might like to be pen-pals?&#8221; Lorissa stated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d love that,&#8221; Eliza replied without hesitation. &#8220;I just lost one of my other ones.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can write your address on the back of this,&#8221; Lorissa handed Eliza a quarterly. &#8220;And here&#8217;s mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have another copy of my address if you&#8217;d like to write, too,&#8221; Lorissa addressed Karen as she waited for Eliza to finish writing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;d better not,&#8221; Karen made excuse. &#8220;I&#8217;m not very good at getting letters out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here you are,&#8221; Eliza handed the quarterly back with a genuine smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have a nice trip home, wherever it is. I guess I never asked you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We live in Pleasantville, about three hours away. Have a nice trip yourself. Bye, girls,&#8221; Lorissa called over her shoulder as she quickly descended the stairs.</p>

<p>Reaching the bottom, she thanked Marla for the meal and ran out to her waiting family.</p>

<p>The van was soon making its way towards home, and Lorissa settled down to an embroidery project and day-dreaming. The rest of the family began various other occupations, with Father at the wheel, and for a span of time no one spoke, aside from an occasional remark about the scenery.</p>

<p>At close of this silence, Father addressed Mother, &#8220;So, what were your impressions? Or, rather, did you enjoy yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; replied Mother, &#8220;Certainly. The women at Orange Grove were a little less outgoing than what I&#8217;m used to, but they also seemed very spiritual. How about you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The same, but Carl and Lorissa didn&#8217;t receive any welcome at all.&#8221; A look of half surprise and half remembrance crossed Mother&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Okay, so that was why you came back to stand by me, Lorissa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uh-huh. I don&#8217;t want to complain too much, but&#8230;&#8203;&#8221; came Lorissa&#8217;s reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you don&#8217;t,&#8221; Mother agreed. But we need to make a decision about moving there, so that kind of information is important. You say they didn&#8217;t even come up to say, &#8216;Hi&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8230;&#8203;yeah, I guess not,&#8221; Lorissa responded. &#8220;But maybe they&#8217;re just extra shy. Of course, they didn&#8217;t talk among themselves, either, except for maybe on short conversation, and greetings among themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same here,&#8221; agreed Carl, &#8220;I sure don&#8217;t want to move there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Actually, I kind of feel sorry for those girls,&#8221; Lorissa inserted. &#8220;Perhaps they just haven&#8217;t been taught how to treat visitors, and themselves. I&#8217;d be worried that I&#8217;d end up that way, too, if we moved there. It would be hard to be not forgetful to entertain strangers without the support of others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; commented Mother, &#8220;That would not do at all. We&#8217;re also commanded to be hospitable in. It doesn&#8217;t make sense to me why they are like that. I personally think children should be taught how to converse, but guess that&#8217;s just not how they do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t have to worry about moving right now,&#8221; Father added with a smile. &#8220;It sounds like we wouldn&#8217;t fit in very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; Lorissa said aloud, feeling vastly relieved. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be sure to teach my children how to talk.&#8221;</p>

<div class="blurb">
<p class="first">Note: Although we feel that choosing a church to fellowship with should not be totally decided by the friendliness of the people, this article was an eye-opener to us on how we look to new acquaintances. Many people do decide where to fellowship on the basis of how friendly the people are. Surely we do not want to come before God with the charge that we turned some people away, who might have been saved, by our reserved, unfriendly manner. Please don&#8217;t get us wrong; we don&#8217;t feel you should go chatter to them about everything. Young ladies, especially, need to always have a reserved manner that God would be pleased to have us wear.</p>

<p>Many times we may feel intimidated when meeting strangers&#8212;but what a different light it puts me in if I think of myself as someone who has the opportunity to either turn away or draw people to the Lord. By God&#8217;s grace, dear sisters, let us look to the Lord for a warm and gracious spirit to welcome others as God would&#8212;as He welcomes us.</p>

<p>I am reminded of how a smile, or a word in due season, can encourage the heart and bless others.  I have experienced many situations where I have smiled and said a &#8220;hello&#8221; to (especially) elderly folks, and it just seems to brighten up their face and make them feel loved. Oh, let us pray that we may have the loving, caring, friendly attitude that our Lord had!</p>

<h1>Forgetting and Reaching Forth</h1>

<p class="author">Skye Erickson</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+3%3A13-14" title="Philippians 3:13-14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 3:13-14)</span></a></span></p>

<p>The Lord encouraged me with this scripture when I was battling discouragement over the division in our extended family. While there are ones that are walking with the Lord, there are also family members that out-right profess atheism. My brothers aren&#8217;t particularly open to Christianity and many think we&#8217;ve gone off the deep end in fanaticism. Aunt Krista&#8217;s oldest brother&#8217;s marriage just crashed and he is now remarried to someone whom you could easily say has strange &#8220;spiritual&#8221; ideas. And then there is dear Grandpa, who is horrified that we have no plans to go to college and pursue high-class careers&#8230;.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth&#8230;&#8203;I press toward the mark.&#8221;</span>
One meaning of forget is &#8220;to leave behind.&#8221; To leave something is &#8220;to give over to another to control or act on.&#8221; Who better could we trust to take our burdens and cares than the Lord? Who loves us more than the God who sacrificed His own Son to die for us, that we might live? If you&#8217;re like me, you often grapple with letting go of your burdens, and tend to take things into your own hands and run on in your own strength. Oh, how far this is from the vision God wants to give us! Yet only by <i>His</i> strength, can we learn to forget those things and reach forth. May I share with you some of the very situations, which the Lord has called me to forget and reach forth for His promises?</p>

<p>Disturbing family troubles. We recently heard of a close family member whose getting into some trouble. Someone so close, so dear to me&#8230;. Why? Why does this all have to happen?</p>

<p>&#8220;Trust me; leave your burdens with me, my child. Don&#8217;t I always work for my ultimate glory?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leaving those things which are behind, I press toward the mark.</p>

<p>Friends of ours are going to see other close friends of ours. &#8220;It&#8217;s not fair, Lord!&#8221; I utter in broken accents, and His rebuke comes back softly, but clearly, &#8220;I know what is best for you. My thoughts and ways are way above your thoughts and ways.
<span class="scripture">&#8216;All things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A28" title="Romans 8:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 8:28)</span></a></span>&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<p>All of our family heirlooms are at stake&#8230;&#8203;Nana&#8217;s tea sets and china, the old furniture, the grandfather clock&#8230;&#8203;&#8220;<i>Lord</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth, I press toward the mark. &#8220;Forget them. After all, won&#8217;t they all perish in the end? You can bring nothing with you to Heaven, and none of these things will even compare to the crown and riches I will give to you in Heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Help me Lord, I am so frail.&#8221;</p>

<p>Close friends no longer wish to be friends because of disagreement. They wanted nothing else to do with us because we didn&#8217;t &#8220;agree to disagree.&#8221; We love them dearly and are sorry we can&#8217;t have unity of the Spirit. Leaving those things which are behind. &#8220;Cast them on Me and press on. Rejoice when you can suffer for My sake,&#8221; the Lord whispers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will there be someone for me, Lord?!&#8221; I find myself easily doubting about getting married, as there are no possible options around. Yet doesn&#8217;t God know? Doesn&#8217;t He care? Then the rebuke gently comes, &#8220;Give your doubts and desires over to Me, My child.
<span class="scripture">&#8216;Trust in the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+3%3A5" title="Proverbs 3:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 3:5)</span></a></span>&nbsp;&#8221;
Leaving those things in the Savior&#8217;s hands, and pressing on&#8230;.</p>

<p>God is so worthy of our trust, and wants our trust! He cares for us so much and so desires His little children to trust in Him and leave all their cares to His confidence. He yearns for us to leave and devote ourselves utterly to Him. It&#8217;s not easy to give up and die to self. Itis not easy to forget these things. It is easy to take on our problems and run on in our own strength, but if we do, we will only fail miserably! What precious blessings come to all whose have left all with Jesus; who trusts implicitly in His divine Will!</p>
