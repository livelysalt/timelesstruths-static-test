<h1>Daniel&#8217;s Disappointment</h1>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_6/disappointment_guide.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="128" /></div>
<p>It all began with the new bird guide Grandpa gave Daniel. The book was red with many photographs, maps, and descriptions. It was even set up so you could quickly find the bird just by its color.</p>

<p>When Grandpa suggested a bird hike, Daniel couldn&#8217;t have been more delighted. He began making plans: they would take binoculars, notepads, and a picnic lunch. Chad and Rosie would come. Grandpa said he knew just the place for good sightings in the nearby national forest. Everything was set for the first clear day next week.</p>

<p>Monday came. Daniel checked his window the minute he woke up&#8212;clear skies! Soon Grandpa would come driving up in his blue truck! Daniel hurried to see if the lunch was ready. &#8220;We&#8217;ve fixed tuna sandwiches and carrot sticks,&#8221; Rosie said as she wrapped the last sandwich.</p>

<p>Daniel hopped on one foot, twisting the handle on the bird whistle so that it let out a little shriek. <i>SqueeEET WEET tweet&#8212;Ring! Ring!</i></p>

<p>Irene covered her ears. &#8220;Oh, please be&#8212;the telephone!&#8221; Rosie and Daniel giggled as she dashed out of the room to answer it. In a minute she was back. &#8220;Grandpa said that he can&#8217;t take you today,&#8221; she said. Daniel and Rosie&#8217;s giggles disappeared. &#8220;His old school friends are visiting. He hopes you won&#8217;t feel too bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel bit his lip and turned away. All his plans were falling apart. He went to his room and stared glumly at the neatly-packed bag on his desk. Why did Grandpa&#8217;s old friends have to come <i>this</i> week? The day was ruined.</p>

<p>He flopped on his bed and stared at the wall.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And we know all things work together for good&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A28" title="Romans 8:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 8:28)</span></a></span>
stared back at him. Mom had hung the Bible verse there for a reminder. Daniel frowned. It sure didn&#8217;t look like everything was working for good today.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daniel!&#8221; It was Mother&#8217;s voice from the back porch. &#8220;We have work to do.&#8221; Although Daniel didn&#8217;t feel like working, he remembered Dad&#8217;s words: <i>If you decide to do it, half the work is already done.</i> Daniel made up his mind. Jumping off the bed, he went to find Mom.</p>

<p>&#8220;There you are,&#8221; Mom said with a smile. &#8220;Since it&#8217;s a perfect day for digging up the garden, Chad&#8217;s getting the tiller out. Why don&#8217;t you and Rosie help me set up the paths?&#8221; Daniel took the gloves Mom handed him and got his boots.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_6/disappointment_swallows.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="322" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Rosie,&#8221; he said, trying to be cheerful. &#8220;We&#8217;ll pretend we&#8217;re pioneers on the prairie.&#8221; As they worked, he listened to the twittering swallows on the telephone line. Daniel whistled back to them. He was going to make his work fun, even if his plans had been wrecked.</p>

<p>It was shortly after lunch when a blue truck pulled into the drive. &#8220;Oh!&#8221; little Emma squealed, &#8220;Grandpa&#8217;s here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it looks like he&#8217;s brought his friends,&#8221; Mom added as a gray-haired man and lady climbed out. &#8220;Remember to shake hands and greet them nicely,&#8221; she said, and went to open the door.</p>

<p>Daniel didn&#8217;t feel like meeting Grandpa&#8217;s friends, but he managed to smile when Mother said, &#8220;And here is my second son, Daniel.&#8221; As they sat around in the living room, Grandpa told his friends all about them. Daniel squirmed and wished he could be outside.</p>

<p>Looking out the window, he saw a blue bird fly up into a tree. Daniel remembered his new bird guide and hopped off his chair. In a second he was back and flipping through the blue section.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you have there?&#8221; said a voice at his elbow. Daniel looked up quickly to see Grandpa&#8217;s friend, Mr. Harris, smiling at him.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_6/disappointment_window.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="258" /></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bird guide Grandpa gave me,&#8221; Daniel said in a small voice. &#8220;I was just looking up a bird I saw outside.&#8221; He was surprised when the gray-haired man laughed. Daniel didn&#8217;t feel like being laughed at.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your grandpa told us all about the bird hike you missed,&#8221; Mr. Harris said. &#8220;But did you know I love to study birds myself?&#8221; The old man&#8217;s eyes twinkled as he watched the bird in the tree. &#8220;If I remember rightly, that is a mountain bluebird.&#8221; Daniel found the photo for it and was surprised to see that the old man was right.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; he remembered to say, and asked, &#8220;Do you study birds very much?&#8221; So Mr. Harris began telling about his bird-watching hobby and the bird club in his woods. Daniel enjoyed hearing about the adventures they had had. All too soon, Mrs. Harris suggested that they be heading back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Daniel,&#8221; Mr. Harris said, &#8220;before I leave I want to say that you are all welcome to come to our place sometime. We live up in the mountains where there are many good trails for bird hikes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Mrs. Harris said. &#8220;Andthere is plenty of room. We have a little cabin for visitors, so consider making it a vacation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother said, &#8220;That is very kind of you. I will be sure to tell my husband.&#8221; She looked across the room at Daniel, who couldn&#8217;t hide his wide grin. &#8220;I know at least one boy who is interested,&#8221; she told the Harrises, as they stepped out the door.</p>
