<h1>Daniel&#8217;s Disappointment</h1>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_6/disappointment_guide.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="128" /></div>
<p>It all began with the new bird guide Grandpa gave Daniel. The book was red with many photographs, maps, and descriptions. It was even set up so you could quickly find the bird just by its color.</p>

<p>When Grandpa suggested a bird hike, Daniel couldn&#8217;t have been more delighted. He began making plans: they would take binoculars, notepads, and a picnic lunch. Chad and Rosie would come. Grandpa said he knew just the place for good sightings in the nearby national forest. Everything was set for the first clear day next week.</p>

<p>Monday came. Daniel checked his window the minute he woke up&#8212;clear skies! Soon Grandpa would come driving up in his blue truck! Daniel hurried to see if the lunch was ready. &#8220;We&#8217;ve fixed tuna sandwiches and carrot sticks,&#8221; Rosie said as she wrapped the last sandwich.</p>

<p>Daniel hopped on one foot, twisting the handle on the bird whistle so that it let out a little shriek. <i>SqueeEET WEET tweet&#8212;Ring! Ring!</i></p>

<p>Irene covered her ears. &#8220;Oh, please be&#8212;the telephone!&#8221; Rosie and Daniel giggled as she dashed out of the room to answer it. In a minute she was back. &#8220;Grandpa said that he can&#8217;t take you today,&#8221; she said. Daniel and Rosie&#8217;s giggles disappeared. &#8220;His old school friends are visiting. He hopes you won&#8217;t feel too bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel bit his lip and turned away. All his plans were falling apart. He went to his room and stared glumly at the neatly-packed bag on his desk. Why did Grandpa&#8217;s old friends have to come <i>this</i> week? The day was ruined.</p>

<p>He flopped on his bed and stared at the wall.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And we know all things work together for good&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A28" title="Romans 8:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 8:28)</span></a></span>
stared back at him. Mom had hung the Bible verse there for a reminder. Daniel frowned. It sure didn&#8217;t look like everything was working for good today.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daniel!&#8221; It was Mother&#8217;s voice from the back porch. &#8220;We have work to do.&#8221; Although Daniel didn&#8217;t feel like working, he remembered Dad&#8217;s words: <i>If you decide to do it, half the work is already done.</i> Daniel made up his mind. Jumping off the bed, he went to find Mom.</p>

<p>&#8220;There you are,&#8221; Mom said with a smile. &#8220;Since it&#8217;s a perfect day for digging up the garden, Chad&#8217;s getting the tiller out. Why don&#8217;t you and Rosie help me set up the paths?&#8221; Daniel took the gloves Mom handed him and got his boots.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_6/disappointment_swallows.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="322" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Rosie,&#8221; he said, trying to be cheerful. &#8220;We&#8217;ll pretend we&#8217;re pioneers on the prairie.&#8221; As they worked, he listened to the twittering swallows on the telephone line. Daniel whistled back to them. He was going to make his work fun, even if his plans had been wrecked.</p>

<p>It was shortly after lunch when a blue truck pulled into the drive. &#8220;Oh!&#8221; little Emma squealed, &#8220;Grandpa&#8217;s here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it looks like he&#8217;s brought his friends,&#8221; Mom added as a gray-haired man and lady climbed out. &#8220;Remember to shake hands and greet them nicely,&#8221; she said, and went to open the door.</p>

<p>Daniel didn&#8217;t feel like meeting Grandpa&#8217;s friends, but he managed to smile when Mother said, &#8220;And here is my second son, Daniel.&#8221; As they sat around in the living room, Grandpa told his friends all about them. Daniel squirmed and wished he could be outside.</p>

<p>Looking out the window, he saw a blue bird fly up into a tree. Daniel remembered his new bird guide and hopped off his chair. In a second he was back and flipping through the blue section.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you have there?&#8221; said a voice at his elbow. Daniel looked up quickly to see Grandpa&#8217;s friend, Mr. Harris, smiling at him.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_6/disappointment_window.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="258" /></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bird guide Grandpa gave me,&#8221; Daniel said in a small voice. &#8220;I was just looking up a bird I saw outside.&#8221; He was surprised when the gray-haired man laughed. Daniel didn&#8217;t feel like being laughed at.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your grandpa told us all about the bird hike you missed,&#8221; Mr. Harris said. &#8220;But did you know I love to study birds myself?&#8221; The old man&#8217;s eyes twinkled as he watched the bird in the tree. &#8220;If I remember rightly, that is a mountain bluebird.&#8221; Daniel found the photo for it and was surprised to see that the old man was right.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; he remembered to say, and asked, &#8220;Do you study birds very much?&#8221; So Mr. Harris began telling about his bird-watching hobby and the bird club in his woods. Daniel enjoyed hearing about the adventures they had had. All too soon, Mrs. Harris suggested that they be heading back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Daniel,&#8221; Mr. Harris said, &#8220;before I leave I want to say that you are all welcome to come to our place sometime. We live up in the mountains where there are many good trails for bird hikes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Mrs. Harris said. &#8220;Andthere is plenty of room. We have a little cabin for visitors, so consider making it a vacation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother said, &#8220;That is very kind of you. I will be sure to tell my husband.&#8221; She looked across the room at Daniel, who couldn&#8217;t hide his wide grin. &#8220;I know at least one boy who is interested,&#8221; she told the Harrises, as they stepped out the door.</p>

<h1>The Best Way</h1>

<p>Have you ever thought of what will happen if you do right? What if you do wrong? The Bible tells us that God will reward us for the way we live. Have you ever gotten a reward for doing something? Maybe you did a good job in your school lesson and you got a hug or a sticker. When your father works, he gets paid for it. If you obey and help your mother, she smiles and is glad. But if you disobey, your reward is not a happy one. No one likes to be punished, do they?</p>

<p>The Lord says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+7%3A23" title="Jeremiah 7:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jeremiah 7:23)</span></a></span>
The Bible is full of promises of what God will do if we obey Him and do right. He has told us that He will take care of us and we will have happiness and a home in heaven. It also says that those that do wrong will be punished and will have much trouble. Don&#8217;t you think that obeying God is the best way?</p>

<p>Sometimes God&#8217;s way seems to be the hardest way. It is hard to give up what we want to make someone else happy. It is hard to do what is right when others do what is wrong. It is hard to be kind to someone that is mean. And some days we will have troubles and disappointments, like Daniel had. When he chose to be cheerful anyway, God helped him. If we ask God to help us do what is right, it always turns out best in the end. Maybe it doesn&#8217;t seem to be the best way at first. But just trust God, and He will work everything together for our good.</p>

<p>When the day seems gloomy or you feel cross, go to Jesus. If He has given you a clean heart, you will find that He is always there to help you. Take every trouble to Jesus and ask for His cheerfulness and love. When we follow God&#8217;s way and do what is right, God will reward us. He gives us love and joy. He hears us when we pray and helps us. He takes care of us and shows us the right way. And if we will continue to do right until we die, we are promised a happy home with Him.</p>

<p>You will see many people do wrong and disobey God. Many times it does not seem like they have troubles or problems. But we know that in the end they won&#8217;t have peace or happiness. God has promised to punish those that don&#8217;t follow His way. Always remember that you will be rewarded for how you live. God sees everyone, if they are obeying Him or not. Choose God&#8217;s best way.</p>

<h1>Your Garden Soil</h1>

<p>Now it is time to be digging up your garden plot. One of the most important things to have in a garden is soft fluffy soil, so plant roots can grow well. Roots are a very special part of the plant. They suck up water and nutrients (plant food) from the soil so that the plant can grow. They also keep the plant from falling over. If the soil is bad, the roots don&#8217;t grow well. Then the plant doesn&#8217;t grow well either.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_6/garden_soils.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="158" /></div>
<p>There are many kinds of soil. Ground that is rocky doesn&#8217;t have much soil for roots to grow in. Sandy soil is soft and light, but it doesn&#8217;t have nutrients in it. It also dries out quickly, so the plant has a hard time getting water. Clay soil is opposite of sandy soil. Have you ever played with clay before? It sticks together and it gets hard when it is dry. That is the same way with clay soil, but it does have many nutrients in it. It also holds water for a long time.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_6/garden_composter.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="230" /></div>
<p>Good soft soil is made when plants and other things die and decompose. That means they fall apart and turn into dark fluffy dirt. When leaves fall from trees and plants die in the autumn, it is the special way God set up so new plants could grow. It takes several years for this good soil to be made. Gardeners like to make their own good soil, called compost, to add to their gardens. They mix old leaves, cut grass or straw, vegetable peels and other kitchen scraps together. If animal manure is added, or everything is chopped into small pieces, the compost is made faster. When compost is mixed with other soil, the soil gets fluffier and softer: just right for those plant roots.</p>

<p>In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+8%3A5-15">Luke 8:5-15</a> Jesus tells a parable about different kinds of soil. God wants us to be like the good soil. He wants our hearts to be soft and willing to obey. But first Jesus has to give us a new heart, because everyone starts out with a hard selfish one. Soft hearts obey the Bible and do what is right. Do you know that God wants your heart to be like a garden full of fruit? The kind of fruit that He wants to grow in us is love, joy, kindness, gentleness, and many other good things. These can only grow in hearts that are letting Jesus have His way.</p>

<p></p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_6/garden_square.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="240" /></div>
<p>For your own little garden plot, dig up the soil in a 4-foot by 4-foot square. Add compost to your soil to make it fluffy and soft. Put wide boards around the edges for path ways. Now plant the tomatoes and lettuce you started, as the picture shows. You can grow more plants in the extra space.</p>

<h2>Grow a Salad in a Pot</h2>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have room for a garden plot, you can still grow your own little garden. This garden will have salad things in it, so you will need lettuce, carrot, and cucumber seeds. You will also need two pots (2-5 gal.) and compost or potting soil.</p>

<p>Dampen the soil with water and fill the pots. Each pot should have bottom holes for water to drain out. A round tray can be put underneath to hold the extra water.</p>

<p>Now mix together a pinch of lettuce seed and a pinch of carrot seed. Sprinkle these seeds all over the soil in one pot. Sprinkle a little bit of soil over the top and pat it down. This is your salad pot. Put it where it will have some sunshine.</p>

<p>In your other pot plant 4 cucumber seeds. Poke them into the soil up to the top of your fingernail and cover with soil. This pot should have sunshine all the time. You can also use another pot for a tomato plant. Put it in the sunshine with a cage around it, so that it won&#8217;t fall over.</p>

<p>Sprinkle the pots with water every day until the sprouts come up. Then be sure to water them well if they start to get dry. Fill the trays with water and they will suck it up through their roots.</p>

<p>Start picking lettuce when it is 6 inches high. If you pick only the big leaves, they will keep growing more. Carrots can be picked when the top of the root is as round as your finger. Pick cucumbers and tomatoes when the fruit is ripe. Remember to thank God for making your salad grow!</p>

<p>&#8220;Today I will tell you about a man named Obadiah,&#8221; said Grandpa. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know if he had a family, but we will pretend he did. His children shall be Betty and Jonas. The story is called,</p>

<h1>When There Was No Rain</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Kings+18">I&nbsp;Kings 18</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Betty and Jonas lived with their family in the land of Israel. They loved God and obeyed Him. Their father, Obadiah, worked in the king&#8217;s palace. He was a good man, but his job was not a fun one. The king and queen of the land were very wicked. Instead of obeying God, they served a stone idol called Baal. King Ahab built a house for Baal and told all the people to worship it. Queen Jezebel was even more wicked. She wanted to kill all the prophets of the true God.</p>

<p>In Betty and Jonas&#8217;s home, their father taught them to love God and to pray to Him. All their neighbors prayed to Baal, but Betty and Jonas knew he was not real. Once their father, Obadiah, helped the prophets of God. When the queen planned to kill them, he hid one hundred of them in some caves. Betty and Jonas helped take bread and water to them. It was a very dangerous thing to do, but they trusted God to take care of them.</p>

<p>Then something dreadful happened. There was no rain for days and days. The grass got brown and died. Still it did not rain, and the brooks got dry and the animals began to die. A prophet of God had come to king Ahab and told him that there would be no dew or rain. &#8220;How can we live without water?&#8221; Jonas asked his father. &#8220;We will trust God,&#8221; he said. Betty helped her mother hunt for firewood. Jonas walked all the way to the river to bring jugs of water. They prayed and waited.</p>

<p>Ever since the prophet Elijah had come, King Ahab had searched everywhere to find him. The king got angrier and angrier. The prophet had just disappeared, and now the whole land was drying up and the people were starving. King Ahab called Obadiah and made plans to take the animals out to find water somewhere. Betty and Jonas were very sad to see their father go, for he would be gone many days. Again they prayed that God would help and take care of them.</p>

<p>When their father came home, how glad they were! He had good news to tell. He had met prophet Elijah on the road, and the king had come and talked to him. They were going to have a big meeting on Mount Carmel.</p>

<p>It was not long until everyone was gathered on the mountain. Betty and Jonas were excited as they stood in the crowds and listened as the prophet spoke. &#8220;How long will you wait to choose? If the Lord is God, follow Him, but if Baal is, then follow him.&#8221; Everyone watched the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal make an alter and pray to him. Prophet Elijah said that the God who sent fire was the real God. All day the Baal-followers yelled and cut themselves, but nothing happened.</p>

<p>At evening the prophet of God built an alter of stones, put wood on it, and told men to pour water over it. When the prophet prayed to the Lord of Heaven, a great fire came down a burnt all of the alter and water up! &#8220;The Lord, He is God!&#8221; the people shouted. So the prophets of Baal were killed, and that same day God sent rain.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>When Grandpa finished the story he asked, &#8220;How do you think Betty and Jonas felt at the end?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were probably very glad,&#8221; said Alice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, &#8217;cause now there was rain again,&#8221; said Sammy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think it must have been hard to just wait and trust God those three years?&#8221; asked Grandpa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; said Edward. &#8220;Because nothing was happening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe their animals died and they were sad,&#8221; suggested Sammy.</p>

<p>&#8220;They could have thought that it wasn&#8217;t any use following God,&#8221; said Alice. &#8220;But they did anyway, although they had lots of troubles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then God sent the fire and rain,&#8221; said Sammy.</p>

<p>Grandpa smiled, &#8220;Yes, and we need to trust Him like that when we have troubles. God is real, and He does take care of those that obey Him.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>


<h1>The Stolen Candy</h1>

<p>Children in India love sweets, just like you. But people in India do not have things to eat like we do. They make their food spicy with hot peppers, and sometimes make an ice drink with peppers, too. Sweet things were a special treat for Mama Stewart&#8217;s girls.</p>

<p>One day a kind friend brought some candy for all the people at the Girls&#8217; Home. The girls could hardly wait as the treat was divided up. When everyone had gotten their share, the helpers&#8217; candy was left on a plate until they were ready to eat it. But later on, when they came to get it, the candy was gone!</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_6/candy_plate.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="62" /></div>
<p>All the girls were asked about the missing candy. One by one, they each said that they hadn&#8217;t taken it. So what could they do? &#8220;We&#8217;ll just have to let the Lord work it out,&#8221; Mama said at last.</p>

<p>The next day a strange thing happened. God had always taken care of them so that they always had food to eat, even during the hard times of the war. But now no money came in the mail and hardly any food was sent. There was a little rice for the babies to eat, but the older girls only had the rice water. Soon they were very hungry.</p>

<p>The next day it was the same way. Imagine not having any food for two days! The girls grew even hungrier. Maybe something will come tomorrow, they hoped. But nothing did.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_6/candy_girl.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="227" /></div>
<p>Mama wept when she saw how hungry they were. She gathered all the girls together to talk their trouble over. &#8220;But, Mama,&#8221; cried one of the girls, &#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t God send enough food for all of us? Why do only the babies have something to eat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Mama, &#8220;Unless someone has sinned and God is waiting for them to confess it and ask forgiveness.&#8221; She looked sadly around at all the girls and said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it was any of the babies that stole the candy. We must pray for God to help us, for this is a serious thing. We must have food.&#8221; The girls all sat very still when Mama spoke.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_6/candy_repentance.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="353" /></div>
<p>Suddenly one little, eight-year-old girl stood up in the back of the group. Past the other girls she came, right up to Mama. &#8220;Oh, it is me!&#8221; she said, sobbing and falling down at Mama&#8217;s feet. &#8220;I am the one who sinned. All my sisters are hungry because of what I&#8217;ve done!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you take the candy?&#8221; Mama asked her. &#8220;Did you eat it all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I took it, but I only ate one piece. I gave the rest to some of the other girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mama looked around the room. &#8220;Every girl who ate a piece of that candy, please raise your hand,&#8221; she said. Several girls held up their hands bravely. Together they all knelt down to cry and pray to God, for the wrong had to be made right. The girls who had sinned by taking the candy repented and asked the Lord to forgive them. When we are really sorry in our hearts for doing wrong, then the Lord is glad to forgive us, and everything can be made happy and right again.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_6/candy_letter.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="92" /></div>
<p>On that morning, when the postman came, he brought a letter. Do you know what was in it? Yes, it was the money they needed to buy food. How glad all the girls were when Mama showed it to them! Then they noticed something. The mark on the envelope showed that the letter had been waiting at the post office all those three days, while the girls had nothing to eat. God knew all about it, and had kept the money there until the wrong was made right. It was a lesson the girls would never forget.</p>

<h1>On Your Guard</h1>

<p class="noindent">To My Soldier:</p>

<p>When you tie a girdle around your waist you are ready to work for Me. The girdle I have for you is called Truth. How I made you and the world around you is Truth. It is what things really are, not what you pretend or what you just want to think. The Bible is Truth, because everything in it is true. When you love and obey the Bible, that is putting on Truth.</p>

<p>I hate lies, for that is not the Truth at all. You may think that a little lie is alright, but it isn&#8217;t. Honesty is telling only what is Truth, no matter if it is hard. Tell the Truth even if you will get into trouble or others won&#8217;t like you. In the end, Truth is what will last. It isn&#8217;t Truth anymore if only one lie is added.</p>

<p>Love the Truth. Be honest. If you have done something you shouldn&#8217;t, telling lies will only make it worse. I always hear the words you speak. Say what is True. I have never told a lie, and that means you can trust Me. I want you to be a trustworthy person, too.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t pretend you are better than you are. I see you and know your heart. It is the honest people that I can teach and help, because they love what is True. Wear the girdle of Truth today, and you will be glad because you did.</p>

<h2>Something You Can Do</h2>
<h1>A Beanbag Star</h1>

<p>Is it hard sometimes to find a good gift to give to your cousin or friend? A beanbag is fun to make and to play with, too. You can make them in many different shapes, but this pattern will be for a star beanbag. If you have learned to sew on the sewing machine, this will be easy for you. If you can&#8217;t sew well, ask someone to help you. Sewing takes patience, so be slow and careful. Read the instructions first, please.</p>

<p>You will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>tracing paper</li>

<li>pencil, pen, and ruler</li>

<li>scissors</li>

<li>2 fabric pieces, 7 inches square</li>

<li>thread and pins</li>

<li>sewing machine or needle</li>

<li>paper strip, 3/8-inch wide</li>

<li>small white or black beans</li>

</ul>
<ol>
<li>First print and cut out the <a href="../beanbag_star.pdf">star on this page</a>. It is your pattern.</li>

<li>Put the squares of fabric on top of each other. The pretty sides should be together in the inside.</li>

<li>Pin the star pattern on the fabrics in the very middle. Mark around it carefully with a pen. A ruler will help you keep the lines straight.</li>

<li>Unpin the pattern. Pin the fabrics together at the corners.</li>

<li>Start at one star point and sew straight along the lines. To turn a corner on a sewing machine, first poke the needle down to hold your place. Then lift up the presser foot and turn the fabric around. Don&#8217;t sew one of the edges, so the beans can be put in.</li>

<li>Line up the paper strip on the outside of all your stitching. Mark along the outside edge of the paper to know where to cut. Carefully cut around your star. Trim around the star points.</li>

<li>Turn the beanbag inside out through the hole. Use a pencil to poke out the star points.</li>

<li>Fill the star with beans. Pin together the hole and sew it shut with a needle and thread.</li>

<li>Beanbags are fun to play with others. Play toss, or &#8220;hide the beanbag.&#8221; Give them hints where it is by saying &#8220;hot&#8221; if they are getting close, or &#8220;cold&#8221; if they are not. When we share and make others happy, Jesus gives us happiness, too!</li>

</ol>

<h1>Jesus <b>Died</b> for You&#8212;Will You <b>Live</b> for Him?</h1>

<p>Read the song, &#8220;<a href="../../../music/Like_Jesus/index.html" title="Like Jesus">Like Jesus</a>.&#8221; In the chorus we sing about Jesus dying for us. On Resurrection Day we celebrate how Jesus died and rose again. Why did He do that? All of the people of the world are going to be judged by God one day. God hates evil, so only those that have lived right and have pure hearts can go to be with Him in Heaven. But since Adam and Eve disobeyed God, everyone has done wrong. The only way for us to be saved from punishment was for God&#8217;s Son, who never did wrong, to be punished <i>for us</i>.
So Jesus died, because God loved us and didn&#8217;t want us to perish&#8212;to go to hell (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+3%3A16">John 3:16</a>).
Now we can be saved, if we ask Jesus to forgive our sins and make us clean.</p>

<p>Jesus gave up His life and <i>died for you</i>. Now He asks, &#8220;Will you stop sinning and doing wrong? I love you and want to be your Friend. Will you live for Me?&#8221; Jesus will help us live for Him. And do you know? When we do right and love others, like Jesus does, we are telling the story. It is the story of how Jesus loves them and wants to save them, too.</p>

<h1><i>I&#8217;m</i> Not a Baby</h1>

<p>Jeff Ellison was seven-and-a-half years old&#8212;almost eight&#8212;and he was strong. He could pick up a whole bag of chicken feed by himself. He could read books all by himself, too. He had climbed the big birch tree in the backyard all the way to the top.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_6/baby_baby.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="158" /></div>
<p>His little brother, Tommy, was just a baby. He couldn&#8217;t even walk! Couldn&#8217;t hardly talk, either. All he did was cry! He cried about everything, especially in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>Tommy had to have a bottle, or he would spill his milk. Jeff drank out of a glass, carefully holding it just like Daddy did.</p>

<p>And Tommy didn&#8217;t even go to the bathroom. Oh, my! It was awful! He had to wear <i>diapers</i>. And he didn&#8217;t even seem to feel bad about it.</p>

<p>You couldn&#8217;t trust him at all, either. He crawled everywhere and put everything in his mouth. He had to be watched all the time. But he didn&#8217;t know better.</p>

<p>Sometimes Jeff would stand by Tommy&#8217;s playpen and show him the book that he was reading. He sure didn&#8217;t know anything: if you let him look at the book, he would try to tear out the pages!</p>

<p>Then Cousin Herb came to stay with the Ellisons for the summer. He was tall, almost as tall as Daddy. He could jump over the pasture fence just by putting one hand on the post. He could read the Bible in family devotions and knew how to say all the words. One day, when Jeff was showing Cousin Herb how he could lift a whole bag of chicken feed, Herb reached down and picked up Jeff <i>and</i> the chicken feed and put them in the back of the pickup truck!</p>

<p>Cousin Herb could do just about everything that Daddy could. They laughed together as they worked. My, they were strong!</p>

<p>Cousin Herb liked Jeff, too. When Jeff showed him how well he could read, Herb didn&#8217;t laugh, even when Jeff forgot the hardest words in the book. He didn&#8217;t even laugh when Jeff showed him how hard he could swing a hammer, and then missed the nail. When Jeff, Herb, and Daddy were all mixing concrete for fence posts, Jeff got so tired that he had to quit. Cousin Herb didn&#8217;t make fun of him, or say things like, &#8220;Wait till you grow up before you try a man&#8217;s work.&#8221; He just kept on working. But it bothered Jeff just the same.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_6/baby_fence.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="381" /></div>
<p>After a bit he said, &#8220;Well, I did better than Tommy could, anyway. He&#8217;s just a <i>baby</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cousin Herb looked at Jeff. The whole front of his shirt was wet with sweat. His face was shiny, too. Then he said, &#8220;Jeff, <i>I</i> used to be a baby, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jeff felt kind of strange all over, just like the time when he fell off the swing-set just as he had gone higher than he had ever gone before. He just stared at Cousin Herb.</p>

<p>Daddy glanced up from his work and looked straight at Jeff. &#8220;I was a baby, too,&#8221; he said. He looked at Cousin Herb and smiled. &#8220;And Jesus was a baby, at first.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a bit Daddy said, &#8220;When I was a baby, I enjoyed being one. But I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not a baby now&#8212;because this work wouldn&#8217;t get done!&#8221; And they all laughed together.</p>

<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Princess,</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_6/letter_broken.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="191" /></div>
<p>I am thinking of a very lovely princess. She is one of Princess Precious&#8217; best friends. Her name is Truthfulness, and the clothes she wears are shining silver. Everyone likes Princess Truthfulness and she has another best friend which is with her all the time&#8212;Princess Trustworthy. Princess Truthfulness and Princess Trustworthy are always together and everyone likes to be around them.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_6/letter_gate.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="222" /></div>
<p>Mother Matron knows that if Princess Truthfulness and Princess Trustworthy are in the house then she will know what <i>really</i> happened when a china lamp is lying broken on the floor. If you were in the house, would Mother Matron really know what happened? If not, then why don&#8217;t you ask King Jesus to give you pure, sweet, silver clothes of Truth? Then you could become a Princess Truthfulness, and you will never tell any lies. And do you know what? When you wear the silver clothes of Truth people can trust you, so you are a Princess Trustworthy, too!</p>

<p>I hope you ask King Jesus for clothes of Truth&#8212;for if you are going to be King Jesus&#8217; princess you must have them. He does not let any princess into Heaven&#8212;His royal Kingdom&#8212;who does not wear the pure, silver clothes of Truth.</p>
