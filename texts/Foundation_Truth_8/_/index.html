<h1>Editorial</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Readers,</p>

<p>Had any problems or troubles lately?</p>

<p>I trust that your answer to the question is yes&#8212;not because I wish ill to any of you, but because it is an essential part of life, and more particularly, the life of a child of God. Let us first consider a few scriptures on the part trials play in the life of God&#8217;s people.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Job+23%3A10" title="Job 23:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Job 23:10)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+17%3A3" title="Psalm 17:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 17:3)</span></a></span></p>

<p>In the midst of their trials both Job and David were inspired by this thought, that this was a test God allowed that <b>they could pass, and they intended to pass.</b> Let&#8217;s not waste too much energy on the details of their trials, and speculate how we would do in like situation. We all are different, and what is extremely difficult for one person to bear may be relatively easy for another, and the positions of the two people may be reversed in a different type of trial. The Lord knows how to test us, and gives us tests that challenge us but that <b>we can pass if we intend to pass</b> with His grace. Maybe it&#8217;s a better test for us to have to watch someone we love suffer, or maybe it&#8217;s a better test for us to suffer. Maybe it&#8217;s a better test for us to have a long string of &#8220;small&#8221; difficulties, or maybe it&#8217;s a better test for us to have a single, big one. In any case, whatever ill the devil intends for us and hurls our way, the Lord has the knowledge, skill and power to transform it by the time it reaches us to something that is a <b>good test</b> for us, that will also bring good results for us.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+66%3A10" title="Psalm 66:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 66:10)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Any metal is refined from its ore with heat, and the process of converting it to something useful varies according to the use to which it will be put. In the book The Fields of Home, Ralph Moody is taught by his grandpa that the metal must be heated to different colors (representing different degrees of heat) depending on what it is being shaped for. Every true child of God is given the trials the Lord is allowing our way because they are necessary to shape us and strengthen us for the use He would put us to, and for what lies ahead for each one of us.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+1%3A12" title="James 1:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 1:12)</span></a></span></p>

<p>There is an old saying, &#8220;Where there is smoke, there&#8217;s fire.&#8221; We could say with even greater certainty that &#8220;Where there is a trial, there&#8217;s a blessing!&#8221; It is possible for us to miss it, but if we turn to the Lord in our trials, we will certainly obtain a blessing, for whether it pertains to the big picture
(<span class="scripture">&#8220;when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life&#8221;</span>)
or the individual trial, the process is meant for our good, and is necessary for us to obtain many benefits and much preparation that we could not possibly obtain any easier way.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations: That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+1%3A6-7" title="I&nbsp;Peter 1:6-7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 1:6-7)</span></a></span></p>

<p>May the Lord help us to grasp the vision! There are precious things involved here, exceedingly precious! Yes, I have many times (and expect to many more times) experienced
<span class="scripture">&#8220;heaviness through manifold temptations&#8221;</span>;
and I have felt the heat, sometimes again and again and again in a similar manner, and other times a variety of different ways, but all of it is designed to test and improve my faith, that it
<span class="scripture">&#8220;might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.&#8221;</span>
Amen, Lord. Keep preparing me!</p>

<p class="signature">Wishing you the best of trials,<br />The Editor</p>

<h1>Man Rule</h1>

<p>When I first began to be burdened to write on the New Testament teaching about man rule in the church of God, I realized that the audience for such a writing would necessarily be a small one. For the teaching of the Word of God on this point can only be grasped by those who are wholly sanctified and sold out to Jesus without reserve. Only an individual completely ruled by the Holy Spirit can understand how a number of individuals can, as a body, be ruled by that same Spirit.</p>

<p>Although the comprehending audience may be small, the doctrine is vital. For it is the way of the Lord. He would teach us of His ways, for His ways are far above our ways, and His thoughts are far above our thoughts.</p>

<p>The church is the marriage of the human and the Divine. What is proper and appropriate for the members of the body, and what is the province of the Holy Spirit alone? Or, in other words, <b>what does the Lord mean</b>, when He tells us in His Word that,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;the kingdom <b>shall not be left to other people</b>,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Daniel+2%3A44" title="Daniel 2:44"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Daniel 2:44)</span></a></span>
and that
<span class="scripture">&#8220;government shall be on His shoulder&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+9%3A6" title="Isaiah 9:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 9:6)</span></a></span>?
Without an accurate vision of the proper relationship between the Holy Spirit and the people of God, we shall surely perish (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+29%3A18">Proverbs 29:18</a>).</p>

<p>It is the common belief of most of the nominal Christian world that God saves men out of the world, but it is the prerogative of men to shape and organize these converts into institutions for Christ. But this position is plainly shown to be false in the Word of God.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever. Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Daniel+2%3A44-45" title="Daniel 2:44-45"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Daniel 2:44-45)</span></a></span></p>

<p>We see plainly from this scripture that God, Himself, hath set up His church in the days of the kings of the Roman empire. Hear again the words of the Lord Jesus at that time,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter [a little stone], and upon this rock [the Christ in whom Peter believed&#8212;see previous verse] <b>I will build my church</b>; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+16%3A18" title="Matthew 16:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 16:18)</span></a></span>
Again,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and <b>the government shall be upon his shoulder</b>: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+9%3A6" title="Isaiah 9:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 9:6)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For the husband is the head of the wife, even as <b>Christ is the head of the church</b>.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A23" title="Ephesians 5:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 5:23)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Reader, you may rest assured that God has personally built His own church, that He governs it, that He is the active, living Head, and that He has not left His kingdom to other people. This solid foundation of understanding is absolutely necessary to approach the subject of exactly <i>how</i> God governs His church.</p>

<h2>Individual Government and Church Government</h2>
<p>The Bible plainly informs us, that
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his&#8230;. for as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A9%2C14" title="Romans 8:9,14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 8:9,14)</span></a></span>
A man who is led by the Spirit of God will not knowingly do something wrong, nor will a congregation that is led by the Spirit of God. A man who is not led by the Spirit of God will be led by <i>something</i>; this is equally true of a congregation. A man, led by the Holy Ghost, may make honest and unintentional mistakes by unwittingly following another impulse than that of God, but, by definition, if he is a man who is characterized by consistently following Divine leadership, then it can be fairly stated: here is a man who is led by the Spirit of God. That same Spirit will correct and reprove him, as needed, and again, the overall pattern of his life will be that of a Spirit-led man.</p>

<p>God, in dealing with us, does not take away our humanity and make us more than men or less than men. He simply makes us spiritual men&#8212;individuals who walk with God. Therefore, the work of God in the earth&#8212;His church overall and each member&#8217;s individual walk with God&#8212;can be a perfect blend of the Divine and the human if we allow the Lord to have His way.</p>

<p>Now this wonderful partnership is a very unequal relationship.
For God is far superior to us in every way. His thoughts are not our thoughts, nor His ways our ways (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+55%3A8-9">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).
How wonderful that God should seek us out, should desire for us to walk with Him. How careful He is in His dealings with us! How loving and kind, how merciful and longsuffering!
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+103%3A14" title="Psalm 103:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 103:14)</span></a></span>
He knocks, when He has full right to enter unannounced (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Rev.+3%3A20">Rev. 3:20</a>).
And this carefulness in dealing is fully reciprocated by all men who enter into this precious relationship to walk with God.
A great awe of God and His ways fills the soul (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ecclesiastes+5%3A1-2">Ecclesiastes 5:1-2</a>).
He knows what He is doing, while we do not. The surrendered soul is content to let Him have His way, to readily respond to His dealings, to carefully do as God would have it done. Such scriptures as,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A17" title="Ephesians 5:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 5:17)</span></a></span>
assume a majesty and authority to the spirit-filled man which is not apparent at all to one who is not filled with the Spirit of God.</p>

<p>Without this profound respect for God and His ways, we will get out of God&#8217;s order, <b>even if we love Him and want to please Him.</b> We must love Him enough&#8212;and be emptied of all self-reliance enough&#8212;that He can effectually work in us to will and do of His good pleasure. A great number of things are done in the name of the Lord that please Him not and are not according to His will.</p>

<p>In II Samuel, we read how that David determined to bring the ark of God out of Gibeah to Jerusalem. This was done out of love for God.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And they set the ark of God upon a new cart.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Samuel+6%3A3" title="II&nbsp;Samuel 6:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Samuel 6:3)</span></a></span>
They assembled before it with all reverence and honor, and played music before it. They were ignorant that the ark of God was not to be carried in that way. But when the oxen shook it, then
<span class="scripture">&#8220;<b>Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it.</b>&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Samuel+6%3A6" title="II&nbsp;Samuel 6:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Samuel 6:6)</span></a></span>
This is just exactly what we will do if we are not emptied of all self-reliance enough&#8212;we will take hold of God&#8217;s ark to help the Lord, and get into great trouble. It will start us down the path that leads to the substitution of human authority for Holy Spirit authority. It will begin the process that becomes characterized by us doing things <i>for</i> God rather than doing things <i>of</i> God.</p>

<p>The pressures of circumstances in our lives are very real, both at an individual level and at the congregational level. They will compel us to act, whether God has directed us or not, when things began to come apart, <b>unless the Lord has helped us to get a clear, definite vision of His way and helped us to die to self to the extent that we will not move without His approval.</b></p>

<p>We see this in the life of Saul, king of Israel.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.&#8221;</span>
It was all falling apart, so
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.&#8221;</span>
He did not feel good about this, but reasoned that the ends justified the means, hence his testimony,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.&#8221;</span>
And then the man of God, who feared the Lord and would not do things without His approval, told Saul,

<p>Avoiding the leadership of men, whether the one(s) leading is ourselves or someone else, is not merely a decent idea or a preferable option, and being ruled by the Holy Spirit is not merely a noble aspiration. The one is death, and the other is life; one is hell, the other, heaven. Oh,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A17" title="Ephesians 5:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 5:17)</span></a></span>!
</p>

<p>We have met people who downplayed the role of the Holy Spirit in personal guidance. I am convinced that many people doubt that the Holy Ghost actually leads and guides people in this way. One sister replied to a possible course of action, &#8220;Oh, however the spirit leads you!&#8221; This was said in a light, casual tone, with the implied thought that the &#8220;spirit&#8221;&#8212;i.e., your personal inclination&#8212;guides you in many ways. That is, if you felt strongly about something, then (according to her) that meant that the spirit was guiding you. It is impossible for folks in this condition to actually be led by the Spirit of God, or to work the works of God in His order and according to His will. The actual leadings of the Holy Spirit are not real enough to them and cannot be reverenced or awaited with God-given patience. They do not know what it is.</p>

<p>There are and have been many people who claim to be led by the Holy Spirit in their lives.
When their lives are tried (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+4%3A1">I&nbsp;John 4:1</a>),
the pattern of their guidance will reveal whether it is the Holy Spirit or something else. How necessary it is to wait on God!
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+4%3A5" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 4:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 4:5)</span></a></span>
The Holy Spirit will give us grace to wait until the Lord comes in a given matter, and He maketh manifest. Sometimes this is done by the fire of trial.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Every man&#8217;s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man&#8217;s work of what sort it is.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+3%3A13" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 3:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 3:13)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>This waiting on God, this making sure of the mind of the Lord, this refusal to move on our own, this reality of the Spirit&#8212;this is absolutely necessary to be governed and ruled by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>If we do not accept this as a true and necessary standard, then what do we make of such scriptures as,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+16%3A7" title="Acts 16:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 16:7)</span></a></span>
Do we then attempt to understand these brethren after the flesh, or do we accept and understand that all that has been said above was true and working in their case? They waited on God; they made sure of the mind of the Lord; they refused to move on their own; the Holy Ghost was very real to them; they were governed, controlled, and ruled by the Holy Spirit. To believe otherwise is to believe that the New Testament church is the work of men&#8217;s hands and to disbelieve the words of our Lord,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I will build my church.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+16%3A18" title="Matthew 16:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 16:18)</span></a></span>
He was and is still building it.</p>

<h2>The Authority of Men in God&#8217;s Church</h2>
<p>Let us consider now what it means to have limited authority as an officer in God&#8217;s church as delegated and backed by the true supreme Authority. All authority in an organization is derived from the head. Jesus is the Head in His church. The manifestations of authority in the subordinate positions beneath the head proceed from Him and are, in a sense, His authority extended through instrumentalities.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The Head, <b>from which</b> all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+2%3A19" title="Colossians 2:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 2:19)</span></a></span>
And, unlike the kingdoms and institutions of this world, the Head of the church, even our Lord and Savior, is able to abide within each and every member, working in them that which is well-pleasing, even the perfect will of God.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+4%3A6" title="Ephesians 4:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 4:6)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+12%3A11" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 12:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 12:11)</span></a></span>
This is plain. The Head works in each member; through the Spirit, He divides, or distributes, <i>as He will</i>. He is in you all, through us, and above all. Could language more accurately state the relationship between the governed and the Governor? Note, these descriptions came from men and women who were actually in this relationship with the Divine Head, actually filled, qualified, and used of the Spirit of God. The closer the record is studied, the more it is apparent: <b>it was not the rule of men; it was the rule of God over His own church, His body,</b> built by Him, subservient to Him, and actually controlled and directed by Him.</p>

<p>It is not that we claim the authority of the Head and presume to act in His name that carries weight here. It is His acknowledgment of us that is significant. It is the unmistakable evidence that God is present&#8212;that there is something involved far beyond the efforts of the people.</p>

<p>But we must look much closer at the unique structure of God&#8217;s church to fully appreciate what God hath wrought. <b>There is no hierarchy in the human elements,</b> i.e., none of the saved possesses authority over the other saved in such a way that part of the body is subservient to the other part all the time. Only the Divine Himself is dominant always. These statements are true because of the unique nature of regeneration in the heart of man by the Holy Spirit through the blood of Jesus.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Each and every saved soul is directly connected to God through Christ without any other intermediary. As a brother puts it,</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Salvation belongeth unto God, and Jesus Christ is His salvation. Bless His dear name!
No person can ignore the Son and be saved by the Father, nor despise the Father without rejecting the Son (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+10%3A6">Luke 10:6</a>). Let it be distinctly understood that God has so arranged the plan of redemption that no man or set of men can monopolize, control, or get a patent upon it. God has offered a free salvation to all the world, and it is impossible for the most crafty to convert it into a means of speculation. It is true there are moneyrun religions many, and hirelings many. But the
<span class="scripture">&#8220;hireling [is] not the shepherd&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+10%3A12" title="John 10:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 10:12)</span></a></span>;
not sent of God: and the moneymaking religions are frauds. Salvation is
<span class="scripture">&#8220;without money and without price&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+55%3A1" title="Isaiah 55:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 55:1)</span></a></span>;
therefore, whosoever would set a price upon it, proves he is not in possession of the article himself, and has but a counterfeit to offer. Every man on earth can come directly to the Author of salvation through Jesus Christ, and be saved independent of all men or angels.</p>

<p>How often have men presumed to take in or put out! But God does not recognize the efforts of men on this line. He reserves to Himself the right to insert or remove from His church.

Please note that nowhere does the Bible teach that <i>men</i> have the right or authority to bring in men into the church of the living God. We readily agree that men have the right and obligation to recognize what God has already done. Therefore we read such things as,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+2%3A9" title="Galatians 2:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 2:9)</span></a></span>
but we also read that this offering of the right hands of fellowship was because they
<span class="scripture">&#8220;perceived the grace that was given unto me.&#8221;</span>
The other saved people didn&#8217;t give Paul that grace&#8212;they just perceived that God had given it unto him and reacted to that fact. Peter didn&#8217;t put Simon the sorcerer out of the church when his heart condition was revealed, for Simon was never in God&#8217;s church, even though he had been baptized by God&#8217;s minister and professed that God had received him. Peter just recognized and perceived that Simon didn&#8217;t have God&#8217;s salvation, so Peter told him,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+8%3A21" title="Acts 8:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 8:21)</span></a></span>
He never got in, even though it looked as if he might have for a while to the eyes of men. But the Divine Governor was never fooled at any time, and in due time, He allowed some of His children to see what He had known all along.</p>

<p>One of the false doctrines that came out of the great falling away that resulted in the formation of the Roman Catholic Church was the doctrine of the authority of the keys. This great error resulted from man usurping the place of God, and twisting the scripture in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+16%3A19">Matthew 16:19</a>:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.&#8221;</span>
The misinterpretation of this text would put men in the driver&#8217;s seat instead of God. It would present matters as though God had obligated Himself to respond to men instead of the other way around.</p>

<p>What is the right meaning of the scripture? What does it mean to have the keys of the kingdom of heaven and to know that
<span class="scripture">&#8220;whatsoever thou shalt bind&#8221;</span>
or loose will be backed by heaven&#8217;s authority? The truth of the matter is closely related to our essential helplessness. As Jesus said,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;for without me, ye can do nothing.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+15%3A5" title="John 15:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 15:5)</span></a></span>
The context of the scripture in Matthew quoted above reads,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+16%3A17" title="Matthew 16:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 16:17)</span></a></span>
Men possess the keys to the kingdom of heaven when they are inspired by God Himself. Then, and only then, do they possess divine authority which God will honor. As Brother James puts it,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+5%3A14" title="I&nbsp;John 5:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 5:14)</span></a></span>
The outward result will appear to be that a person commands heaven, for they ask and God responds; but that is not the whole picture. God is the Author as well as the Finisher. His inspiration started the process.</p>

<p>To misunderstand the scripture in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+16%3A19">Matthew 16:19</a>
as conferring us with the power and authority to govern and control in the church of God is to launch ourselves on the path of presumption and man rule. It is to forget our place as servants&#8212;unprofitable servants at best. For the servant is not given authority to no longer be a servant, no matter how great his responsibilities; but remains a servant, even while wielding great authority in his Master&#8217;s name. When all is said and done, he is still just a servant. As one brother put it, &#8220;When the ministry expects to be served rather than to serve, then they have stepped over the line.&#8221;</p>

<p>In actuality, if a child of God gets exalted and begins to feel that they are something and can do great things, they will soon find that God doesn&#8217;t follow what they think He must do. He will leave them to themselves if they persist,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+5%3A5-6" title="I&nbsp;Peter 5:5-6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 5:5-6)</span></a></span>
This scripture completely covers the matter, for although a man is highly honoured and exalted (in a good sense) that God hears his prayer and answers from heaven, yet he remains a man. He is just as needy of divine help the next time as he was this time.</p>

<p>Another way of thinking of this wonderful relationship of God to us is that God is just too good to us to confer something on us that would make us independent of Him. In this way, He is a wonderful heavenly parent, originating an inspiration to look to Him for help and satisfying our cry for help. Yet the whole process leaves us still a child&#8212;an assisted, helped, thankful child, but still a child.</p>

<p>The true authority of the keys of the kingdom comes from the fact that God moves us to do what He knows is best. Therefore it is God that worketh in us. How marvelous that He would want to use such ungainly earthly vessels!
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+4%3A7" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 4:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 4:7)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>If we do not walk always in this lowliness of mind, then we will grieve the Lord at some point. We will either get ahead of the Spirit of God or behind. Perhaps we will give esteem and recognition to an undeserving brother when the Spirit of God would have us withdraw, or we will reject someone whom the Spirit of God is still using and blessing. How impossible it is to please the Lord without Him helping you to please Him!

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder.

The Bible teaches submission of all the members of Christ&#8217;s body to each other.</p>

<p>One of the prominent distinctions of the great apostasy of 270 A.D. was the exaltation of the ministry above the laity; then the exaltation of some of the ministry above the rest; and finally the evolvement of the man of sin himself. Such a condition would never have arisen if all had stayed subject, one to another, as Brother Peter taught and practiced.</p>

<p>But how can such a thing be? How can the learned be subject to the ignorant? How can the elder be subject to the younger? How can a man be subject to a woman? These are all pertinent questions, weighty and serious, and how thankful we are that the Bible answers them!</p>

<p>Every child of God possesses a pearl of great price&#8212;a personal experience of salvation, the wonderful and marvelous privilege of knowing God for himself.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+12%3A13" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 12:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 12:13)</span></a></span>
This brings about a marvelous equality which transcends nationality, social position, or gender.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+3%3A26-28" title="Galatians 3:26-28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 3:26-28)</span></a></span>
Since our sufficiency is of God (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+3%3A5">II&nbsp;Corinthians 3:5</a>),
and we are all equally needy and supplied according to our need, we have nothing of true worth to vaunt over each other. For that which is of great value (salvation),all the redeemed possess&#8212;it is
the common salvation (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jude+1%3A3">Jude 1:3</a>);
and whereas they differ greatly in education, social position, gender position, mental ability, physical capability, etc., these are deemed of little worth overall. Hear the words of Brother Paul:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+3%3A7-8" title="Philippians 3:7-8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 3:7-8)</span></a></span>
Dung has some value, of course, but how lowly and small in the scheme of things. What an adjustment salvation brings into the value system of the holder! God&#8217;s salvation in the heart is esteemed above all, and the things of earth began to be sized up accurately. How limited they are! How much of this time and place!</p>

<p>Such is the great leveling effect of the gospel.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+1%3A9-10" title="James 1:9-10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 1:9-10)</span></a></span>
Some folks are too low. Their position in life has stunted them and their values are of the gutter. They need to come up.
Others are high-minded (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+6%3A17-19">I&nbsp;Timothy 6:17-19</a>),
and need to come down. They are proud and puffed up, and God wants to take that pride out of them. He wants to cause both kinds to rejoice. Yea,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+40%3A4" title="Isaiah 40:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 40:4)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>The subjection of all of the children of God to each other is possible because salvation is the pre-eminent thing in each of their lives. That is, they esteem a clean heart and a clean life above every other human trait. Well, you may ask, are some not more saved than others? The answer is no&#8212;you are either saved or you are not. You are either dead or alive. Well, you may persist, are not the more experienced, more careful, etc., deserving of more honor? The reply to this lies in the nature of salvation as an undeserved gift. If you recall, it was previously stated in this article that God inspires a thing within us as well as completes it, thus making Him the Author and the Finisher. This is as true of salvation and all the depths of salvation as well. No man can come to God except the Father draw him. No man can change his own heart. No man can live and grow in grace except the Lord both inspire him to Christian fruit and bestow upon him increase.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Without me, you can do nothing.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+15%3A5" title="John 15:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 15:5)</span></a></span>

All children of God are saved and keep saved through unmerited favor&#8212;the grace of God.</p>

<p>Now it is perfectly true that some of the saved are in better spiritual health. Some are smarter than the others; some are more learned; some are more energetic; some are more gifted at dealing with others; others are gifted in differing ways. Some are more wealthy; some are better disciplined; some have more training and teaching and better family backgrounds and moral conditioning, etc. If these, or anything else, is valued more or even equally with an experience of salvation, then this humble subjection to one another becomes warped and twisted or lost.</p>

<p>As an example, let us consider a congregation of believers who have found the Lord one by one. There are elderly brothers and sisters there, who have been serving the Lord for a long time since He changed them. There are others who have been saved awhile. Still others have only been saved a short time. And there are young children who have really gotten saved. If all are indeed humble and <b>esteem the possession of salvation as meaning more than anything else,</b> then all their attitudes and thoughts toward each other will revolve around their perception that the others are born from above by the power of God. This attitude is usually expressed by a great joy and thankfulness that one is saved. That you are delivered from the power of sin by the power of God. It is not a maturity of perception and comprehension; it is a rejoicing in the reality of regeneration as a personal possession, first personally, and then a rejoicing in the reality of the salvation of each person who seems to really have a like experience.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;To <b>them that have obtained like precious faith with us</b> through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+1%3A1" title="II&nbsp;Peter 1:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 1:1)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>And so each child of God has a direct connection to the Lord Himself and becomes conscious that there are others who also have this direct connection to the Lord. Upon this foundation, there is a definite consciousness that every saved person has God within him/her, and God can manifest Himself through His earthen vessel in any way that He cares to do so. That is always a possibility. God may speak through a child at a certain point. He may speak through a stammering tongue. As a matter of experience, God usually works through those whom He has called to certain places in His body of believers (and this is in complete accordance with the principle here expressed), <b>but God can and does work outside of the accustomed pattern as He sees fit.</b> Among those who are usually so used and increasingly among those who are just learning the ways of the Lord, there is a consciousness that God can and may work in this way. All this leads to a great deal of waiting on the Lord. <b>A minimal valuation of human gifts and an esteemed valuation of Divine inspiration and blessing.</b> It leads to meetings where the predominant feature is a listening for and a deep appreciation of God working in human lives.</p>

<p>Getting the focus on God and keeping it there is one of the priorities of the Holy Spirit. He strives mightily with us to bring us to lowliness of mind, living faith in God, and a deep appreciation of what it means to dwell with brethren who can characterized as having
<span class="scripture">&#8220;one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+4%3A6" title="Ephesians 4:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 4:6)</span></a></span>
It is natural and human to look at the things which are seen, and to evaluate and react to one another in this way, but the Spirit of God will teach us to
<span class="scripture">&#8220;look&#8230;&#8203;at the things which are not seen.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+4%3A18" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 4:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 4:18)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>This whole picture agrees with the vision presented in Revelation:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And He had <b>in his right hand</b> seven stars&#8230;. The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest <b>in my right hand</b>, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels [messengers] of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+1%3A16%2C20" title="Revelation 1:16,20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 1:16,20)</span></a></span>
<b>God&#8217;s messengers to His congregations are in His right hand&#8212;thus signifying His control of them and their submission and compliance to Him.</b> Jesus is in charge and is on the job, so to speak. Yea,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+18%3A20" title="Matthew 18:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 18:20)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Christ has only built one church which consists of only born again people. There is not a single hypocrite in the group that He personally governs and acknowledges.
He puts folks in as He saves them, and He blots their names out when they fall away (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+2%3A47%3B+Exodus+32%3A33">Acts 2:47; Exodus 32:33</a>).
</p>

<p>The efforts of men to organize churches <i>for</i> Jesus have succeeded in dividing the saved from each other in different groups and in mixing them in artificial fellowship with unsaved people. The entire philosophy behind the formal institutions of men is the concept of an absent Christ. This is a false and unbiblical position. Men have usurped the part of the heavenly Governor and have constructed their own churches, but their perfidy will be revealed. The Lord Jesus will not acknowledge their structures as His own. Others are deceived into believing that the Holy Spirit is directing and guiding them when He is not.</p>

<h2>Walking in the Light of Regeneration</h2>
<p>When a man, woman, or child comes to God under the drawing of His Spirit, heart-broken with Godly sorrow, repenting of all sin, and inspired to believe in Jesus for salvation, our loving Lord works a great, revolutionary change in the heart.
Old things pass away and all things become new (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+5%3A17">II&nbsp;Corinthians 5:17</a>).
A great love for God and His ways is implanted in the soul, and the person is filled with a new motivation. A great desire to please the Lord fills the heart. A hunger for the Word of God. All of this is as it should be. God has designed it so that the light that fills the soul at the beginning will increase steadily
<span class="scripture">&#8220;unto the perfect day,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+4%3A18" title="Proverbs 4:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 4:18)</span></a></span>
when our faith shall be lost in sight as we experience for ourselves the perfect wonders of the glory world.</p>

<p>But this increasing victory and triumph in our lives is predicated on one solemn condition, i.e.,
that we <i>walk</i> in the light that Jesus shines on our pathway (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1%3A7">I&nbsp;John 1:7</a>).
We must mind the same rule that God gives us, from the time that we understand it and always thereafter (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+3%3A16">Philippians 3:16</a>).
To do otherwise is to forfeit our blessing and peace.</p>

<p>One of these principles of truth which instinctively arises from the regenerated experience is a clear and definite knowledge that God does not save us from sin to divide us from each other in different groups. He saves us to put us together with all the other redeemed. He intends for us to be with Him, and He with us, now and forever and forever. Therefore, <b>a child of God must not ever fellowship with a group or enter into a relationship with others that would divide him from all other saved people.</b> This is not an easy rule to follow, for everywhere we find some of God&#8217;s children caught in this or that, and it would seem that if you join one organization, then you are separated from those in others, and if you stay out of them all, you are still separated from those of God&#8217;s children who are within them. We would like to quote here from an account, based on a true story, of how two of God&#8217;s children had to contend with this dilemma.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Joe could not be persuaded to unite with them, for he said he could not unite with one body, and therefore raise a barrier to exclude another in whom he had confidence and knew was a child of God as much as he. As this faith believed and practiced close communion, Joe declined to give them his membership.</p>

<p>Alfred was very much surprised when Joe refused to unite with this body of people, and inquired of him his reason for not doing so. &#8220;I did not unite with them because I could not break the last tie between us,&#8221; replied Joe. &#8220;You know that I have confidence in you. I am sure that you are as much a child of God as I am, and I could not come around the Lord&#8217;s table and see you kept out. No, indeed; if there is ever a barrier raised between any other child of God and me, it will be one he raises.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what do you mean to do?&#8221; inquired Alfred. &#8220;You cannot go around all alone, can you? I should like to see you get settled somewhere where you can get in the harness just right and feel satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ask me what I mean to do,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;Well, I shall tell you. I mean to live by
<span class="scripture">&#8216;every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+4%3A4" title="Matthew 4:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 4:4)</span></a></span>
and be guided by it. As to working, I do not see how I could work more with any body of people than I am doing now. I am waiting on the Lord, and what he tells me to do that will I do. Do you not think that I am on the safe track? And do you not think that I shall be satisfied when I do just what he tells me to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure that you will,&#8221; replied Alfred; &#8220;and as to a barrier between us, I am sure that I shall never raise one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have already raised it,&#8221; replied Joe quickly, &#8220;for I cannot speak with you in the organization to which you belong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that need not be a barrier between us,&#8221; hastily replied Alfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not,&#8221; said Joe, &#8220;but somehow it seems to me there is not the freedom there that has been formerly. I feel that these organizations are dividing God&#8217;s children. You know we had wonderful times and God met with us at the little community house when we were all together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be true,&#8221; replied Alfred, &#8220;but there are some things we shall never understand,&#8221; and he turned and walked slowly to the house. Joe had aroused something within his soul.</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[Williams, Effie M.; <a href="../../../texts/The_Man_of_His_Counsel/index.html"><i>The Man of His Counsel</i></a>, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/The_Man_of_His_Counsel/Joe_Finds_Himself/index.html">Joe Finds Himself</a>&#8221;]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>This is a fair picture of one of the perplexities faced by many of God&#8217;s little children. The answer to the religious confusion that is all around us is to take a stand on the Word of God. It is to believe and trust that,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;according as <b>his divine power</b> hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+1%3A3" title="II&nbsp;Peter 1:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 1:3)</span></a></span>
It is to avoid leaning to our own understanding. It is a complete dependence on God.</p>

<h2>How Can We Know That the Holy Spirit Is Leading?</h2>
<p>If it were not for the opposition of the enemy of our souls, the working of the Lord would be much easier to see. There is nothing like the work of the Holy Spirit, and the devil cannot imitate him perfectly in every respect. There is a basic difference in motivation, as well, for the Lord comes to do us good, to deliver, and to give us victory and help us to please Him, while the enemy comes to discourage, to destroy, to ruin, and to get us to hell. Even when he comes as an angel of light or quotes the Word of God, it is to steal and to kill, but the paths of the Lord are peaceful and happy ones, and He is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</p>

<p>Almost every genuine manifestation of the Spirit of Truth has its well-crafted counterfeit, but there are two things which the devil cannot imitate. He cannot deliver people from sin and give them real victory, for then would his house, being divided against itself, fall; and, in the end, he cannot completely hide the hideous fruit that sin produces. He can put up a fairly convincing show to the eyes of men for quite a while, but in the end, the tree will bear fruit corresponding to the kind of life within it.</p>

<p>For instance, we might say that the Spirit of God will teach a reverence and high respect for all past dealings of the Lord, in the Word of God and in the known history of God&#8217;s little children. So we might conclude that such an element working in a given people or person shows definite evidence that the Spirit of God is guiding and leading. And the Spirit of God does work in this way, but the spirit of formality also puts up an imitation of this characteristic. But in a people under the Lord&#8217;s control, that respect and appreciation is used in a vital, appropriate way, while the enemy&#8217;s workings produce a deadening effect.</p>

<p>This situation is illustrated in the New Testament in the attempts of God&#8217;s children to find the will of God concerning circumcision, the Mosaic law, and the proper instruction of the Gentiles. And in the end, after much trial and refining, a clear and definite standard from God was perceived and grasped by those who were lead by the Holy Spirit, <b>but not by those who were led by something else.</b> Now notice, it was highly confusing to the mind to try to figure out that circumcision was no longer applicable. A long line of teaching, from God, with attendant blessings was involved. But in time, it began to be plain to Spirit-led individuals that the Lord was not blessing circumcision in the flesh as He had in another dispensation. Understanding was given by the Spirit of God, as He manifested Himself in working through His chosen vessels, and it brought the blessing of God to all that received it. To those who did not, they missed that blessing. When all the dust settled, so to speak, the perfect will of God was manifest to all who were led by that selfsame Spirit. The standard that the Governor held was plain:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+6%3A15-16" title="Galatians 6:15-16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 6:15-16)</span></a></span>
We note that the work of God cannot be reduced to formula or policy without leaving the following of the Spirit of God. Furthermore, the end result of the lives that followed the light of God was an increased blessing, while the end result in the lives of the circumcision was as you may read in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+1%3A10">Titus 1:10</a>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Therefore thus saith the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: <b>he that believeth shall not make haste.</b>&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+28%3A16" title="Isaiah 28:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 28:16)</span></a></span>
Amen.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ecclesiastes+5%3A2" title="Ecclesiastes 5:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ecclesiastes 5:2)</span></a></span>
Being led by the Lord means much waiting on the Lord. Being governed by the Lord means much waiting on the Lord. Walking with God means much waiting on God. The promise is to those who wait upon the Lord.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> is a God of judgment: <b>blessed are all they that wait for him.</b>&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+30%3A18" title="Isaiah 30:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 30:18)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But <b>they that wait upon the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> shall renew their strength</b>; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+40%3A31" title="Isaiah 40:31"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 40:31)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>But this waiting must be <b>waiting with earnest expectation toward God.</b> It is not the spirit of fatalism or cynicism. It is active, living faith in God that He will take care of all things. And this includes setting us to doing what we should be doing, and restraining us from doing what we should not be doing. That is, God has something for each of us to do, and we need to discover where we should labor in His order and be working there.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A17" title="Ephesians 5:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 5:17)</span></a></span>
Salvation finds us where we are in life, and trueness to God mandates that we should withdraw from things that are wrong.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?&#8230;&#8203;<b>Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate,</b> saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+6%3A14%2C17-18" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 6:14,17-18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 6:14,17-18)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Some of us are inclined by nature to be shy and indecisive; others are inclined to be bold and rash. But God knows what is best and what vessel or vessels He sees fit to use. How blessed to wait upon Him&#8212;to let Him have His way!
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, <b>until he please</b>.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Song+8%3A4" title="Song 8:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Song 8:4)</span></a></span>
He is the Master of His house; let Him have His way in all. We know that He cares whether we perish, and He will come in good time to His trusting children.</p>

<p>Well, yes, says someone, but what if someone gets out of order? What then?</p>

<p>If we cannot trust God when things go wrong, when can we trust Him? A minister became incensed over the spiritual condition of another minister. He called together a meeting to <i>do something</i> about it. He was nervous and upset. He pleaded with the ministers to <i>do something</i>. He did not realize that they <i>were</i> doing something. They were trusting God, both with the minister in question and the one doing the questioning. Finally, the upset one wound down, and it was very quiet. The others were waiting for the Lord to manifest His will. Finally a brother spoke up. &#8220;No one ever got too big for the Lord to spank,&#8221; he said. That was it&#8212;the mind of the Lord. It satisfied about everyone there, with a few exceptions. We all started to leave. The minister who had called the meeting jumped up. &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to <i>do</i> anything?!&#8221; he said. He was nearly beside himself and in no condition to realize that God had just let everybody know to leave this in His hands. So the brother went into this meeting without a blessing and came out of it without a blessing. In due time, the Lord took care of the matter.</p>

<p>A congregation gathered one night without a minister present&#8212;that is, one of the Lord&#8217;s ministers. No one realized that a minister did not happen to be there that night. The Lord blessed their singing and it came time for preaching. A false prophet got up. He preached a false message to the congregation of God&#8217;s little children. They endured it. Finally he sat down. There was a moment of silence, then someone called a song. It was a song which contradicted the false message which had been spoken. The Lord anointed the song, and souls began to be convicted of their need. A number sought the Lord for salvation. The false preacher left in disgust; God&#8217;s little children had the victory.</p>

<p>How capable the Lord is of taking care of His work, His people! How wonderful to serve a wonderful God! He can turn that which seems to harm me into everlasting joy.</p>

<p>Instead of different classes of God&#8217;s people, the governed and the governing, all of us are brethren. If someone gets to feeling that he or she is above others, we simply trust God to take care of the matter. Only in this way can <i>all</i> the members of the body submit to each other&#8212;because of the workings of God in each other.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+5%3A5" title="I&nbsp;Peter 5:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 5:5)</span></a></span>

<h1>Close Counterfeits and Not-So-Close Counterfeits</h1>

<p>After the great apostasy of the New Testament church (which was pretty much all-pervasive by about 270 A.D.), hundreds of years of human history elapsed before truth began to emerge from the great errors and myths of the Roman Catholic Church. This false religion, the church of the man of sin (the Anti-Christ), epitomized a level of religious corruption and error that has yet to be surpassed, at least in longevity and magnitude, right up to our day. The history of this false body is a revelation of what sin can do in an institutional setting.</p>

<p>A restoration of truth began in the Protestant reformation. Little by little, in successive steps of courage and trueness, the foundational truths of the New Testament were rediscovered and embraced. Martin Luther: justification by faith in God, instead of works. John Wesley: perfected salvation through sanctification of the Spirit of God. If each of these reformers had been true to God completely and walked without ceasing in the light that God shone on their pathway, there would have been an entire restoration of truth at that time, but such was not the case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">It could not have been expected that all the Scriptural truths and principles should at any time or by any one reformer be recovered from the rubbish under which they had been buried for a thousand years. There have been numerous reforms, bringing out various truths that had been obscured by the apostasy. Thus <b>Truth in her progress upward to the Scriptural level, has arisen only by successive steps,</b> God having to use human instrumentalities that were limited by the prevailing tendencies and beliefs of the times. Each reformer naturally dealt with conditions that were most conspicuous from his view-point and was exercised in questions of truth that applied only to such conditions. His reform work was not final in character, inasmuch as it left some errors still uncorrected. Hence the progress upward was by a succession of reforms, each, as a general thing, springing from a higher level of truth and spiritual attainment than those preceding.</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[Byers, Andrew L.; <a href="../../../texts/Birth_of_a_Reformation/index.html"><i>Birth of a Reformation</i></a>, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Birth_of_a_Reformation/Introduction/index.html">Introduction</a>&#8221;]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>This process of rediscovery was final in its character during the holiness reformation of the late 1800&#8217;s. The possession of the experience of perfect love, taught so strongly and commonly in the New Testament, raised a serious and significant question to the children of God of that time. That question was, <b>&#8220;Why, even though we loved God with all our heart, soul, and strength, and we feel a wonderful oneness with all others who are truly saved and have the same like experience-then why are we separated in different organizations and groups?&#8221;</b> (As you can see, this question is just as pertinent and significant to each child of God today as it was then.)</p>

<p>The scriptural answer to that question is that God has created His body without schisms.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked: That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+12%3A24-25" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 12:24-25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 12:24-25)</span></a></span>
Note that this scripture informs that
<span class="scripture">&#8220;<b>God hath tempered the body together&#8230;&#8203;that there should be no schism in the body.</b>&#8221;</span>
The disparities of men are many, and their inability to get along is legendary and practically a given, but God has a way of taking care of this when He saves people. He puts something in there, that if allowed to grow, to find all God has provided, and to come to Christian maturity; then this great salvation in the heart of each possessor will keep all in subjection to the Head and humble and lowly in mind toward each other. This heavenly experience will enable people of widely differing comprehension, temperaments, and divergent ways to dwell together in harmony and unity under the Divine government.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>This wonderful truth was rediscovered and contended for in the reformation of the 1880&#8217;s by enlightened souls all over the world. There was tremendous opposition from the organized churches of their day, for the practical application of the above truth meant that people should come out&#8212;actually leave&#8212;the churches which men had organized, and be complete in Christ, trusting Him to govern and keep them <b>as a body of people</b>. It was nothing less than an attempt to stand on the same ground as the New Testament church, <b>and it worked</b>. That is, God honored and made a way for those who endeavored to walk in the light. The stirring resulted from facing the evils of the day, among which were the sins of division fostered and nourished by loyalty to &#8220;my church.&#8221;</p>

<p>The movement of these enlightened people went on for a number of years, from about 1880 to approximately 1910-1915, when their leadership began to go back on what they had taught until finally that group of people could fairly be characterized as simply another worldly church with a unique doctrinal angle on the church question. All along, as the apostasy of these people preceded further and further, different ones would be true to God and the light that He had given them, and they would escape.</p>

<p>In due time, many of these found each other and attempted to hold the same truth that had been discovered in the previous century. They were generally called &#8220;anti-necktie&#8221; because a common characteristic among them was an abhorrence of that article of clothing as being ornamental and superfluous. (The saints before the apostasy had held that same conviction.)</p>

<p>As time passed, another group of people left the original group on the basis of a different interpretation of the book of Revelations. They became known as &#8220;seventh-seal&#8221; people.</p>

<p>Each of these groups split and splintered until today there is a multitude of different groups all claiming to be right, and each possessing some degree of light and some degree of error. In this, of course, they have simply followed the course of all sectism in Christianity (and even non-Christianity), for it is the nature of man to divide, then divide, then divide again, etc. As
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+5%3A20">Galatians 5:20</a>
informs us, <i>variance</i> is a work of the flesh.</p>

<p>To a great extent, whether knowingly or unknowingly, there has been a great betrayal of the truths taught in the Bible on this subject; and it is this great succession of betrayals which has brought about the close counterfeits and not-so-close counterfeits which we have on hand today. If you love the Lord with all your heart, and you are deeply interested in serving Him without entanglement with idolatry, then what we have to say will be of some interest to you.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>The dictionary defines <i>counterfeit</i> as, &#8220;An inferior substitute imitating an original.&#8221; There are degrees of inferiority. Some are so obvious that almost anyone could readily identify them, while others are so sophisticated that the difference between them and the genuine is extremely difficult to detect. One could spend one&#8217;s entire lifetime going from one thing to another without examining even half of the subtle counterfeits on the religious market, so to speak. Even as we write these words, we are conscious that many of God&#8217;s little children labor under handicap in these places, for the intent of our adversary is to hinder and thwart the spiritual life in every way possible.</p>

<p>Now very few of these groups of people really understand what they are doing and are willfully set on being fraudulent. You will find plenty of sincerity mixed with the insincere among people who are not clear in holiness. Almost all of them possess some light, just as a counterfeit dollar bill has a great deal about it that is genuine in appearance. It is plain to be seen, that if you are trying to ascertain the authentic on the basis on the presence of sincerity or the existence of merit, then you will find that nearly everything out there has something to commend it.</p>

<p>There is a severe temptation to settle for the best you see, rather than God&#8217;s best. The entire process tries the child of God to the uttermost. If you are unwilling to compromise your values that the Lord taught you, then Giant Despair will attempt to crush all hope, and whisper that it is no use&#8212;nobody lives just like the Bible teaches, and nowhere is the truth held and taught in its fulness. Surely God has a tried and tested people! No one has ever yet drifted into the truth, but
<span class="scripture">&#8220;the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+11%3A12" title="Matthew 11:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 11:12)</span></a></span>

God&#8217;s way is a <i>pressing</i> way, and the seeker for what He has to give must <i>violently</i> tear himself away from everything else. We quote a little from <i>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Then the Interpreter took him, and led him up towards the door of the palace; and behold, at the door stood a great company of men, <b>as desirous to go in; but durst not.</b> There also sat a man at a little distance from the door, at a tableside, with a book and his inkhorn before him, to take the name of him that should enter therein; he saw also, that in the doorway stood many men in armour to keep it, being resolved to do the men that would enter what hurt and mischief they could. Now was Christian somewhat in amaze.</p>

<p>At last, when every man started back for fear of the armed men, Christian saw a man of a very stout countenance come up to the man that sat there to write, saying, <b>&#8220;Set down my name, Sir&#8221;</b>: the which when he had done, he saw the man draw his sword, and put a helmet upon his head, and rush toward the door upon the armed men, who laid upon him with deadly force; but the man, not at all discouraged, fell to cutting and hacking most fiercely. So after he had received and given many wounds to those that attempted to keep him out,
he cut his way through them all [<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+14%3A22">Acts 14:22</a>],
and pressed forward into the palace, at which there was a pleasant voice heard from those that were within, even of those that walked upon the top of the palace, saying&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in, come in; Eternal glory thou shalt win.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he went in, and was clothed with such garments as they.</p>

<p>Then Christian smiled and said, &#8220;I think verily I know the meaning of this.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>We want to say for the encouragement of all those who want all that God has to give, that
<b>God does indeed have a church</b> (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A25-27">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>),
<b>and it is worth what it costs to perceive it and take a stand for it.</b> It is worth wading through the counterfeits to find the true.</p>

<p>Still, it takes more than just fervency and unswerving pursuit. We have seen a movement of people, purporting to be the true, the original church of the New Testament, which has gradually been revealed as a mass of fanaticism and bondage over a period of about twelve years. They furiously contend with another body of people who have been steadily compromising over that same period of time. We confess to you, dear reader, that we barely avoided believing in that first group when they were starting out. Their meetings seemed so spiritual and stirring, though we were troubled by a great deal of emotionalism, which the Spirit of God had taught us was not adequate and dependable to sustain one in spiritual conflicts. There were some other troubling things, too, in the lives of some who were in the forefront of the thing, but it really seemed as if these were things that would be corrected in time. The Spirit of God seemed to be blessing them. We were earnestly praying about the matter. A certain point was brought up upon which the Spirit of God had instructed us. The line which the Lord had drawn for us between right and wrong on that point was rejected by a congregation of these folks. We were willing to change, yet we knew that the Lord had taught us what we were holding on the subject. We felt that perhaps they were more spiritual than us, and were willing to comply, only with this provision: that we needed the approval of the Lord on us changing. Whereupon they replied that they did not believe in these individual leadings. They believed, instead, in all of God&#8217;s children walking in lockstep to collective light, and thus, they contended, was the only way that unity (actually, uniformity) could be.</p>

<p>We had never met something just like this and prayed earnestly for guidance. We began to perceive that it ran contrary to how God had been teaching us over the years, and then the Lord greatly helped us. In a wonderful way, we found two articles written back in the 1930&#8217;s which plainly and clearly dealt with the issue of individual leadings. What a blessing they were to us! There was a third article as well, and we were able to obtain a copy. We told this close counterfeit group of the truth what we had found, and they rejected it. Over the next twelve years, reports began to filter back of <b>the end result of getting off on that point.</b> It was horrible. It was amazing. Even writing this now, I shake my head in amazement at how far such a thing can remove one from the truth. It was only the mercy of God that kept us out.</p>

<p>It is extremely difficult to pin down the spirit of error in all its manifestations. It is extremely slippery and elusive. It seems so right and commendable to those under its influence. Scriptures can be quoted that cover the matter, and those scriptures should end the matter; but they do not. There is a power that absorbs and swallows the strokes of truth, yet the end of the matter is not holiness and drawing close to God, after all. It is
<b>a way that seems right,</b> oh, so right, to man, but <b>the end is the way of death</b> (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+16%3A25">Proverbs 16:25</a>).
</p>

<p>The Lord allowed this temptation to us because this is standard fare for His children. God sees to it that we love Him with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength by allowing our love for Him to be purified and refined in these ways, among others. After this kind of experience, you can say with certainty, &#8220;I <i>know</i> I love Thee better, Lord, than any earthly joy.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/The_Half_Has_Never_Yet_Been_Told/index.html" title="The Half Has Never Yet Been Told">*</a></p>

<p>The group which the above-mentioned folks left condemned them just as severely as they were, in turn, condemned. We could not stay with them, either. There were other things about them that troubled us. A philosophy of liberality, and &#8220;love, love; cover eyes,&#8221; was taking root widely among the ministry; and in 1984, they grieved the Lord by allowing and giving place among them to ministers who were teaching things contrary to the Bible&#8212;things that they knew were wrong. When one of the older ministers was questioned about this, they replied, &#8220;We are so afraid.&#8221; What they were afraid of was that standing true to God would cause a split in the group, and so <b>they were willing to offend God and betray the truth to nurture and keep a group of people together.</b> Well, it kept them together at the expense of releasing a general let-down and worldliness among them. They denied this, of course. Eventually, a number of them went so far that the others could not stomach it, and there is where they drew a line between what was acceptable and what was not acceptable. Trouble was, it was not God doing the drawing&#8212;it was them. They are being left more and more to their own devices.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Now, God helping us, we want to go a little further into understanding these matters, and explore the factors that lead to a group of people getting out from under the control of God and evolving into something else than God&#8217;s people.</p>

<p>One of the common characteristics is the little-by-little aspect. This is extremely subtle. If the devil presented some thing that seemed significant, people would shrink from that. He is too cunning to approach this matter in that way&#8212;he suggests little &#8220;no harm&#8221; things. Each of these, taken by itself, would not seem to constitute something worth resisting. Each of these things blurs the line between blessing and non-blessing, until a lack of clarity, a kind of fogginess, obscures the end of these things. People do not realize the consequences of what they are doing. They do not discern the elements at work in the matter. They assume that all is well. &#8220;How can we be deceived after knowing so much of the truth?&#8221; They trust their leaders, and these leaders are under the same influence. Probing, digging, questioning, and making sure began to take on the shades of disloyalty. The scripture in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+17%3A11">Acts 17:11</a>
is forgotten.
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A15">II&nbsp;Timothy 2:15</a>
is forgotten as well, at least as pertains to
<span class="scripture">&#8220;show thyself <i>approved</i> unto God.&#8221;</span>
The scriptures are searched only to prove the values and mores of the general group, or to change them; instead of a great openness to discover what the Bible really is saying to us. The stage is set for the rise of a rival love to God: the love of a group of people&#8212;which is simply a modified form of love of self <i>in group form</i>. The love of &#8220;my church&#8221; masquerades as an <i>identical</i> thing to love of God and truth.</p>

<p>At the bottom of it all is a horrible presumption (which does not appear that way in the least to those who are presuming)&#8212;at least as it pertains to the government and institutional relationship of those who worship together. The unspoken, unrealized, and unacknowledged belief is that &#8220;we&#8221; know enough now to function &#8220;for&#8221; God in a certain capacity, and this is where the faith of the leaders and supporters is placed. A certain selfconfidence, <i>as a group</i>, goes with this. This horrible thing arises from below, from the fleshly pride and confidence of man, not from above; and it frequently expresses itself in sentiments such as these: &#8220;One minister may be mistaken, but <i>all</i> the ministers can&#8217;t be wrong.&#8221; Only, they can. God can and does let a group of ministers pursue a way that is not of Him to prove what is in their hearts collectively, just as He will allow one of His children to get into error for the same reason. He is faithful to warn and deal with (1) an individual heart, or (2), many individual hearts acting collectively; but if another voice is entertained and the checks of the Spirit of God are disregarded, then the Lord will let us go. This group pride (self-confidence) varies in intensity in inverse proportion to the amount of true spirituality in individual hearts. The deeper we go in God, the less confident we feel in ourselves, and the more we look to God to help us in our need.</p>

<p>I marvel at the crucialness of this point, and I also marvel at how easy it is to pass by it lightly with hardly a realization of its importance. <b>Many an humble brother or sister, who would not ever deign to take this &#8220;We Know&#8221; attitude personally, and would conclude that for them individually or anyone else individually to do so would be bigotry and arrogance, will feel comfortable with this attitude as a group.</b> &#8220;All the ministers together cannot be wrong.&#8221; The underlying belief in this creed is that while an individual or several individuals might miss the voice of God and be mistaken, all of the saved together can&#8217;t possibly be. <b>Only, they can.</b> Oh, please take heed! We are compelled to state the solemn truth yet again. Consider: if I am zero without the guiding hand of the Holy Ghost, and you are zero without the same Divine hand, and everyone who is saved is zero without God&#8217;s merciful guidance; then what do all of us add up to? Behold, no matter how many zeros are joined together with confidence in each other, we are zero together and will stay zero collectively and individually. How true the words, individually and collectively,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Without me, you can do nothing.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+15%3A5" title="John 15:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 15:5)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Most groups, who have had some exposure to the scriptural teaching that Jesus built His church and has never relinquished control of the same (i.e., the kingdom has not been left to other men), <b>focus on the trappings and forms</b> of a people given to Divine trust. With these people, here is the emphasis. Much is made of <b>a lack of planned program for meetings</b>. It is regarded as highly virtuous to <b>abhor a written creed</b>. Highly influential and authoritative positions within a given group of people are downplayed in an effort to <b>pay lip service to the thought that we are a people ruled directly by the hand of God.</b> All of these things at the collective level have their parallel in individual lives. People claim to be led by God, to wholly trust God, and to be consecrated in every respect to follow wherever He leads; yet in times of crisis, who is really followed is made manifest. Most people who claim to be led by the Lord simply aren&#8217;t, including many good and wellmeaning people. If anything, this is even more true of religious groups, as compared to religious individuals.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>If it is rare to find individuals sold out to God&#8212;actually guided by Him, who move &#8220;at the impulse of His love&#8221;&#8212;it is even more rare to find a <i>group</i> of people who are led collectively by that same Holy Spirit. <b>Most perceptive people do not believe that God really leads people on a day by day basis.</b> They perceive that a great deal of what is touted as Holy Spirit leading is something else entirely&#8212;usually enthusiasm, zeal, even superstition, or just wishful thinking. Some of these will restrain themselves from saying anything, not wishing to discourage anyone; yet the fact remains that a proven reality of Holy Spirit leading is not often observed, to the extent that a number of people do not believe that there is such a thing. A certain family of our acquaintance had the habit of saying, &#8220;as the Spirit moves you,&#8221; in response to anything that a person felt very strongly about, and this remark expressed the common skepticism prevalent on the subject.</p>

<p>Now, no one is led by the Lord so completely that they function outside their humanity, nor is it necessary or even desirable to do so. I do not normally need to ask the Lord whether He is leading me to eat a meal or go to the mailbox anymore than I need to ask the Lord whether He is leading me to take my next breath. And yet, there may be an occasion where it is imperative and vital to request Divine guidance about the ordinary affairs of life. And so we find the first principle of a life of absolute trust in God: <b>we are out of our depth overall.</b> The Bible plainly teaches us that
<span class="scripture">&#8220;the steps of a good man are ordered of the Lord,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+37%3A23" title="Psalm 37:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 37:23)</span></a></span>
and
<span class="scripture">&#8220;it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+10%3A23" title="Jeremiah 10:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jeremiah 10:23)</span></a></span>
God has so made us that we can function without puppetlike assistance; yet we are not equipped overall for success or true peace and contentment without Divine assistance. How much we need the Lord!</p>

<p>Here we are in this strange mixture of <b>a certain self-capability with a definite deficiency of capability</b>. How it should move us to humility! As individuals or collectively, we are as little children who know not how to come in or go out. We do not even know when we should cease to try and simply wait or when we should forge ahead and bravely trust. We need to be taught, and how thankful we are that God wants to teach us. Truly He upbraids not even as He giveth! Surely there can be no faith, no reliance on God, no waiting, and staying on Him, without an allpervading humility. It is not that human characteristic of an inferiority complex which doubts its Godgiven capability; it is a clear recognition that man at his best state is altogether vanity. It is an intelligent, not particularly emotional trust, a reckoning that anchors deep in believing, persuaded confidence in Him who honors and desires it.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For without faith, it is impossible to please him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+11%3A6" title="Hebrews 11:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 11:6)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>The entire teaching of the Word of God, both in direct statement and in examples, stands behind these thoughts. Any group of people who experience real Divine governorship are characterized by this collective humility and firm faith. It gives rise to utterances such as this: &#8220;God cannot be shut up in a box.&#8221; This means that being led by God means that the Lord will surprise you. Battles that have been won a certain way in the past will not necessarily be won in exactly the same way in the future. Yet sometimes they will. Yet they will always lead to walking closer to God, to true holiness, to a realization of God&#8217;s greatness and power as will reduce the soul to an awed adoration.</p>

<p>As to whether what has just been said is in harmony with the Word of God, we would call your attention to
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ecclesiastes+5%3A1-2">Ecclesiastes 5:1-2</a>:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Keep thy foot <b>when thou goest to the house of God</b>, and <b>be more ready to hear</b>, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil. <b>Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.</b>&#8221;</span>
Surely these words exhort us to lowly-mindedness before God, and encourage a great waiting upon Him. Here we have the Divine prescription for the necessary humility and pliability before God that makes it possible for Him to guide and govern us as He desires. We see so little&#8212;for we are upon the earth, but He sees all that needs to be seen&#8212;for He is in heaven. Therefore we should be quiet and learn how to do, and we should
<span class="scripture">&#8220;keep our foot,&#8221;</span>
that is, be slow to act until we are sure that God actually is leading, especially in the house of God. How solemn the evaluation of those who presume to serve the Almighty with a different attitude&#8212;
<span class="scripture">&#8220;They consider not that they do evil&#8221;</span>!
</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>It is far easier not to be led by the Lord than it is to be led. Yet if we are not led by God, <b>we are going to be led by something.</b> Just where do you think that something-other-than-the-Spirit-of-God will take us? It will certainly be where God would not have us be.</p>

<p>We are very sorry to observe that a great number of religious groups, all claiming Christianity and possessing various degrees of merit, are very much the work of men&#8217;s hands. Some of them start out under the control of the Holy Spirit, but most of them lose Divine government fairly early in their institutional life. One of the great concerns of the folks here in our local congregation is that this not happen to us. We are very interested in retaining the blessing that God has for His people. I have frequently thought, &#8220;What good will it have done to have left a place where men have usurped the government from the most High, only to fall into the same error and be guilty of the same thing?&#8221; It can easily happen. We are leaning hard on the faithfulness of God and His keeping power to stay innocent in His eyes in this matter.</p>

<p>The genius of compromise is that it offers a way for people to be religious and salve their conscience while tolerating carnality of all degrees. An individual does not have to be <i>delivered</i> to be a member in good standing of a compromised group of Christian professors. If a person is really <i>delivered</i> from sin and alive unto God, and <i>consecrates</i> to be a part of a group of people who recognize and accept <i>undelivered</i> professors as genuine and valid, then he or she mars the work of salvation in their heart, gives place to the devil, and sets up the idol of divided love in their affections.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for <b>what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?</b> and what communion hath light with darkness?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+6%3A14" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 6:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 6:14)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>There is only one thing to do to keep clear with the Lord if you are in this situation.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherefore <b>come out from among them, and be ye separate,</b> saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+6%3A17-18" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 6:17-18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 6:17-18)</span></a></span>
Obedience to this commandment requires that we lay aside all leaning to our understanding, that we leave all the consequences, including our spiritual survival, in God&#8217;s hands, that we trust in the Lord with all our heart. The more deeply you have bought into the philosophy of staying within a framework that recognizes and accepts right and wrong together, the harder it will be for you to follow God&#8217;s way and break every yoke that is not of Him.</p>

<p>We personally know a minister, who was much used of God, who kept preaching the truth with liberty and anointing among a certain group of people. At first, this child of God was in harmony with most of the other preachers, for at that time, most of them were also blessed and true. But a great change took place over a number of years, and this one minister became more and more a voice in the wilderness. It did not set well with the ones who were changing. The individual came under more and more criticism. Finally, the minister was accused of sin. The accusation was false, but most of the ministry did not support this innocent child of God. The Holy Spirit preaching from that source was distasteful to them and to the people whom they led. Those who supported the minister of God were not willing to go the point of resigning their place to not compromise with wrong, even though they were sure that the accusation was false. One of them told me that &#8220;it was for the greater good&#8221; that this minister was set down. Whereupon I asked how any good could come from setting down an innocent child of God&#8212;whom clearly God had used and blessed.</p>

<p>This dear child of God, who had faithfully preached the truth, <b>accepted the verdict of a compromise ministry.</b> It brought great bondage and limitation. Instead of being free to go where God would direct, the minister of God was limited to teaching in a certain congregation for two years. This limitation does not make sense on the face of it, for if the ministry of this individual be true and valid, why impose any such limitation at all? And if it is not true, then why recognize any teaching at all?</p>

<p>This true story is an excellent example of the rule of man over the working of God. It is the same spirit that you find in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+21%3A33-44">Matthew 21:33-44</a>.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;We will not have this man [Jesus] to reign over us.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+19%3A14" title="Luke 19:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 19:14)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>It is possible, for a time, at least, to stay saved in such a place and try to walk the fine line between pleasing God and pleasing man, but it will never be very satisfactory. If you please God to a great extent, you will offend
the people with itching ears (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+4%3A3-4">II&nbsp;Timothy 4:3-4</a>),
and you will find that they will take your testimony and bend it to the greater glory of the group,
making merchandise of you (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+2%3A3">II&nbsp;Peter 2:3</a>).
You may will your spiritual energy and strength for the good of the Kingdom of Heaven alone, but you will find that something else will syphon it off. If you lean toward pleasing the people, you will find it taking you farther and farther from what God would have you speak, for unregenerated people who are professing to be all right have no taste for the things of God in actuality. They will say to you,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits: Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+30%3A10-11" title="Isaiah 30:10-11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 30:10-11)</span></a></span>
They will want to be intellectually challenged, or emotionally challenged, or reassured by orthodoxy to a creed. What is allowed that is of God, suffers from limitations. The problem is that they don&#8217;t want what God wants. If you are God&#8217;s man, then they don&#8217;t want you either. You are trying to please two masters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">H. M. Riggle has an article or testimony in which he relates having a bad spell of sickness by blood poisoning, wherein he came near passing over. While in a very low ebb of life he says the Lord made him very conscious of a number of things:</p>

<p>First, there is but one passport to heaven&#8212;the blood of Christ. He saw plainly that he could not rest his hope on labors in gospel work. The blood was the password that opened heaven&#8217;s pearly gates.</p>

<p>Second, for sometime he has seen a trend toward the world in many ways. The plain, saintly-looking pilgrims dressed and appearing as women professing godliness are becoming very few in number. The general appearance of many congregations is the same as found in the old, dead, formal, and proud churches and cannot be distinguished from the theater-goers; and the astonishing thing is that they have let down the line fence entirely and have joined the hellbound masses in the picture shows and theaters. There is a multitude caught in the immigration away from God, and they are whirling along so rapidly that they are completely blinded and unconscious.</p>

<p>He said that he had promised God he would lift up his voice like a trumpet and cry out against the sins of the church as never before.</p>

<p>Over eighteen years ago, the Lord plainly showed me that the <i>Trumpet</i> movement was being swallowed up with worldliness and warned me to loosen from the things, which, by His grace, I did. It may seem strange to some why the Lord did not, or could not, show this thing to H. M. Riggle years ago. <b>The truth of the matter is this: It is hard for one who is much entangled in a thing, and has more or less love for it, to see the thing as it is, and thus he drifts with the tide.</b> The Lord had to get him down to death&#8217;s door before he could get courage enough to publicly speak a thing he said he had been seeing for some years. Now he says he has promised God that he would lift up his voice like a trumpet and cry out against these things. His labors against this will be useless <b>unless he first clears himself from the rubbish,</b> for he helped start the thing when he donned the tie and later endorsed and fellowshipped other things of a worldly nature. The <b>only safe thing for this man to do is to obey</b> the Scriptures found in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+18%3A1-6">Revelation 18, from the first to sixth verses</a>,
which say,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Come out of her, my people.&#8221;</span>
</p>

<p>History proves to us there has never been a movement which has become adulterated with the world that has ever cleansed itself, or been reformed, and come back to a standard of purity and become again separate from the world as Holy People unto God; but on the contrary has become numbered in the
&#8220;valley of dead bones&#8221; (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+37">Ezekiel 37</a>),
and needs to be prophesied to, and not endorsed. A minister&#8217;s preaching has no weight of eternal worth when he himself has on some worldly attire, endorses, or is entangled in the thing he speaks against. My prayer is that God will awaken those who are asleep or at ease in Zion.</p>

<p>The above quotation was first read to me by a minister of a compromised movement who was advocating that it was better to stay in and do all the good that one could do than to leave. As proof of his assertion, he had me read from the book quoted above about H. M. Riggle&#8217;s experience. As published in the book, the quotation above was arrayed on two pages&#8212;and he had just read the first page. Therefore, he thought it supported his contention&#8212;God is able to wake us up and help us to recover and do good where we are&#8212;there is no need to leave. After reading the portion he requested, I noticed that it extended to the next page and asked him if he had read that. He replied that he had not, whereupon I read it. It was devastating to his position. He had nothing left to say. The whole thing had backfired on him. But he did not abandon his false doctrine.</p>

<p>It seems contrary to all good sense and human wisdom to abandon positions of influence or potential influence to launch out in God&#8212;starting over, as it were. It does not readily appear at those moments of crisis how limiting it is to in effect say, &#8220;Lord, I am Your man&#8212;as long as You use me here&#8212;for this has to be right&#8212;and Lord, You must work just right here, as least as far as working through me.&#8221; Do not be surprised if God uses you less and less, for you have partaken of an accursed thing&#8212;group loyalty, a party spirit&#8212;and God abhors such. In truth, can you really say that now you love the Lord with <i>all</i> your heart, soul, mind, and strength?</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">The moment you separate the church of Christ into distinct divisions, you set up the idol of party. Success or adversity will no longer affect the mind simply as they touch the cause of Christ, but they will be felt, also, as affecting &#8220;our side&#8221; or &#8220;our church.&#8221; It is not Christ and His cause to which their whole thoughts and desires are now turned; the idol of party has now been set up, and it claims, and receives, part of their regard. The man, I think, is almost more than human that can wholly avoid this influence, at least after he has been long identified with any branch of the church. It is an influence which is all the time at work. The idol has been set up to divide the heart from the blessed Savior and His holy service; and its influence is as ceaseless as the existence of the cause. And this party feeling is, as we have seen, the essence of all sin, so that sinful desire is blended continually in the heart with its love to Christ, and pollutes the worship which it offers Him.</p>

<p>It mingles poison with the streams of salvation that flow to the soul through the church, and casts a blight upon its budding fruit.</p>

<p>The divisions of Christ&#8217;s people beget and stimulate continually that opposite spirit of rivalry and contention, which is the spirit of the world.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>To conclude, let us state the all-too-often-ignored, but obvious conclusion: <b>Only God can detect the counterfeits of the devil all the time.</b> I remember a certain time in my life when I was thinking, &#8220;I have been taught a lot of Bible truth. It would be difficult for me to be deceived.&#8221; This reasoning sounded quite plausible, and I realize, looking back, that it was endeavoring to induce a certain complacency in my attitude. But God was faithful. He dealt with my heart and caused me to be able to properly divide the sound from the not sound in my thinking. The Lord got it over to me, &#8220;You may not be deceived by a lot of things. <b>But there are things that can deceive you.</b>&#8221; This struck home in me with great force. Then came the scripture in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+24%3A24">Matthew 24:24</a>,
and I saw with great clarity that it was possible for even the elect to be deceived <b>except that God watched over them and they regarded His warnings and admonitions.</b> He is so faithful. He chastises and tries us, deals with us, and warns us. How much He loves us!</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar. Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.</p>

<p>And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters were to the ankles. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to the loins. Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over. And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.</p>

<p>Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other. Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: which being brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed. And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh.</p>

<p>And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon it from Engedi even unto Eneglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many. But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt. And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>In Ezekiel&#8217;s vision, an illustration of spiritual truth is being given. He prophesied during the captivity, and the picture of the temple and the holy city that are described in the latter part of the book of Ezekiel were an allegory of
<span class="scripture">&#8220;a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+8%3A6" title="Hebrews 8:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 8:6)</span></a></span>
These waters that
<span class="scripture">&#8220;issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward&#8221;</span>
are the same as the
<span class="scripture">&#8220;living water&#8221;</span>
Jesus speaks of in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+4%3A10-14">John 4:10-14</a>.
</p>

<p>Let us examine this illustration of the life that Jesus offers and learn. The waters start at the side of the altar, just as the life from Jesus starts at the cross, with His blood shed for us, the
<span class="scripture">&#8220;blood and water&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+19%3A34" title="John 19:34"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 19:34)</span></a></span>
that came from His pierced side, from the side of
<span class="scripture">&#8220;the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+1%3A29" title="John 1:29"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 1:29)</span></a></span>
Except we recognize our sin and repent and turn from it, and receive and believe the blood is effectually shed for us, even us, we cannot be saved. Notice also that it flows out eastward, toward the rising sun.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+4%3A18" title="Proverbs 4:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 4:18)</span></a></span>
and again,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+1%3A19" title="II&nbsp;Peter 1:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 1:19)</span></a></span>
The light and life that Jesus gives is an increasing light, like the dawn.</p>

<p>As we walk with the Lord, we will find that the life He gives us goes deeper and deeper until we shall find that it is no longer a matter of walking, but of swimming&#8212;we can only continue by fully immersing ourselves in Him, trusting Him to carry us along.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+3%3A3" title="Colossians 3:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 3:3)</span></a></span>
A person learning to swim must learn to trust the water&#8217;s buoyancy and cooperate with it, and be willing to take their feet off of the ground. So must we also learn to fully trust in God.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Trust in the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+3%3A5" title="Proverbs 3:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 3:5)</span></a></span></p>

<p>When Ezekiel was returned to the bank, he was put in a position to observe the effects of this life. See how life flourishes along its banks, and how it brings life to the desert! Consider this statement
<span class="scripture">&#8220;every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live.&#8221;</span>
Those that had previously been alive only in a physical sense, now have new life, a spiritual life!</p>

<p>Then we are given a different illustration, that of fishers and fish. Jesus said to Simon and Andrew,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+1%3A17" title="Mark 1:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 1:17)</span></a></span>
This fishing is being done where the Dead Sea was. Just as it would be useless for a commercial fisherman to try to catch anything in the Dead Sea unless an influx of fresh water brought new life to it, so unless we dwell hidden in Christ, and fish for men as the Lord is sending His living waters that way, it will be an unproductive exercise. And see yet further:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But the miry places thereof and the marishes [marshes] thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt.&#8221;</span>
Life will not come by mixing spiritual life and truth with dead earth (human ideas and wisdom). Miry places and marshes are where water and earth attempt to &#8220;share&#8221; the same places. The mixing of God&#8217;s Truth with human wisdom doesn&#8217;t work, and neither does the mixing of spiritual life with the self-life. We must let the &#8220;water&#8221; have full sway.</p>

<p>Finally, see the fruitfulness of the lives that are drawn from the river. Both nourishment and healing come out of these lives.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+1%3A3" title="Psalm 1:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 1:3)</span></a></span>
Oh, God&#8217;s way is best! God&#8217;s way gives life! Let us give ourselves wholeheartedly to God!</p>

<h1>&#8220;I Write Unto You, Young Men&#8221;</h1>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first"><span class="scripture">&#8220;I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+2%3A14" title="I&nbsp;John 2:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 2:14)</span></a></span></p>
</div>


<hr class="minor" />
<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles&#8217; hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+8%3A18-19" title="Acts 8:18-19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 8:18-19)</span></a></span></p>

<p>It says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;he offered them money.&#8221;</span>
Money is the medium of temporal life, and temporal transactions. When the temporal life rules, the spiritual not only doesn&#8217;t rule, it is not even understood. He thought that this was a power the apostles &#8220;owned,&#8221; and could somehow transfer for temporal gain. He was very self-focused:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Give <i>me</i>&#8230;&#8203;that on whomsoever <i>I</i>&#8230;.&#8221;</span>
This is a grim and tragic picture of the heart
<span class="scripture">&#8220;not right in the sight of God,&#8221;</span>
as Brother Peter, who was spiritual, discerned immediately.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m thinking, young men, of the tension between the spiritual and temporal sides of life, particularly in the realm of money. We live in this world, and must deal in the &#8220;medium of temporal life&#8221; all the time of our pilgrimage down here. How can we deal with it as our temporal lives require, and avoid such disasters as came upon Simon? This is the burden of my heart in writing to you.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+6%3A9-10" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 6:9-10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 6:9-10)</span></a></span></p>

<p>What is this thing that is so awful and terrible to love&#8212;pieces of paper or metal? When we speak of
<span class="scripture">&#8220;the love of money,&#8221;</span>
what we really mean is the love of what money represents and gives&#8212;the power to get the things of the temporal life. The scripture,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But they that will be rich,&#8221;</span>
instructs us that it is not the condition of being &#8220;rich,&#8221; but the motivation and intent in that direction, that is ruinous. The poorest man can fall into this snare as well as the richest. If you or I say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be rich, I just want $___ more each month,&#8221; what we are seeking is more of what money gives. Yes, things would go a bit smoother in the temporal realm; yes, I would feel less cramped in my temporal affairs,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But godliness with contentment is great gain.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+6%3A6" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 6:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 6:6)</span></a></span>
The Lord knows all our needs and wants, and has them <b>in correct priority</b>. God has stated the very high value of contentment, and it is closely tied to trust in God and humility.</p>

<p>People are ever prone to ungodly imbalance. With the above counsel in mind, it is still your responsibility, young men, to learn to provide for yourselves, and likely, one day, a family. It certainly takes more to provide for a family than for one person alone, and many of you young men are still dependent on your parents for your sustenance. Jesus addresses us carefully in this matter:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man&#8217;s, who shall give you that which is your own? No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him. And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+16%3A10-15" title="Luke 16:10-15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 16:10-15)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;&#8230;&#8203;in that which is least&#8230;&#8203;also in much.&#8221;</span>
Do you understand that how you handle the responsibilities of taking out the garbage, that minimum-wage job, and that boring, little homework assignment are determining your future? This isn&#8217;t just a saying parents use to try to get their children to work harder&#8212;it is the Word of God. Let us look further:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;&#8230;&#8203;the unrighteous mammon&#8230;&#8203;the true riches.&#8221;</span>
Our approach to temporal life affects the spiritual life. Faithfulness and responsibility in temporal matters prepares us to receive spiritual riches. The story of every child of God starts, continues and ends with their faithful response to God&#8217;s dealings with them, from the point of recognizing their need of salvation to the &#8220;little&#8221; daily obediences of the saved person to &#8220;obedience unto death.&#8221; The one who has taken seriously the responsibilities of handling money and the temporal matters of life is better equipped to take seriously the responsibilities of the spiritual matters of life.</p>

<p>Jesus then makes clear the relationship between the temporal and spiritual. &#8220;Mammon,&#8221; the god of earthly riches, is in implacable conflict with God. It is necessary, in becoming faithful in temporal matters, to be stewards of earthly riches, and not servants to them. It is by managing our temporal lives as stewards before God that we keep things in their proper place, and that only by the grace of God. Jesus&#8217; statement,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;that which is highly esteemed among men,&#8221;</span>
suggests that the Pharisees were the admirable, model citizens of their time. The sort of people that &#8220;good neighborhoods&#8221; consisted of, that parents wanted their children to grow up like, etc., etc. But they were covetous.</p>

<p>It is only by humbly walking with God that you can be faithful in temporal matters without them taking hold of you and ruling you. It is only by humbly walking with God that you can avoid doing things that men regard highly but are an
<span class="scripture">&#8220;abomination in the sight of God.&#8221;</span>
</p>

<p>Let us consider, now, some instruction regarding the use of temporal things.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man is precious.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+12%3A27" title="Proverbs 12:27"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 12:27)</span></a></span></p>

<p>The difference here is between the hunter who is simply hunting for pleasure and the hunter who recognizes that he is a steward, and is providing meat in the hunting. Let&#8217;s extrapolate a little here. In my vocation, or any of the smaller decisions I make in temporal matters, am I primarily looking to enjoy myself, or am I providing for the temporal needs of life? Much has been written in recent times on the importance of enjoying your work, but if our home is in heaven, and we desire to live with the spiritual ruling over the temporal, then we must recognize that its primary purpose is to gain us a livelihood, a means to an end. If we let the Lord lead us, He will lead us into a vocation and the temporal situations in life in which we can be happy, by His grace.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Much food is in the tillage of the poor: but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+13%3A23" title="Proverbs 13:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 13:23)</span></a></span></p>

<p>This gives us an insight into one of the causes (certainly not the only cause) of poverty. Learning to make good use of what we have, and learning good judgment in the use of what money comes our way, makes far more difference in how we fare temporally than most realize. I remember a famous sports star had planned to retire, but found himself nearly bankrupt through poor management of his money (in this case, in how his millions had been invested), and kept on playing several more years than he had intended to restore his financial situation. I know of highly paid professionals who can&#8217;t save up to avoid buying on credit, and I know of people who have very limited means that make their own lot far more difficult than it need be through lack of self-control and mismanagement. I know of others who are poor in this world&#8217;s eyes, but have found &#8220;much food&#8221; in their &#8220;tillage,&#8221; and get by better than others who earn a lot more.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of every one that is hasty only to want.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+21%3A5" title="Proverbs 21:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 21:5)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Notice the contrast here between the &#8220;diligent&#8221; and the &#8220;hasty.&#8221; Have you had very many encounters with sellers of this world&#8217;s goods and services where you are urged to take lots of time to carefully consider the purchase decision, and to be sure to wait until you can afford it and really need it? When I come to the checkout counter at a store, I am often asked if I found everything I needed, but I can&#8217;t recall ever being asked if I had taken time to consider whether I really needed and could afford whatever was in my cart or hands. This being the case, young man, should you not set yourself against the natural flow and be diligent to find your own places of natural &#8220;hastiness,&#8221; and resist them? Almost all the advertising that we are exposed to weighs in on the side of hastiness. Ask the Lord to teach you how to face this challenge to sober, godly living.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+28%3A20" title="Proverbs 28:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 28:20)</span></a></span></p>

<p>We live in an age of shortcuts. We are ever looking for a quicker way to get places, accomplish things, or do a task. There are &#8220;shortcuts to success,&#8221; and so much of the thrust of our information age is on getting answers quicker, accomplishing things quicker, and finding shortcuts to satisfying our wants. There is a place for seeking greater productivity, for using our time more effectively, for not wasting effort, but the predominance of this adds to the tendency toward haste. Faithfulness takes time. Faithfulness is often inconvenient. Faithfulness frequently slows us down. But faithfulness is approved of God.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;A faithful man shall abound with blessings.&#8221;</span>
A person I know was referred to as &#8220;a pillar of the community&#8221; by a co-worker. This person&#8217;s own testimony was that the things that led to this co-worker referring to him that way were acts that were difficult, painful, and humiliating. There were times God had shown him that he needed to go apologize and make things right, to go back and do something over, to do things he didn&#8217;t want to do. In other words, this &#8220;reputation&#8221; was really no reflection on him, but on God&#8217;s faithful dealings with him, and his humbling himself to respond.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die: Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me: Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+30%3A7-9" title="Proverbs 30:7-9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 30:7-9)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Poverty and riches are both vanity&#8212;they both obscure and &#8220;lie&#8221; to us about the real state of things, and they both have their peculiar temptations. Let us return to the incident we read about at the beginning of this article: Peter and John were in a spiritual condition to be a benefit to the new believers in Samaria&#8212;they knew well the utter worthlessness of temporal riches in the spiritual realm, and they knew they were stewards, and didn&#8217;t &#8220;own&#8221; these gifts to sell, anyway. They knew that they weren&#8217;t poor when they had the Lord as their master. They were diligent in what the Lord gave them to do, and trusted Him to take care of their needs. Let us bear in mind, young men, the real standard of poverty. We are inclined to think we are poor if we find ourselves inconvenienced a lot. The scripture addresses us thus:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+6%3A7-8" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 6:7-8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 6:7-8)</span></a></span>
That is the true standard of having
<span class="scripture">&#8220;neither poverty nor riches.&#8221;</span>
Young men, I charge you as Paul charged Timothy:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A7" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 2:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 2:7)</span></a></span></p>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">Many times, incidents from human warfare illustrate aspects of our spiritual warfare. This incident from the Civil War, related by Major Whittle, an officer of the Union army, was just such a one. Those of you who are history buffs, please excuse any historical inaccuracies.

<hr />
<p><i>It was in 1864 on the morning of October 5th&#8212;I&#8217;ll never forget that date&#8212;I think that was one of the closest shaves we ever had. I was assigned to the regiment commanded by General Corse. It was situated in a post surrounded by earthworks on a hill, on the crest of which was a small fort. The place was called Allatoona Pass, down near Atlanta. Everything seemed comparatively peaceful for a change, when suddenly, one of my sub officers came running up to me&#8230;.</i></p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Lieutenant: Major Whittle, sir, Major Whittle!</p>

<p>Whittle: Well, yes, lieutenant?</p>

<p>Lieutenant: Come over here, sir!</p>

<p>Whittle: What is it? I can&#8217;t leave my station.</p>

<p>Lieutenant: The enemy, sir.</p>

<p>Whittle: What?!</p>

<p>Lieutenant: Yes, sir! Thousands of them.</p>

<p>Whittle: Impossible! General Sherman is stationed over there, on that other hill, with his entire army.</p>

<p>Lieutenant: If you think it&#8217;s impossible, sir, you just come with me.</p>

<p>Whittle: Huh! Very well, come along, I&#8217;ll have a look.</p>

<p>Lieutenant: Take this spyglass, sir. Look over there, down in that valley.</p>

<p>Whittle: Hmm, you&#8217;re right, Lieutenant! I&#8217;ll tell General Corse at once.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Corse: Why, that can&#8217;t be, Major; it&#8217;s not possible!</p>

<p>Whittle: But it is, sir! There seems to be quite a sizable force out there.</p>

<p>Corse: But General Sherman&#8230;.</p>

<p>Whittle: That&#8217;s what I thought, too, General Corse. I wouldn&#8217;t have believed it if I hadn&#8217;t seen it with my own eyes.</p>

<p>Corse: Hmm, quite a force, you say?</p>

<p>Whittle: Yes, sir!</p>

<p>Corse: And here we are, with some of the most valuable supplies of the Union Army in our care, and only 1500 men to combat&#8230;&#8203;[<i>knock at the door</i>]. Come. [<i>a sergeant enters</i>] Yes, Sergeant.</p>

<p>Sergeant: A confederate officer is approaching, sir. He&#8217;s bearing a white flag.</p>

<p>Corse: Oh, I see. Very well. Come on, Major Whittle. We&#8217;ll soon see what this is all about. [<i>they come to the gate</i>]. Open that gate to receive an officer of the enemy. Attention!</p>

<p>[<i>a Confederate Captain comes galloping in on horseback, and reins up in front of the general</i>]</p>

<p>Captain: General Corse?</p>

<p>Corse: I am General Corse.</p>

<p>Captain: I enter your fortification under terms of temporary truce, sir.</p>

<p>Corse: Yes.</p>

<p>Captain: I bear the compliments of General French, commanding a brigade of 6,000 men of the Confederate Army. General French commands me to inform you, sir, that you are completely surrounded by his forces.</p>

<p>Corse: Surrounded? Any further word from General French?</p>

<p>Captain: Yes, sir. He bids me to command you to surrender, sir.</p>

<p>Corse: Hmm. I presume General French will not be surprised to hear of my irrevocable refusal.</p>

<p>Captain: I&#8217;m sure he won&#8217;t, sir.</p>

<p>Corse: You may tell General French that as long as there is a man of us alive, there will be no surrender.</p>

<p>Captain: I shall carry your message to him immediately, sir.</p>

<p>Corse: Uh, just before you leave&#8230;.</p>

<p>Captain: Yes, sir?</p>

<p>Corse: Would you mind telling me how General French accomplished this maneuver?</p>

<p>Captain: Not at all, sir. General Hood passed the right flank of General Sherman&#8217;s federal forces yesterday, and gained the rear of his lines. Several of your garrisons have been destroyed, and the railroad to the north burned.</p>

<p>Whittle: Ghaa!</p>

<p>Corse: Major!&#8230;&#8203;Go on, sir.</p>

<p>Captain: Naturally, General Sherman was forced to send his army after General Hood. While he was so occupied, General French made the left flank maneuver, and&#8212;well, sir, here we are.</p>

<p>Corse: Hmm. Yes, so I see. Very well, you may also communicate this to General French. The next move will be his.</p>

<p>Captain: I understand, sir. Thank you, sir. [<i>gallops off</i>]</p>

<p>Corse: Close the gate! Come with me, Major Whittle. Not that I doubt the word of that young Confederate Captain, but I&#8217;d just like to see for myself. We&#8217;ll go to the other side of the fort&#8212;simply to find out just how much we are surrounded.</p>

<p>Whittle: Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Corse: At ease, men! [<i>they go to investigate</i>] Well, well. So Sherman has been outwitted at last! Heh, heh.</p>

<p>Whittle: General Corse, sir! How can you laugh at a crisis like this?</p>

<p>Corse: Ah, yes. There they are, Major. The enemy.</p>

<p>Whittle: Thousands of them!</p>

<p>Corse: Uh, six thousand, I believe the captain said.</p>

<p>[<i>the Confederates begin firing on their fortification</i>]</p>

<p>Whittle: They&#8217;ve started firing, sir. What shall we do?</p>

<p>Corse: Do? Do! Why give the command to return the fire, of course.</p>

<p>Whittle: Yes, sir. [<i>to another officer</i>] Commence firing. [<i>the order is passed on and the sounds of battle commence</i>]</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p><i>Throughout the long, harrowing day, the sharp fighting continued. With ever-decreasing ammunition and depleted forces, General Corse and his men were impelled to retreat to the small fort at the crest of the hill. There, they barricaded themselves within the cramped enclosure, to await what seemed to be an inevitable fate of death or capture. Then, as the worn and haggard regiment of General Corse fought on through that painfully disheartening October afternoon&#8230;.</i></p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Whittle: General Corse, General Corse, sir.</p>

<p>Corse: Yes, what is it, Major?</p>

<p>Whittle: We can&#8217;t hold out much longer, sir.</p>

<p>Corse: Major Whittle, you heard what I told that young Confederate captain, that as long as there stood a man of us here in Allatoona Pass, there would be no surrender.</p>

<p>Whittle: I know, sir, but&#8212;</p>

<p>Corse: That&#8217;s enough of that, sir. You&#8217;re an officer of the Union, Major. Your duty is clear.</p>

<p>Whittle: I&#8212;I&#8217;m sorry, sir.</p>

<p>[<i>a lieutenant calls</i>]</p>

<p>Lieutenant: General Corse, sir!</p>

<p>Corse: Yes, Lieutenant.</p>

<p>Lieutenant: One of my men reported seeing a signal flag from that hill yonder, sir.</p>

<p>Corse: A signal? Where?</p>

<p>Lieutenant: Off to the south, sir. There!</p>

<p>Corse: Have you your glass, Major?</p>

<p>Whittle: Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Corse: Try to find that signal.</p>

<p>Whittle: Yes, sir. [<i>pause</i>] I see it, sir! I see it!</p>

<p>Corse: Signal light handy?</p>

<p>Whittle: Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Corse: Signal, we are ready to receive.</p>

<p>Whittle: Yes, sir. They are coming back with a message, General Corse.</p>

<p>Corse: Read it as they send. Men! Listen!</p>

<p>Whittle: S H E R M A N&#8212;T O&#8212;C O R S E&#8212;</p>

<p>Corse: Sherman to Corse! [<i>men start cheering</i>] Wait, men, wait!</p>

<p>Whittle: H O L D&#8212;T H E&#8212;F O R T&#8212;I&#8212;A M&#8212;C O M I N G.</p>

<p>Corse: Hold the fort, I am coming! [<i>wild cheering</i>]</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p><i>Well, the rest of that October day wasn&#8217;t a pretty one. We still had more than three hours to wait. More than half of our garrison were killed or wounded. But at last, the advance guard of Sherman&#8217;s army came up, and the Confederate forces of General French retired in retreat.</i></p>

<h1>A Woman&#8217;s Place</h1>

<p>Every little girl loves to dream of her wedding day&#8230;. The ceremony may differ from girl to girl, but one single desire expresses itself in every girl&#8217;s dream: she wants her wedding to be a beautiful one.</p>

<p>And that is as it should be. God intended that every little girl should be able to dream of a beautiful wedding, and a truly beautiful marriage. He placed that dream in orbit on the sixth day of creation, when the world was very new.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God said: It is not good that man should be alone. I will make an help meet for him&#8230;. And the rib which the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man&#8230;. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+2%3A18%2C22%2C24" title="Genesis 2:18,22,24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 2:18,22,24)</span></a></span>
This is the sacred story of the very first marriage. Jesus quoted God&#8217;s law in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+19%3A5">Matthew 19:5</a>,
adding in verse 6,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+19%3A6" title="Matthew 19:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 19:6)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Because it was first her Heavenly Father&#8217;s dream, every little girl can continue to dream of the husband and home she will have one day. This is not a selfish aspiration; it is a high and holy ambition, if God&#8217;s plan is understood and honored.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;It is not good for man to be alone.&#8221;</span>
When God in His Wisdom made that profound declaration, He was paying every woman the highest compliment she could ever receive. <i>Because man needed her, God made woman.</i> She has been fashioned by the Foremost Designer to be an appropriate helper for her husband. Hers is no minor role. <i>It is permanent, significant, and, yes, glamorous.</i></p>

<h2>Permanent</h2>
<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Love is strong as death&#8230;. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Song+8%3A6-7" title="Song 8:6-7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Song 8:6-7)</span></a></span>
Christ said,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+19%3A9" title="Matthew 19:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 19:9)</span></a></span>
The marriage vow is for life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Perhaps the greatest blessing in marriage is that it lasts so long. The years, like the varying interests of each year, combine to buttress and enrich each other. Out of many shared years, one life. In a series of temporary relationships, one misses the ripening, gathering, harvesting joys, the deep hard-won truths of marriage.</p>

<p>&#8212;Richard C. Cabot</p>

</blockquote>


<h2>Significant</h2>
<p>History teaches us that there is no substitute for righteous wives and mothers if we are to have righteous nations. It is not by accident that Sarah, Jochabed, Hannah, Elizabeth, and Eunice had courageous husbands and faithful sons. They were women of great courage and faith. Might not the record of Ahab, Lot, and Annanias have read differently, but for Jezebel, Lot&#8217;s wife and Sapphira?</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">The ideal which the wife and mother makes for herself, the manner in which she understands duty and life, contain the fate of the community. Her faith becomes the star of the conjugal ship, and her love the animating principle that fashions the future of all belonging to her. Woman is the salvation or destruction of the family. She carries its destinies in the folds of her mantle.</p>

<p>&#8212;Henri F. Amiel</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Of all human relationships, there are none more enduring than those of family and home. Of all human endeavors, there is none more significant than that of a wife-mother-homemaker.</p>

<h2>Glamorous</h2>
<p>It is the most love-centered of all professions. Its pre-requisites are only the feminine qualities of warmth, generosity, and understanding. Only the truly lovely can qualify.</p>

<p>An appreciative husband wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="verse first">Brightest truth,<br />purest trust in the universe&#8230;.<br />all were for me<br />In the kiss of one girl.</p>

<p>&#8212;Robert Browning</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Another famous poet lyricized the glamour of marriage in these words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="verse first">There&#8217;s a bliss beyond all that the minstrel has told,
<br />When two, that are link&#8217;d in one heavenly tie,
<br />With heart never changing, and brow never cold,
<br />Love on through all ills, and love on till they die.</p>

<p class="verse">One hour of a passion so sacred is worth
<br />Whole ages of heartless and wandering bliss;
<br />And oh! if there be an Elysium on earth,
<br />It is this&#8212;it is this!</p>

<p>&#8212;Thomas Moore</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The dictionary defines <i>glamour</i> as &#8220;fascination, enchantment, charm.&#8221; Of all careers for women, there is none more glamorous than the permanent and significant career of &#8220;an help meet&#8221; for man.</p>

<p><i>When both husband and wife recognize the Hand of God in the creation of wife for husband, the marriage relationship becomes beautiful indeed.</i> Neither self-seeking nor self-sufficiency can survive in such a healthy environment. For the wife finds fulfillment in knowing she is needed&#8212;who does not need to be needed? The husband gains strength by acknowledging weakness. Because each one without the other is incomplete, both can say with the One who made them so, &#8220;It is not good for man to be alone.&#8221; And every faithful wife will add her own prayer-size postscript, &#8220;Thank you, Dear Father, for placing me right where I want to be&#8212;by his side!&#8221;</p>

<p><i>From this day forward.</i> On her wedding day, the bride takes her place beside the man she loves, to be his companion, his complement, his counterpart. The past becomes a shadowy backdrop of figures, facts, and faces&#8212;important only because they somehow helped to shape the present exciting moment. The future is all now. And it is for two:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="verse first">&#8230;&#8203;I feel that I shall stand
<br />Henceforward in thy shadow. Nevermore
<br />Alone upon the threshold of my door
<br />Of individual life, I shall command
<br />The uses of my soul, nor lift my hand
<br />Serenely in the sunshine as before,
<br />Without the sense of that which I forbore&#8212;
<br />Thy touch upon the palm. The widest land
<br />Doom takes to part us, leaves thy heart in mine
<br />With pulses that beat double. What I do
<br />And what I dream include thee, as the wine
<br />Must taste of its own grapes. And when I sue
<br />God for myself, He hears that name of thine,
<br />And sees within my eyes the tears of two.</p>

<p>&#8212;Elizabeth Barrett Browning</p>

<li>1/4 c. kelp powder</li>

<li>1 t. cayenne pepper</li>

<li>2 heaping T. salt</li>

<li>1 T. @ of:</li>

<li>parsley flakes</li>

<li>celery leaves</li>

<li>marjoram leaves</li>

<li>savory leaves</li>

<li>1 t. onion powder</li>

<li>1 t. Brewer&#8217;s or nutritional yeast (<b>not</b> baker&#8217;s yeast)</li>

<li>2 t. paprika</li>

</ul>
<p>Run in a food processor until very fine. Put in a shaker and keep handy. You only reach for one shaker-it&#8217;s all there, salt, pepper and other good things. It&#8217;s especially good on fried eggs and hamburgers. If you don&#8217;t have all the dried herbs, that is okay, just use what you have.</p>

<h2>Ground Turkey Seasoning</h2>
<p>Ever been attracted to the price of ground turkey but have not liked the taste? Try this in any dish that uses hamburger. You will be pleased with <i>the flavor</i>!</p>

<p>Brown:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>1 pound turkey</li>

</ul>
<p>Toward the end of browning add:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>2-3 cloves minced garlic</li>

<li>1 t. sage</li>

<li>1/2 t. salt</li>

<li>1/4 t. pepper</li>

<li>1/2 t. chili powder</li>

<li>1 t. paprika</li>

<li>1/4-1/2 t. crushed red pepper</li>

</ul>
<p>Brown an additional 5 minutes.</p>

<h2>Fish Coating</h2>
<p>My husband did not enjoy fish until this recipe was developed from the ingredient list of a commercial fish coating.</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>1/2 c. semolina flour</li>

<li>1/3 c. corn flour</li>

<li>1/4 c. white flour</li>

<li>1 t. salt, slightly heaped</li>

<li>1/4 t. cayenne pepper, heaping</li>

<li>1/4 t. garlic powder</li>

<li>1/4 t. onion powder</li>

<li>1/8 t. nutmeg</li>

</ul>
<hr class="minor" />
<h2>Chicken Coating</h2>
<p>An old stand-by from a cookbook my mother gave me as a girl.</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>1 c. flour</li>

<li>2 t. salt</li>

<li>1/4 t. pepper</li>

<li>2 t. paprika</li>

</ul>
<p>This was intended for oven-fried chicken. After coating chicken, then dip in melted margarine. Sprinkling chicken with sesame seeds gives it additional interest as well as nutrition. Who doesn&#8217;t enjoy chicken nuggets? Using an electric knife, cut chicken breast in nugget size. Coat and fry in hot oil just a few minutes or until golden.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<h2>Popcorn Seasoning</h2>
<p>Ever put lots of good seasoning on popcorn and most of it ends up at the bottom of the bowl? Just put all the seasoning in the melted butter or olive oil! It works wonderfully and is so delicious!</p>

</ul>
<p>Blend in:</p>

<ul class="recipe">

</ul>
<p>Pop 2/3 cup of corn and pour butter mixture over and serve with sliced apples.</p>

<h2>Seasoning Simplified</h2>
<p>E. S.</p>

<p class="verse">There once was an innovative cook
<br />Who wrote a volume on how to
<br />Cook without a cookbook!</p>

<p class="verse">Her rule was simple, as you will see.
<br />She listed different kinds of cuisine,
<br />And what their seasonings should be.</p>

<p class="verse">Let&#8217;s take Mexican food for example.
<br />Add chili powder, garlic, onion and jalapeno.
<br />Now you&#8217;re welcome to take a sample!</p>

<p class="verse">Dry beans&#8212;of variety, there is a lot.
<br />So easy to cook; salt only when tender.
<br />Garlic, savory, pepper and bay leaf, forget not.</p>

<p class="verse">To prepare food for which Italians go,
<br />Pasta, olive oil, meat, tomato sauce and veggies.
<br />Add garlic, parsley, basil and oregano.</p>

<p class="verse">Steam rice in advance and brown later, say the Chinese.
<br />They enjoy cabbage, garlic, soy sauce and sprouts.
<br />For special flavor, add a little oil of sesame.</p>

<p class="verse">From this simple theory,
<br />It is very plain to see,
<br />That cooking is not as hard as it appears to be.</p>

<h1>Where Is My Beloved Gone?</h1>

<p>Does it seem that God is far away at times? You pray, but nothing seems to happen? If that is the case and you have invited the Lord Jesus to assist you in searching your life for anything displeasing to Him, then the Lord could be testing you. He wants to prove to Himself and to you that you are set to do His will. What kind of fruit is He going to find?</p>

<p>
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Song+of+Solomon+6%3A1">Song of Solomon 6:1</a>
says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.&#8221;</span>
Isn&#8217;t that exactly our human sentiments at times? Sometimes when we need Him so much, He seems to have gone away. But, oh, no, that is not the case! Verse two says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;My beloved is gone down into his garden.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Song+6%3A2" title="Song 6:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Song 6:2)</span></a></span>
Is not our hearts that He has cleansed, His garden? He gave His life&#8217;s blood that new life may spring forth. In the newly-tilled soil of our souls, He plants righteousness and peace and purity. What a precious thought to know that He then comes down into our hearts to inspect and see how His plants are growing. At the times when it seems He is so far off, He is actually very close.</p>

<p>Have we been feeding on another area of His garden&#8212;His word, so His plantings will thrive, or are they being starved and becoming shriveled and dried up? The scripture says He comes into His garden &#8220;to the beds of spices.&#8221; Now spices are of little value unless they are crushed to bring out the flavor and fragrance. Do some things in your life seem to crush you? Let Jesus have His sweet way in all circumstances, then He can gather the sweetness He was desiring when He allowed the trial.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Song+4%3A16" title="Song 4:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Song 4:16)</span></a></span>
The devil can certainly blow big, giant winds of doubt and despair, until we feel crushed. Are we going to get a hold of the keys in His Word to conquer so there will be spices? Are you getting the good the Master Gardener designed from the crushing circumstances? Remember, He only has good in mind for you.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;My beloved is gone down&#8230;&#8203;to feed.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Song+6%3A2" title="Song 6:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Song 6:2)</span></a></span>
What does the Lord feed on? Remember Jesus at the well after having talked to the Samaratian woman. The disciples returned from the town with food and Jesus told them,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I have meat to eat that ye know not of.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+4%3A32" title="John 4:32"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 4:32)</span></a></span>
His meat was for the kingdom of God to be increased. There is the parable of the fig tree. Jesus approached it, and there was nothing to eat. It had borne nothing. Is there something for the Lord to eat in your heart when He condescends to feed in your garden? Is there an increasing of spiritual life in our hearts?</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Foundation_Truth_8/beloved_lily.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="281" /></div>
<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;My beloved is gone down&#8230;&#8203;to gather lilies.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Song+6%3A2" title="Song 6:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Song 6:2)</span></a></span>
Most of us women really enjoy flowers. Have you found the enjoyment of gathering beautiful blossoms and creating a bouquet to set on the table for everyone&#8217;s pleasure? Maybe we can in a small measure understand how Jesus craves to come and gather lilies from our heart&#8217;s garden.</p>

<p>A lily is very beautiful. In saying something is like a lily, it is referring to whiteness, purity and delicacy. How we need to guard our thoughts and actions, that there will only be pure things for our Beloved to gather. The dictionary has some very interesting things to say about the word <i>delicacy</i>, that will grow beautifully in the spiritual garden. Let&#8217;s consider them carefully.</p>

<ol>
<li>a sensitive distaste for what is considered improper or offensive.</li>

<li>a fine regard for the feelings of others.</li>

<li>a sensitiveness of response.</li>

</ol>
<p>Oh, yes, how careful we need to be, not to offend our Lord. And how quickly we need to respond to the calling of our Master.</p>

<p>We pray this will be an encouragement to study more how to be like a lily in whiteness, purity and delicacy, to feed upon the Word that your garden may flourish. And when the Lord allows crushing things to come your way, know that God is there to gather the spices of contentment and peace and hope from your heart.</p>

<p>May God bless and encourage you.</p>

<h1>Luka&#8217;s Itchy Head</h1>

<p>A couple of children, Luka and Nakeysha, who were being schooled at our home, needed to spend some nights with us for a time, as their mother had started a new job and had to work late in the evenings. Sleeping bags and clothes were brought, and a space in our living area was designated their little &#8220;bedroom.&#8221;</p>

<p>About half way into their six-week stay in our home, Luka began to complain of his head itching. The dreaded thought crossed our mind, &#8220;Maybe he has head lice.&#8221; His head was checked, but nothing was found. A week later he was still scratching, so we checked again; but, no, we didn&#8217;t find anything and thought perhaps he just had an itchy head.</p>

<p>Luka continued to scratch, until one night he announced that he had bumps in his head! A prayer went up from our heart, &#8220;Oh, Lord, help us to find what is wrong with this child&#8217;s head.&#8221; A bright light was arranged, and the search began. About five minutes later, something was found! Was this the dreaded &#8220;head lice&#8221; we hear about? The microscope was brought out; sure enough, all doubt was removed. No wonder this child&#8217;s head had been itching! All those little legs crawling around! To say nothing of the bites! Five were found that night and many, many nits (eggs).</p>

<p>We thought back across the years that we had taken care of neighbor children. At one other time, we&#8217;d had a close call and we had thanked the Lord for His protection. Now it looked like the Lord might be allowing us to have a greater trial. How could the rest of the family escape? Maybe some of us already have it?! Our heads itched just thinking about it!</p>

<p>The next morning, a sister came over and helped me clean, vacuum, do washing, and put various things in bags. And we prayed, &#8220;Oh, Lord, if it could be Your will, would You protect the rest of us from getting the lice.&#8221; Different reports of others having it in their homes were not very encouraging. It always seemed like a long, hard battle. Calls were made to those with experience to glean helpful information. I was really impressed with one family who eradicated it very quickly. The one infected wore a shower cap to keep it from spreading. One mother shared a homemade recipe for killing the lice which worked better than the store-bought products.</p>

<p>The ingredients were brought out and mixed up:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>2 T. mayonnaise</li>

<li>2 T. Vaseline</li>

<li>1 T. cider vinegar</li>

</ul>
<p>and applied to Luka&#8217;s head. It was to stay for 20-30 minutes, but to make sure the lice were suffocated, some additional minutes were added. Then began the many washings to get out that greasy mixture. But it worked. His mother later gave the treatment again, so he got a double dose! The itching stopped, and it&#8217;s been many months with no return. And none of our family got it, either. It really seemed like a miracle when we thought back on how long his head had been itching. When we thought of the close contact there had been in teaching, reading stories, sitting on the couches and chairs, it was truly a miracle from Heaven that we were spared. We truly do thank the Lord for answering our prayers to Him for help. He was our
<span class="scripture">&#8220;help in time of need.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A16" title="Hebrews 4:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 4:16)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The homemade recipe called for Natural Cleanser to spray on after the treatment. It may be bought at a drug store. Spray it on and comb out with a nit comb. Then shampoo. We didn&#8217;t have it, so used dish washing soap several times, and then shampoo.</p>

<h1>&#8220;Life&#8217;s Secret Comes from Within&#8221;</h1>

<p>This little writing hung on the wall in a simple brown frame. The husband and wife had read it at different times and gained strength and courage. The last time they had read it together, his loving arm across her shoulder, he commented, &#8220;You know, honey, of all the things your mother has given us, I appreciate this the most.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">There is a secret of living that, if I can teach it to my daughter, I feel it will be the most important thing I can teach her. It is that happiness and contentment come not from what she has but from her attitude toward life.</p>

<p>I want her to appreciate all the simple things, most of which cost no money, yet make life richer&#8212;family love, good health, the beauties of nature, lovely attributes of character, friendship, God&#8217;s love as shown in His provision for us. I want her to learn contentment with what she has while she strives toward a better standard of living and a more perfect character. I want her to get all the joy possible out of now and not look back at some future time and say regretfully, &#8220;I wish I had realized how blessed I was then, how much I had to be thankful for, how lovely my life was then.&#8221;</p>

<p>If she can learn to look for positive value, the assets of each situation or period of life, she will have happiness through life. It will never be what she has that will make her happy, but her attitude and the way she meets life&#8217;s situations, be they triumphant or discouraging.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Thank you, Mother!</p>

<h1>Honey in the Rock</h1>

<p>A battle had been borne all week with a lazy student. Each afternoon had been given to finishing last weekend&#8217;s homework. Friday morning was upon us and thoughts were coming to our mind of all the &#8220;baby-sitting&#8221; we had had to do with this student to accomplish the needed material. The devil was bringing up all the things that were begging to be done that could have been accomplished in that time. A royal battle was on hand in the mind, and a place of prayer was sought to deal with the darts of the enemy.</p>

<p>After a while my husband opened the door and said they were all waiting for devotions. With a continued prayer in my heart for the Lord&#8217;s grace and help, I arose and joined them. The devotions were on forgiveness. The parable of the man who had been forgiven a great deal, who then in turn would not forgive a man who owed him only a little bit. Yes, I needed to forgive this student.</p>

<p>As I forgave, the enemy had to flee. Then a thought came, that I was sure would be a good motivator. At the proper time it was then employed, and it was amazing what that student accomplished!</p>

<p>In pondering, we can see the attack of the enemy&#8212;the hard place, but when met with the power and favor of God, deliverance came and our souls were satisfied and honey was found from the rock (Psalms 81:16). How we praise God for His help!</p>

<p>The following morning the song <a href="../../../music/Honey_in_the_Rock/index.html" title="Honey in the Rock">Honey in the Rock</a> rang in our heart and voice. Do you know the song? Perhaps someday when the devil is throwing his darts, you, too, will then find grace and help and honey from the hard places you meet.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_8/Boot_Camp_for_Service_Your_Home/index.html">Boot Camp for Service: Your Home</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Boot Camp for Service: Your Home</h1>

<p>Home. What does that bring to your mind? Comfort, belonging, love, and care. Or perhaps authority, boundaries, chores, and endless correction? Maybe you&#8217;re a homebody and never want to go anyplace else. Maybe you&#8217;re a social butterfly and would rather be everywhere else. Maybe you just are &#8220;there.&#8221; Your home is the sum of two family lines with their own unique ideals, weaknesses and strengths. Perhaps you&#8217;ve struggled to fit in and be accepted, and found your parents are hard to understand. Or maybe they have become your dearest friends. You may be the only child, or you may share your home with brothers and sisters, each with a personality of their own. Each home is different, each is unique. Your home might be your palace or your prison, your security or your trouble, but have you ever considered it as your opportunity?</p>

<p>&#8220;What opportunity?&#8221; you ask. Your opportunity to advance and step up to greater heights. Yes home&#8212;the place that lies closest to who you are and shall be&#8212;has a purpose that is so often missed. Have you ever considered that within its unique blend of relationships, responsibilities, troubles, and blessings lies the Master Teacher&#8217;s preparation class for your life? If you have submitted your life to God, your home is the training ground for future use to Him. A boot camp for His service. The school of training for the army of your King. Will you enroll?</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<h2>The Camp: How it Works</h2>
<p>Consider for a moment your home as a training camp for the army. There are the officials, whose job it is to prepare you for combat with instruction in skills, discipline, and physical training. These are under the General in Chief, who is highest in command. And, of course, there are the soldiers-in-training whose purpose is to grow in fitness and master the skills needed for service.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have never considered this view of your hum-drum home life, especially when it seems that those &#8220;officials&#8221; seem to be cracking a whip in your direction more than is needed. Most likely, as you have come to yield to that General&#8217;s plea for volunteers, you have found that the &#8220;camp&#8221; life of training has been often a trying and teary battle front of its own. Think of this then as a place to re-evaluate and look on your home in a new light.</p>

<p>Though you may certainly discover your own applications to this allegory, the following passages have been written with a desire to share what the Captain has been teaching me. May He have all the glory and honor.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<h2>Breaking In: The Basics</h2>
<p>There are some basic principles that govern each enlistee in the King&#8217;s service. Since they are the basic organization and work of the King&#8217;s army (and therefore, of our camp training) they will be considered first.</p>

<p><b>Truth</b> is our code of operation. It is set up by the General and is perfect and complete in every aspect. It remains the same, no matter what anyone says against it. On it are built all that is lasting and worthwhile. It is our standard of measurement. To receive it you must apply to the General Himself, for He says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father but by me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+14%3A6" title="John 14:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 14:6)</span></a></span>
It is His character and is shown forth to us by His word. Therefore we say that the Bible is a volume of truth, and its everlasting elements can be stood upon safely. Here are just a few of the many that it contains:</p>

<p>God cannot dwell with evil (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+5%3A4">Psalm 5:4</a>).</p>

<p>God&#8217;s love made a way for us to be saved (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+4%3A9-10">I&nbsp;John 4:9-10</a>).</p>

<p>If you draw nigh to God, He will draw nigh to you (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+4%3A8">James 4:8</a>).</p>

<p>God is faithful (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+1%3A9">I&nbsp;Corinthians 1:9</a>).</p>

<p>Nothing is impossible with God (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+1%3A37">Luke 1:37</a>).</p>

<p>God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+5%3A5">I&nbsp;Peter 5:5</a>).</p>

<p>God cares for you (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+5%3A7">I&nbsp;Peter 5:7</a>).</p>

<p>Committing sin is of the devil, and Jesus came to destroy that (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+3%3A8">I&nbsp;John 3:8</a>).</p>

<p>The Lord is good, a stronghold to trust in (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Nahum+1%3A7">Nahum 1:7</a>).</p>

<p>Without holiness no man shall see the Lord (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A14">Hebrews 12:14</a>).</p>

<p>It is of key important that we walk in truth. As the General operates, so must each trainee learn to operate. His banner is one of triumph in every circumstance, good overcoming evil. His operating basis is Love, which is the uniform worn by everyone in His service. It affects how we act and declares to everyone else our status as a soldier. Love to Him must be the supreme motivation of our service&#8212;not self-gratification and benefit. Everything done in love is worthwhile to the cause. Anything without it is totally worthless. This is because God is love, and His soldiers are called to represent Him to the world. In the same way we must uphold any truth that we are taught.</p>

<p>But truth would be of no value if the second principle, <b>faith</b>, wasn&#8217;t in operation. If we don&#8217;t have full confidence and belief in the General, we have no reason to serve Him. Faith is the door by which every volunteer has been able to enter the service. By it we operate, for
<span class="scripture">&#8220;without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder to them that diligently seek him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+11%3A6" title="Hebrews 11:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 11:6)</span></a></span>
Wherever He has placed you, and whatever trials may be yours, trust that He knows what He is doing, that His way is best. Knowing that He has won every battle should inspire our utmost confidence. We can leave the managing and directing with Him and be content to simply be a trusting child. Give first place to the cause of the kingdom, putting your hand in His,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;and all these things shall be added unto you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+6%3A33" title="Matthew 6:33"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 6:33)</span></a></span>
I have had many reminders not to go by feeling or the looks of the circumstances, but by the ability of the General. And how faithfully He has proven His promises true!</p>

<p>Thirdly, we face the need to <b>submit</b>. Ultimately, to the General, but much of this comes by practice in submitting to the &#8220;officials&#8221; He has placed over us. As a trainee in His service, it is a discipline we face daily. Though it doesn&#8217;t come naturally to yield to authority, it is none the less, necessary. The test is whether we submit quickly and cheerfully. It is His requirement that we place ourselves under authority, but He will not force us. Put the question to yourself: will I give unconditional service to my General, doing whatever He asks, by His help? Jesus is the example to follow:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+5%3A30" title="John 5:30"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 5:30)</span></a></span>
And even as a boy at home he was subject unto his earthly parents, even in the face of His great mission. The authority was set down and there was a trial of obedience, but Jesus laid down His will to do the service of a child in subjection. He learned to wait. Surely Jesus understands and can help us when the requirement seems unreasonable, the oversight too strict, and the zeal of desire strong. Jesus knew. He learned to submit in this camp of training, too.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the <b>purpose</b>, or cause, for which we are giving ourselves. We are training for an army of service: as a servant of the King, doing His will on this earth. How important a mission this is when everywhere people are blinded by the sin and darkness all around! We can&#8217;t afford to live for ourselves. We either influence others for good or evil, making the world a little better place, or a little worse. Perhaps you find yourself in less than ideal circumstances, in a home not ruled by the King, or with great personal weaknesses and limitations. But Jesus came to restore the ruins of generations. His delight is in recovering, for His power is unlimited. He still has His faithful ones, though few, and He continues to call all that will come. He wants laborers in His fields, vessels for His use. The General is calling you to a life of service: to touch others with His goodness and love.</p>

<h2>Lessons of Preparation: The Daily Drills</h2>
<p>To be useful in the King&#8217;s army we must undergo training that we may be
<span class="scripture">&#8220;prepared unto every good work.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A21" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 2:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 2:21)</span></a></span>
As any training camp, this one has a routine of exercises to strengthen you for service. But beware&#8212;they come in all sorts of ways, and often seem to be slipped secretly into your schedule. So keep your eyes open and stay on duty!</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, <b>Love</b> is the soldier&#8217;s uniform, but it has to be worn and used to be truly beneficial. It is more than a garment which we put on, for it is also an attitude of heart and a fruit to be grown in our lives. The principle trait of love&#8212;that divine love that is sometimes called &#8220;charity&#8221;&#8212;is that of giving. If we cease to give of ourselves, we cease to love. Let us exercise love in everything we do. It makes reading the storybook worthwhile, but without love even a dangerous mission trip would be a waste of time. Love is the factor by which our labor will be weighed. When it seems that your love is wearing thin, put in for a fresh supply from the General&#8217;s great store.</p>

<p>There is power in love to overcome. When anger and bitterness try to sneak into your thoughts against another, God&#8217;s love would replace them with kindness and forgiveness. Just set yourself to ask, for you are sure to receive. Often you will have to take a stand with your will before you feel loving, but the feelings follow. It is only as we see others in the same way that Christ, our Captain, does, that we can truly love them. By God&#8217;s grace, forbear when others annoy and try you. Forgive, as Christ has forgiven you. We must set ourselves to give up our wills, to lay aside our wishes, to think first of another&#8217;s good. All these things can be fulfilled by love, and you will find gain in the giving.</p>

<p><b>Humility</b>, also, is a essential trait to be exercised in our daily lives. There are two kinds: the genuine and the false &#8220;put on&#8221; kind. True humility is seeing ourselves as we are, an incompetent trainee in the service of an all-mighty King. It is the only way we can be received of Him, for
<span class="scripture">&#8220;God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+4%3A6" title="James 4:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 4:6)</span></a></span>
Its practice comes out in many areas. When reproved by a parenting &#8220;official,&#8221; in spite of how many excuses come to mind, we are called to submit humbly as good soldiers. Whether we receive praise or criticism from others there is opportunity to practice humility. In praise, to deflect it back to the Giver of the gift. In criticism or accusation, to keep from retaliation and be filled with love instead.</p>

<p>Humility shows itself by being content in whatever circumstances and line of duty we are called to. It is completely trusting the leading of our General. Submit to His will and dealings in your life; they are for your best. As a good student we shouldn&#8217;t seek to assert our own opinions and thoughts, but desire to listen and learn. The murmuring and disputing we can leave off, committing our way to Him who judges righteously. It is as we give thanks in all things that we can keep above the storm clouds in life.</p>

<p>We must also learn <b>diligence</b>. In all we do, let us strive to complete it with the highest and purest motives. Do it for God and His glory. Be not slack or weary in serving, for the General has reinforcements ready when we need them. When we think of our home service as if Jesus were there, we can give our best. Quickly obey and work for the mastery. If we set our will to do it, it can be done, but &#8220;can&#8217;t&#8221; loses before he has begun. Throw off the rocks that will bog you down, the empty and material things, but stretch out for the heights. How important to get glimpses of the reward awaiting, and to gladly flee all temptations to fleshly lusts! Follow the General. He will lead us to be a difference in this world for good, not a stumbling block. Be prepared to every good work: ready to be a &#8220;minute man&#8221; for God.</p>

<p>Let us be faithful in our service. We can see each task, each change of plans, each new trouble as an opportunity. Whatever the call, wherever the leading, let us march on and do not falter. Be true in the little or big, for the General marks by attitude, not altitude. Do not compare with others, but serve in your place whole-heartedly. As we seek to be a servant of all, we will do our best whether noticed or not. Here humility can be kept, for self will not get so much in the way. Nothing is too insignificant&#8212;the least wrong and the smallest choice for right will be noticed by Him. Live the life and keep on shining.</p>

<p>Finally, we must exercise <b>faith</b>. It is our strength, and whether we have little or much, it has to be exercised daily or we shall be unfit for service. It is trusting our General when the prospects look dim, when our efforts seem worthless, when troubles seem to pile all around. When everything else fails, still hold on, believing. It&#8217;s worth the trouble and effort to serve Him, though we may not yet see any results. Stand on the promises He&#8217;s given, looking in confidence for the answer. Lay aside the cares and burdens, handing them over into His capable hands. Look at His beauty and strength, not to yourself. Call upon Him in the day of trouble, that He may inspire and strengthen your faith. Trust and follow.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<h2>Maneuvers of Battle</h2>
<p>Spiritual service needs skilled training in other areas as well. A proven soldier is one who has fought and won. It is the battles that prove us for the King&#8217;s service. They are your tests of strength and love, and by them He would perfect His character in you. The little battles of your &#8220;home camp&#8221; prepare you for the larger and fiercer fights later on.</p>

<p>Here are some areas for progression that you may have surer success over the foe and can be of greater use in the service. Your General is your instructor, so seek His direction in all things you are uncertain in. His approval is what matters.</p>

<p>It is important that we set our <b>dependence</b> on God, and not on anything else. If we trust in our own understanding, man, or the philosophies of this world, we will be led astray. We must depend on Him for grace, it is the power to sustain us through all circumstances. We must depend on Him for strength, for our own strengths will give but false security. Depend on Him to fulfill His Word; He is faithful. Depend on Him to accomplish what is best. Seek Him to make you what you ought to be. Start each day with drawing close to Him, as a true Father. Bring to Him every need throughout the day. Go aside again when the pressures and trials overwhelm you. In Him is a security and safety found nowhere else.</p>

<p><b>Intercession</b> is coming before God on the behalf of another. Jesus is our Intercessor before God, and we are given a place in praying for those around you. There is power in prayer, and a uniting with our Captain in His purposes and love. When we come before Him with our own needs, we learn to know Him as a true and present Deliverer. When we see others in distress and need, how natural it is to turn to the Captain for help. He has all the solutions and He is never discouraged. Begin with the people you are around today. Are they enemies of His way? Ask the Captain for love to really care and see the need as He does. When we are inspired by His Spirit, we have the assurance of receiving what we ask. Maybe you have been blessed with fellow soldiers in training. How can you better support one another but by praying for each other and looking to the General to solve every difficulty that comes your way? This is where success would be found, for you are calling upon a Source that is unlimited.</p>

<p>To fight the fight we must <b>persevere</b>. We must press on and never despair. Set yourself to go through, whatever it costs you. Keep the goal in view and set your sights there. Don&#8217;t give up when the terrain is difficult, or the enemy fire hot. Hold fast and keep on the firing line. If you press through today&#8217;s battle, tomorrow&#8217;s will be that much more easier. Persevere when you&#8217;re abased or abounding. Don&#8217;t allow for slackness if life seems easy for a time, for the enemy watches out for a lazy guard. Press to go deeper and farther whether the day be dull and dragging or overwhelmingly full. Don&#8217;t be content to stay still, but desire more of God. He will get you to the goal if you will only let Him.</p>

<p>Hold out for the <b>victory</b>. Here is our triumph:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A37" title="Romans 8:37"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 8:37)</span></a></span>
You are promised victory on this side of heaven. You are called to reign in this life. You&#8217;ve enlisted in an army that always overcomes. You may suffer unfairness and injustice as a soldier, but so did your General. This is no mark of the loss of victory, for His power can cause you to triumph through every circumstance. It is part of your training to be buffeted and scorned&#8212;will you show mercy and repay evil with good? His power is available for us to cast down strongholds and through weakness to be made strong. Let us show the true colors and press on through the fight! The camp of the enemy can be our triumph. Our General is true and faithful, therefore let us follow in perfect trust. His love has conquered and will conquer still, so let us step in line and march on for the victory!</p>

<h1>Be Ye Ready&#8230;&#8203;the Garbage Truck Cometh</h1>

<h2 class="subtitle">Lessons from a New Homeowner</h2>
<p>Recently I bought a house and began to assume the responsibilities for the care and maintenance of my new home. As this was my first experience at running a property and because I wished to make as few blunders as possible, I read every bit of information sent to me regarding the procedures of the electric company, the sanitation company, the gas, phone, etc. Therefore it was not from ignorance that &#8220;disaster&#8221; (in respect to my garbage) befell me my first week as homeowner.</p>

<p>The pamphlet I received from the sanitation people stressed that I should, without fail, set out my garbage container the night before scheduled pick-up. Garbage routes in my area would start at 6:00 a.m. I marked my planner and thought no more about it&#8212;that is, until Sunday evening, after dark, when my garbage can still sat securely in my carport. It was dark, not dusk, but quite dark and <i>I</i> felt secure in my new home, and not in the least like venturing out in the dark domain. I remembered perfectly well what I had been instructed to do&#8212;but I really didn&#8217;t feel like going out, it probably wasn&#8217;t even <i>safe</i> to go outside the house, and besides, I thought, I am an early riser. Being autumn, I knew it would be still dark at 6:00, but I&#8217;m not the first house on the route, and whoever heard of a garbage truck being on time? Thus I reasoned, and after having a little argument with my more responsible side of self and my feelings, I concluded that I would rise up early and have the garbage out in plenty of time.</p>

<p>Rise up early I did, and industriously set to work vacuuming, mopping, gathering up yet more trash, and doing various activities, thinking how wise, prudent and scheduled I was. I waited for it to get light&#8212;just dawn to take out the garbage, and although it bothered me a bit that it just seemed quite &#8220;dark&#8221; outside, I set my worries aside. I had just started the dishes when I heard the sound of a truck. It was a big truck, not an ordinary one, it had big lights, and it was huge in dimension &#8220;Oh, no, the garbage truck is here!&#8221; I screeched. Rushing to the bedroom I grabbed my large overcoat, jammed it over my nightgown, and raced out the back door. I glanced at the clock as I ran. It was 6:05 a.m. By the time I had unlocked the door and dragged my poor garbage can at a furious pace down the driveway (still in the dark), the garbage truck was far down the street. I ran on, hoping that somehow the driver would see the can on his way back and have mercy on me. Over and over in my head rang the words, &#8220;It&#8217;s your own fault. You knew to set the can out. It&#8217;s your own fault. You knew to set the can out. It&#8217;s your own fault&#8230;.&#8221; And it was true. I <i>had</i> known, and I <i>had</i> chosen to believe my excuse against what was plainly the correct thing to do. Like I tell my school children, &#8220;You did it, so you suffer the consequences.&#8221;</p>

<p>How many Bibles are printed and sold in the world? How many people read God&#8217;s word or have read it at some time? How many people have read the instructions and listened to the warnings that God faithfully issues? I warrant a great deal more than we would predict. In His Word, God has promised that every person is given instructions on how to get to heaven; what to do to be ready for His coming. How many people are ready? What a vast crowd simply throws the instructions in the trash! Others skim the instructions and take out of context the meaning to suit their own plan. (&#8220;6:00 a.m.? I&#8217;m not the first person on the route! That truck won&#8217;t get here until seven.&#8221;) Still others have more of a respect for warnings and read carefully the printed word. However, they find things that conflict with their ways, and reason out the instructions. (&#8220;Set out the garbage? It&#8217;s dark&#8212;I was just going to bed! I&#8217;ll do it early.&#8221;) Whatever method is used&#8212;the result is that the warnings are disregarded, and on the Day of Judgment, many, many, many people will find they are not ready. Whatever the excuse, it will become irrelevant, when you are faced with the reality that warnings and instructions were sent, met unheeded, and disregarded, and God is ready to judge your case. We are told that in that day many people will scramble to repent and change their lives, just as I rushed the garbage can to the road in an attempt to make up for lost time. Folks, it was too late. It will be too late on the Judgment Day to repent and change. It will be a day too late, for all eternity. The time is now. Now is the day of salvation. Now you have a chance to live fully measured to God&#8217;s word. Today there are warnings being issued, instructions given, today is your opportunity to be ready when God comes. Don&#8217;t, please don&#8217;t waste the time in frivolous excuse. Yes, you may be young. Children can die. There is never time to put off salvation. Yes, it may cost you not to wear a tie on the job or suit pants in the working world. Don&#8217;t reason that it&#8217;s only temporary and you wouldn&#8217;t do it anywhere else. Have you heard the Word of God on the subject? If you have, and you know better, you will be held accountable on the Day of Judgment for your light and understanding.The devil works hard for us to count the little instructions as less important. &#8220;God doesn&#8217;t care how you dress. Go ahead and wear that necklace. Go ahead and tell that &#8216;white&#8217; lie. It won&#8217;t hurt.&#8221; Really? It can keep you from being ready when Jesus comes.</p>

<p>Recently I was shopping at Goodwill and a bright object caught my eye in the window case. It was red, blue, yellow, green, etc., and looked like &#8220;school.&#8221; Being a teacher, I leaned for a better look and discovered it was a necklace, very cute and colorful&#8212;designed to compliment an elementary teacher&#8217;s dress. Before I knew it, the devil whispered, &#8220;You could wear it just at school. It&#8217;s not really an ornament&#8212;it just states what you are, like a company logo.&#8221; The devil can give some of the lamest excuses. Imagine that I should try to justify wearing ornamentation by saying it is necessary to announce to the world that I teach school. The enemy will do anything, say anything, as long as it prevents us from following the clear instructions in the Bible. He doesn&#8217;t care how we trip up, just so we fall and be unprepared for the day of the Lord. It is so important that we keep our mind focused on the warnings and directions guiding us to be ready for the judgment. The devil will get us sidetracked with reasoning of the mind, confusion from different believers, and whatever else he can get us to listen to so we will fall short at the day of judgment. Don&#8217;t listen to him! Plug your ears and set your face toward heaven. Determine to live ready to meet God at all times, at all costs. Yes, it will cost&#8212;sometimes dearly&#8212;but it will be worth it to live prepared and ready to go. Many people in this world live with fear. Obeying God and His word to the letter will take out all fear in your heart. It will take out the apprehension in your life. It will give you a peace and security that you have not yet dreamed, to be ready, prepared to meet God.</p>
