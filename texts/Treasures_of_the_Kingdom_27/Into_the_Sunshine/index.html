<blockquote><p class="first">Adapted from <i>Choice Stories for Children</i></p>
</blockquote>


<h1>Into the Sunshine</h1>

<p>&#8220;I wish Father would come home,&#8221; the boy on the sofa said in a troubled tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father will be angry,&#8221; said Aunt Phoebe, who was sitting in the room, reading a book.</p>

<p>Richard sat up and and frowned. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be sorry, not angry. Father never gets angry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ten minutes lapsed and the sound of a bell reached his ear. &#8220;That&#8217;s Father, now!&#8221; Richard started up and went to the door. He came slowly back, saying with a disappointed air, &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t Father. I wonder what keeps him so late. Oh, I <i>wish</i> he would come!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem anxious to get into deeper trouble,&#8221; remarked Aunt Phoebe. She had been visiting for about a week and was not sympathetic toward children.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe, Aunt Phoebe, that you would <i>like</i> to see me whipped,&#8221; said Richard, indignantly; &#8220;but it won&#8217;t happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must confess,&#8221; replied his aunt, &#8220;that I think a little whipping would not be out of place. If you were my child, I am quite sure you would not escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not your child, and I do not want to be. Father is good, and he loves me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the bell rang, and again the boy left the sofa and went to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Father!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Richard!&#8221; was the kindly greeting, as Mr. Gordon took the hand of his boy. &#8220;But what is the matter, my son? You don&#8217;t look happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come in here?&#8221; Richard drew his father into the library. Mr. Gordon sat down, still holding Richard&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are in trouble, my son. What has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>Richard&#8217;s eyes filled with tears as he looked into his father&#8217;s face. He tried to answer, but his lips quivered. Then he opened the door of a glass case and brought out the fragments of a broken statue which had been sent home only the day before. A frown came over Mr. Gordon&#8217;s face as Richard set the pieces on a table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who did this, my son?&#8221; he asked in an even voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I threw my ball in the room once&#8212;only once, in forgetfulness.&#8221; The poor boy&#8217;s voice was unsteady and he looked at his father anxiously.</p>

<p>For a little while Mr. Gordon sat controlling himself and collecting his disturbed thoughts. Then he said cheerfully: &#8220;What is done, Richard, can&#8217;t be helped. Put the broken pieces away. You have had trouble enough about it, I can see. I will not add a word to increase your distress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Father!&#8221; And the boy threw his arms about his father&#8217;s neck. &#8220;You are so good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Five minutes later Richard entered the sitting room with his father. Aunt Phoebe looked up, expecting to see two shadowed faces, but she did not find them. She was puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was very unfortunate,&#8221; she said to Mr. Gordon after a little while. &#8220;It was such an exquisite work of art. It is hopelessly ruined. I think Richard was a naughty boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have settled that, Phoebe,&#8221; was the mild, but firm, answer of Mr. Gordon. &#8220;It is one of our rules in this house to <i>get into the sunshine as soon as possible.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Into the sunshine as quickly as possible! It&#8217;s the best way!</p>
