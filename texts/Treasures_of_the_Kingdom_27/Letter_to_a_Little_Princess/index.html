<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Princess,</p>

<p>Do you know what it means to prove a promise by faith? Here is a story how Princess Precious learned that &#8220;believing is the condition of receiving.&#8221; I hope you will discover this secret, too.</p>

<p>Precious was feeling tired. <i>It isn&#8217;t a very interesting day,</i> she thought as she looked out at the gray sky. She trudged down the steps to the sitting room. Prince Valiant said a cheery &#8220;Good morning!&#8221; as she plopped down into a chair. Precious mumbled a reply. It didn&#8217;t feel like a good morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;This morning it may be dreary out,&#8221; Mother Matron said, &#8220;but I have a precious note from King Jesus to read to all of you.&#8221; She smiled at them, but Precious&#8217; lips couldn&#8217;t smile back. <span class="scripture">&#8220;My God shall supply all your need&#8230;&#8203;&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+4%3A19" title="Philippians 4:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 4:19)</span></a></span> Mother Matron read. Precious&#8217; mind felt dull, but she tried to pay attention. Maybe something would come along to brighten up the day.</p>

<p>It started to drizzle during breakfast. And breakfast was plain old toast and eggs again. <i>No sunshine, nothing new to eat,</i> Precious thought. <i>How can I have a good day?</i> She thought of the King&#8217;s promise. Mother had said she should make it her very own. Could she? She would try.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, you think <i>this</i> is bad?&#8221; Valiant teased as Precious frowned at the stack of mending to do. &#8220;I have to help fix the gate. Good thing the King knows what we need, or I wouldn&#8217;t&#8230;&#8203;&#8221; His voice was muffled by the beating of hail as he opened the door. &#8220;Whoopee!&#8221;</p>

<p>Precious had to smile. If King Jesus sent hail for him, maybe He would send something to brighten up her day, too. She began to hum softly as she picked through the button tin. After she replaced the missing button on Valiant&#8217;s shirt, she picked up a mitten with a hole in the thumb. It was Valiant&#8217;s mitten. <i>Boys do tear up their clothes,</i> she thought, and glanced out the window. It was raining again and she was glad to be inside.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_27/letter_mittens.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="77" /></div>
<p>Valiant&#8217;s head poked around the door. &#8220;I&#8217;m on a polar expedition and the blizzards are hitting hard. Do you happen to know where my extra mittens are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Princess Precious said. &#8220;They have been through the repair factory and are ready for service.&#8221; Valiant thanked her and ducked outside. Precious looked at the soggy pair dropped on the floor. <i>It is a good thing God made girls. Boys do need someone to look after them,</i> she told herself as she headed for the washroom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Days like this just stack up the laundry!&#8221; Mother Matron said as she added the mittens to the full load. &#8220;The boys get their clothes so muddy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing we have a washing machine,&#8221; Precious said. &#8220;I guess the King knew we needed that.&#8221; Mother looked puzzled. &#8220;I mean, hasn&#8217;t He supplied all our needs?&#8221; Precious said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my dear, He certainly has. And it is certainly wonderful how He has supplied me with such helpful workers, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Precious&#8217; heart felt warm as she went back to the mending. It did seem that the King knew just what she needed to brighten up the day. She knew His promise was true. He had supplied all her needs.</p>

<p class="signature">With love,<br />Aunt Faith</p>
