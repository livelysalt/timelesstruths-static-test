<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t everything go like we want it to?&#8221; Alice complained. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem fair that I have to miss out because someone else is sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grandpa patted his knee. &#8220;You want life fair, my dear? Come over and I&#8217;ll tell you a story. Maybe you can tell me if fair really means what is best. It is about a man I will call &#8220;Levi&#8221;:</p>

<h1>It Wasn&#8217;t Fair</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+24%3A13-35">Luke 24:13-35</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Things had gone terribly wrong in the past week for Levi. Jesus, the Master, had been arrested and condemned to death by the rulers in Jerusalem. The trial hadn&#8217;t been one bit fair! Levi thought. Jesus had been the most faithful and true friend anyone could ever have. It was all wrong.</p>

<p>Then, three days after the crucifixion, some of the women started passing around the story that Jesus was risen from the dead. &#8220;It can&#8217;t be true,&#8221; Levi told his friend, Cleopas, as they walked home that afternoon. &#8220;What have we to hope in now? And I thought He was the Christ who would have redeemed Israel. It wasn&#8217;t right of them to condemn an innocent man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What sad topic is this?&#8221; asked a fellow traveler, stepping near.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be a stranger here to not know!&#8221; Cleopas said in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Know what?&#8221; the man asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;About Jesus of Nazereth, a prophet of God whose words and deeds are known by all the people,&#8221; Cleopas said. The stranger listened to the whole terrible story of how the Master had been betrayed and cruelly killed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of us went to the tomb to check out the rumour that the women have been telling,&#8221; Levi finished. &#8220;It was like they said&#8212;but <i>He</i> is not there.&#8221; There was a hopeless wail in Levi&#8217;s voice as he spoke of his dear Master.</p>

<p>With a light in his eyes, the stranger replied, &#8220;Fools, don&#8217;t you believe the prophets? Why <i>shouldn&#8217;t</i> Christ suffer and enter into His glory?&#8221;</p>

<p>Levi felt stunned. Didn&#8217;t this man care? But as the stranger started quoting the promises about the Christ, his doubt slowly disappeared. Could it be possible that this man was right? &#8220;He shall see travail of his soul and shall be satisfied,&#8221; the man said. It was as if the Master Himself was there again, showing them the real purposes of life. Jesus Christ <i>had come to suffer</i>&#8212;the shame and unfair treatment had all been part of the plan.</p>

<p>As they arrived in the village the man turned to go, but Levi stopped him, &#8220;Please stay with us tonight. It is getting late.&#8221; And when they sat down to supper, he felt strangely glad. Levi looked at the strong, kind face lifted in blessing, and suddenly he started up with a cry of joy. &#8220;Jesus, Master!&#8221; But it was in that moment the dear form vanished.</p>

<p>Cleopas&#8217; eyes shone. &#8220;It was He! Didn&#8217;t your heart rejoice when He was speaking to us on the way and helping us to understand the scriptures?&#8221;</p>

<p>Levi nodded and turned to the door. &#8220;We must tell the others. Surely the Christ has come and entered into His glory, just as He promised!&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Alice was quiet, thinking back to those disciples so long ago. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t they believe that Jesus would rise from the dead?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t He tell them that He was going to die?&#8221;</p>

<p>Grandpa smiled. &#8220;Yes, but it is often hard for people to believe in things they don&#8217;t understand. Like for you to believe that life can go on when your plans are changed.&#8221; He chuckled and Alice looked down. Her cheeks grew pink as she thought of how she had been grumbling.</p>

<p>Sammy had been listening from his sick bed on the couch. &#8220;I know why Jesus died,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He wanted to give us white hearts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess they didn&#8217;t know that,&#8221; Alice said slowly. &#8220;It really didn&#8217;t seem right to kill Jesus when He was so good. They didn&#8217;t understand that it was all what God had planned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it was all for good, even though they felt everything had gone wrong,&#8221; said Grandpa. &#8220;God can work all things for good to us, too. We just need to remember His plans are better than ours. Even when it doesn&#8217;t seem like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alice looked at her little brother. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for complaining. I guess you don&#8217;t want to be sick much either. I think God wants me not to be so selfish,&#8221; she said with a little smile.</p>
