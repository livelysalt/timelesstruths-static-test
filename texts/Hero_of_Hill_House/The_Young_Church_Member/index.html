<h1>The Young Church Member</h1>

<p>The congregation in the village was not supplied with a pastor all its own&#8212;Mr. Bennet also served another church. He seldom could be with the village church on prayer meeting night, so the responsibility that fell upon the class leader was increased. Also it so happened that the man who was acknowledged as class leader had fallen back in his religious life until he needed the excitement of a big meeting to stir him up to diligence. Austin already knew when he was elected as assistant that to him would fall most of the meetings, for Deacon Bond was seldom there.</p>

<p>The advice given by the pastor was of great service to Austin, and following it he sought out each week someone who was willing to read a portion of the Word and give the few comments necessary. He was proving himself a good leader for the meetings, and Pastor Bennet took a real delight in him.</p>

<p>Before many weeks the time for the quarterly meeting had once more rolled around, and the presiding elder was guest of the pastor. He had come in late on prayer meeting evening and went with Brother Bennet to the meeting. Both men had spent the day in travel and conversation and were quite weary, and they knew the congregation was not expecting them and had expected to have their meeting without the pastor&#8217;s presence. Therefore they insisted, when Austin came to them to offer them the charge of the meeting, that he go ahead as had been planned, as if no preacher were present.</p>

<p>Austin carried this word back to the old brother who had promised to read the Word that evening, but he fainted in spirit at sight of two preachers and would do nothing. So there was no way except that the young class leader should take the meeting, which he did with fair success and a rich blessing to his own soul. This little incident was always a source of much encouragement to Austin in his life as a Christian, for in it he learned that if he did his duty, God would help him through.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>It was perhaps March or April when Austin went to his uncle&#8217;s to spend a few hours. As soon as he arrived, they brought him Amy&#8217;s latest letter. It bore a special message for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Austin there?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;If he is tell him to come home. We all want him so much, and Papa says he wishes he would come,&#8221; and continuing, she told how much he was needed.</p>

<p>Austin listened while they read the letter to him, and all the family watched his face to see what he would think about it. He sat quietly a while, a great light coming into his face. This was what he had been waiting for, and praying for&#8212;word that his father wanted him to come. He knew that if he went home without such word, his father would taunt him about it, but that if he waited till his father humbled himself ever so little he would be spared that trial.</p>

<p>Schooltime for the spring was nearly over, and Austin, in the quick mental survey which he took of his affairs while the letter was being read, thought he could easily sacrifice the few remaining weeks. If he could have followed his own impulses, he would have set off that night, but that was not practical.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall go home at once, Uncle John. I have thought for a long time that I ought to go, and this letter makes me certain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad that is your decision, Austin, and while we shall miss you, your aunt and I shall feel much better satisfied about the children if you are with them. I have not liked the way Henry has been managing them. It is not a good thing for children to have too many homes,&#8221; replied Mr. Moore.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could start tonight, but I can hardly do that. I shall spend next Sunday with them, see if I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Austin with his face beaming.</p>

<p>Strong as the home cords were pulling, Austin found it hard to say farewell to his many friends where he was. Especially had his life in the village congregation been most sweet. The pastor had been encouraging him in Christian service, and deep in Austin&#8217;s heart was a desire to be of real use in the Master&#8217;s vineyard. He wondered if sometime he might not, like good Pastor Bennet, preach the gospel. His efforts in the class meetings had given him a boldness and confidence that was making him a leader among them in other ways. He had a Sunday school class, which would miss him very much. All these things Austin considered that night after he had gone to bed, and found that even his joy for going would be mixed with regret at leaving his church home.</p>

<p>After talking the whole matter over frankly with Uncle John, Austin had returned to his boarding-place in the home of Harry Coles and told Harry and his wife his new plans. They sympathized with him, for they had known something of his homesick longings, but they were sorry to lose his comradeship out of their home, for they had grown to love him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better see your school term through. You may never have another chance,&#8221; Harry suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot do it, Harry. I wouldn&#8217;t do well in school after this. I must go at once. I would start tonight if I could get ready,&#8221; said Austin, his face shining with animation.</p>

<p>His school teacher was sorry to lose her earnest, faithful pupil and told him so. Austin found himself regretting leaving her who had made his path clear through the winter&#8217;s study.</p>

<p>Saying goodbye to Pastor Bennet proved to be quite an undertaking. Austin did not realize how he had learned to love this friend, nor all that his pastor had been to him. But now, as he stood before him for the last time, his lips trembled and his heart sank. Who would give him the advice and council so needed by every young Christian? To whom should he go in times of spiritual darkness and perplexity?</p>

<p>&#8220;Austin, you will have peculiar trials in your father&#8217;s home, for you tell me he is not only unsaved, but a drinking man also. If you settle it in your heart to be a bold witness for Christ from the beginning, you will have little trouble with discouragements from him. Be bold and determined and keep your faith strong in God, and you will be able to meet the hardest trials.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Brother Bennet, Christ is needed in my father&#8217;s house. I mean to do my duty by the children, and if possible lead them to the Savior. I will neither turn back nor give up, and by God&#8217;s grace I shall be bold to speak for Him when I ought. Pray for me that I may be able to prove myself a real Christian.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another thing, Austin, seek out some spiritual people and meet with them regularly. It is far more difficult to live a Christian life without the encouragement of fellow travelers in the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I promise to do that, and to get the children into Sunday school as soon as I can,&#8221; replied the boy.</p>

<p>There was to Austin a great deal of satisfaction in the fact that he should go back to his father with good evidence of having taken care of himself. He had left home with only the clothes that he had put into one small suitcase; he was returning with two suitcases well packed. Besides this, he had money for his fare home and a goodly sum besides. That this money would go for the needs of the children he very well knew, and possibly for that reason he had been a little more lavish in buying for himself now, while he had it.</p>

<p>Besides thus providing himself with means and clothes, he had been able to get almost a full winter&#8217;s schooling. This afforded him pleasure, for he realized to some extent the handicap it is to any man to lack in learning. He would have liked to continue in school awhile longer, but to him the path of duty pointed plainly back to his charge. Now he had lost the vision of his mother to urge him on to duty, and had in her place the will of his God. He possessed a deep feeling of reverence and love for God, and went back to his place of responsibility resolved not to let the influence of unholy surroundings hinder him in the service of his Savior.</p>

<p>The evening came that he was to start for home. Time had slipped by quickly, for he had been careful not to give himself more time than was actually necessary for his preparations. He stood again at the same little station with Aunt Tillie and Uncle John. Less than two years had passed since he, with the children, had stood there before waiting for the train, but it seemed to him he had lived many times that long. Then he had gone with a child&#8217;s trust into the unknown future, now he knew to some extent what the trials were before him. Then he had only the vision of his mother as a star to lead him on, now he had the blessed Son of God as his Example and Pattern.</p>
