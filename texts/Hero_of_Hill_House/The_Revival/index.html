<h1>The Revival</h1>

<p>Only those who have lived in a rural community can realize the place in the social life of the people the revival holds. In the city and larger town the movies and theaters with other places of amusement and social activities fill up the time, but here the occasional picnic, party, or dance is the only form of social diversion, and the younger people become starved for somewhere to go and something to do. And the older people, while they enjoy the spiritual enlivenment of the revival, also come under the power of social enjoyment and give themselves over to a season of communion together.</p>

<p>The little village near Harry Coles&#8217; place was the social center of the farming region round about, and the little church was the center of the village life. Joseph Bennet, pastor of the congregation, was a spiritually-minded man who had the interests of the people at heart. His life had been clean and sincere, and everyone had confidence in him, so when he planned to begin a revival early in the winter, the entire community was ready to lend him assistance with their interest and presence. From the first this meeting gave promise of more than ordinary success. It was not a big meeting because of the work of some talented and eloquent evangelist, but was the joint effort of pastor and people striving under God&#8217;s hand to be a blessing to their community. The preaching was simple but plain and earnest and carried conviction to the hearts of the hearers.</p>

<p>Pastor Bennet was a wise man in many ways, and to enlist the interest and cooperation of the younger folk he formed a choir wholly of young people and gave them a place in the front of the building. This gave them a feeling of responsibility and overcame to a great extent the possibility of inattention or irreverence on their part. He thought it gave him a better chance of winning them for Christ, and that was his special aim in the meetings, the winning of souls for Christ.</p>

<p>Austin was interested in the meeting from the first, and was a regular attendant. And when he was invited to join the choir, he accepted, though he confessed himself a poor singer. Pastor Bennet was interested in this quiet boy and spoke to him at different times about giving his heart to God. Also Austin&#8217;s Sunday school teacher, who was organist, was particularly interested in Austin and often spoke to him of his soul&#8217;s need. His place in the choir put him near her, and he was often conscious of her prayers for him.</p>

<p>Though Austin had always been an obedient boy and was extremely conscientious in all he did, he had never given his heart to Christ. He had always been conscious of the will and desire of his mother and had sought to walk pleasing to her, rather than to acknowledge an allegiance to God. But in the perplexities of the past year since his mother had been away he had often blindly called out to God for help and had felt that God did help and strengthen him. Yet now, as he sat under the preaching of God&#8217;s word, he became conscious of a longing in his soul that only a life with God could satisfy. He desired with all his heart to be a Christian.</p>

<p>But the same obstacles stood in his way that hinder the spiritual progress of other boys. He was timid, extremely so, and the thought of going forward and kneeling with the other seekers at the altar of prayer frightened him. And he feared he could not hold out if he did start, which would be worse than not starting at all. There was the possibility of ridicule and mockery that he might receive at the hands of others, which, made the way look fearful. So, halting between two opinions, he waited from night to night before he at last made his decision.</p>

<p>The meeting was the one great subject of conversation in the home where he lived. Though none of the family were professors, all of them were in sympathy with the meeting, all respected the pastor and wished him success, and all honestly believed that it was better for any person to &#8220;make a start,&#8221; as they expressed it. They were all genuinely pleased when Nell Purdy&#8217;s brother and John Finley&#8217;s son, Sam, forsook their wild ways and &#8220;joined church.&#8221; And they watched closely to see who else of their neighbors and friends seemed to be most interested and might, before the meeting closed, &#8220;make a start.&#8221; If one of them had to remain away, he was always eager to inquire of the others how the meeting was and who &#8220;went forward.&#8221; And the Coles home was a sample of all the homes in the neighborhood. There was no doubt but that the meeting was getting hold of the people in a way to bring lasting good.</p>

<p>One night Austin stood singing with the others the touching invitation hymn, when he noticed that Theo Kelsey, who stood next to him, was trembling violently. Austin&#8217;s own heart beat faster as he saw Theo thinking seriously of his soul&#8217;s salvation. The organist, looking up, saw the concern and interest written on each boyish face and silently prayed as she played. Another worker saw, too, and came and talked to the boys, but both shook their heads at her invitation; however, when she had left, Theo said in a whisper to Austin, &#8220;I will go if you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Austin, hardly thinking Theo would have the courage to walk out past the others to the place of prayer. But Theo was in earnest and, hesitating but a moment, he walked past Austin and the others to the altar. Austin was a boy to keep his promise; it had been only timidity that had kept him away from the place of prayer for several nights, and so he, too, stepped forward, just behind Theo.</p>

<p>He bowed himself at the end of the altar, almost at his Sunday school teacher&#8217;s feet, and she left her post at the organ at once and knelt beside him. At first he was bewildered and could hardly breathe for the wild beating of his heart, but in a little while he remembered why he was there and the promises of God to those who come to Him. His teacher was by his side to instruct and teach him, and in only a short time he felt in his heart that God had forgiven him for his past sins, and that he was His child. A sweet sensation of peace and quiet filled his heart, and he rose from his knees a new creature. Some who had been converted had shouted aloud the praises of God, but he did not feel like doing that. When the pastor spoke to him a little later and asked him if he had received that which he sought, he smiled and said he thought he had.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then be ready to tell to others what God has done for you,&#8221; said Pastor Bennet as he passed on to speak to another.</p>

<p>Before the services closed opportunity was given for those who had found the Lord to testify of his love, and Austin, true to his natural principles of honesty and sincerity, rose and, in very trembling tones, told that he believed Jesus saved him.</p>

<p>Austin had been the only member of the Coles household to go to church that night, and the next morning he said nothing to the family about what had happened to him, but went on about his chores as usual. When Harry, while they were busy milking, asked him who had gone forward, Austin spoke of two or three whom he had seen go before he went, but said nothing about himself. He was not ashamed, but he was yet very timid. That night Harry soon saw that Austin was among the converts. He chided him a little when they reached home again for not telling him about it, but added kindly, &#8220;Stay with it, Austin. It is the best thing any man can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The meeting soon closed, but Pastor Bennet, being a wise man, as we have said, set to work finding something for the young converts to do. He did not find them all ready to begin active service, but in Austin Hill he found a young Christian who, though timid, was ready to do all he could for God&#8217;s glory. The pastor instructed him to use every opportunity for prayer and testimony, and Austin, following this advice, was soon bold to move forward when the others were yet standing back timidly. His prayers and testimonies he knew to be often poorly worded, and at times he was tempted with the thought that they did no one any good, but he remembered that they were doing him good and exercised himself accordingly.</p>

<p>At the first business meeting of the church after the new members were taken in, Austin was elected as assistant class leader. He did not refuse the place, but went to his pastor puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am young, only a boy, and many in the congregation are old men. How could I lead a meeting? It is all I can do to testify, and I am afraid I will make poor success.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you are young, Austin, but you are earnest, and the Lord will help you. All that is necessary on your part anyway is to be here and see that the meeting starts on time, and read a portion of Scripture, possibly with a few comments. You need not feel you must preach a sermon. And, for a little hint&#8212;the best leader is the one who can get others to do something,&#8221; said his pastor in reply.</p>
