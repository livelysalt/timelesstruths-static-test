<h1>Humiliation for Austin</h1>

<p>His experience in the gardens of Mr. Long had a direct effect upon both Austin and his father. To Austin, whose manly feelings were early awakening, there was an untold sweetness in handling his own money. He found a keen pleasure in this that gave him a thirst for money-making, which was certain to assert itself at the first opportunity. No longer could he be satisfied in the house doing merely housework. He wanted to be a breadwinner also. He felt proud not to depend entirely upon his father.</p>

<p>His father was as enthusiastic as Austin at the anticipation of his making money, but the father&#8217;s enthusiasm lay in the fact that so long as Austin was making money it would take less from him for the support of the family. To one who longed to spend upon himself and his accursed drink all that he could obtain, the supplying of a family of seven with food and clothes was no small burden. Henry Hill was not a common workman, but was capable of making good money, and had been favored with an opening which brought in plenty for the needs of his family. It was not necessary that they be in cramped circumstances. But when the support of his family had been taken from his wages, it left but a small margin for his personal pleasure, and he hated sacrifice. While Austin could not make a man&#8217;s wages, what he did earn helped remarkably in the family expenses.</p>

<p>The satisfaction of Austin and his father was mutual&#8212;though prompted by very different motives&#8212;when Austin obtained a position in one of the village stores. At this time he was just past fourteen, stood nearly six feet tall, and was well proportioned for his height. Many men were no taller nor heavier than he, though he lacked the strength of a full-grown man.</p>

<p>Amy and Nell were little misses of twelve and ten, pretty, dainty girls, full of life and activity. Their mother had begun their education in housework, and they had helped Austin since he had been taking the lead. They knew how to do all the simple household duties needful for their humble home. They could also cook simple meals quite well, and so far as knowledge of proceedings was concerned were able to keep up the housework. Austin was at home in the morning and evening and oversaw their work, helping with the heavier part. Working thus together they got along very well. But you must not suppose that these children were able to keep their home as an older person would have done. Always there was lacking the mother-touch.</p>

<p>When Austin saw how well the girls did, he felt satisfied to go to the store each morning, and his wages were sufficient to supply the family with plenty of good, wholesome food. His father was glad to have him do this, and withheld his own money, allowing Austin to assume the responsibility. Seeing that all was going so well, he would be away days at a time, and always when he returned everything was prospering.</p>

<p>Mr. Hill was apparently contented for a short while, but soon he had another attack of wanderlust, and, giving up his good position, he went into an adjoining state where an oil-boom was on and much work was to be had. He left the family as before in Austin&#8217;s care, and also this time failed to provide means for their support while he was gone. He was sure Austin would find a way to keep things going. Austin was thankful for his work and that he could keep the home up, and stayed steadily at his place every day.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>&#8220;Does Austin Hill work here?&#8221; a gentleman asked the store owner one afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He is in the back of the store now. I will call him. Austin.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy answered, coming in immediately.</p>

<p>Taking him to one side, the man looked him over sharply and said, &#8220;I am a welfare officer and have received complaints about your family. I am told that your father is away and that the children are not being properly supported, in fact that they lack the food they should have. Is this a fact?&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Austin! he stood in amazement, his face growing red and white by turns. He had been priding himself that he could do a man&#8217;s part by the children, and had been elated at his success, and here the people thought he was starving them! When he could find words, he answered, &#8220;It is not true, I assure you. My father is away, but he has not been gone long, and in that time we have had plenty. At this time the house is well stocked with food, as you will find if you search it. Go see for yourself that this report is not true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I do not want to do that. I only want to know that the children are having plenty,&#8221; the man replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I want you to go. I want you to know that it is not true. If you do not wish to go alone, take my aunt with you. She lives nearby,&#8221; Austin urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Austin, for your sake I will investigate. I am sorry I have wounded you so much, but I had to do something about it,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>An hour later the officer was again in the store to see Austin. &#8220;I found the reports to be utterly false,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If every family in town were as well supplied as yours, some people would live better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet Austin&#8217;s heart felt sick, and he was almost too ashamed to lift his head as he started for home. He felt disgraced and humiliated in the eyes of his neighbors. That it had been one of them who had uttered the complaint he was certain, but which one could be so base and false he could not guess. Never before had he had occasion to think he had enemies. Till now everyone had seemed to be full of faith in him. What had he done to break their confidence? Not once did it occur to him that even if the reports had been true, he would not have been to blame. No one was accusing him of not doing his duty. It was evident that he was doing all he could. Nor did he stop to consider that to the minds of the people it was inconsistent that he, a boy of fourteen, should be supporting a family of six. He took the whole insult upon himself, writhing under the humiliation. He was half tempted to give up trying to care for the children. It looked as if failure was all he could expect.</p>

<p>But determined persistence was one of Austin&#8217;s strong points, and he set to work to investigate the origin of these reports, and when he found their source, a new difficulty was presented and a real cause for concern made bare. Austin was gone all day long, being at home but a few moments at noon. The children, when not in school, found the house lonely and dull. They had no one to direct their efforts nor to control their impulses, so they came and went as they pleased. Austin had not thought of this difficulty, for till now they had lived in the country.</p>

<p>One of their neighbors had children about the age of the Hill children, and the two families played together much of the time. Amy and Nell, as well as the younger children, had formed the habit of wandering about among the neighbors, being at home very little. They were especially often found in the kitchen of this near neighbor, and, as one can easily see, the cooking of this woman would taste better to them than what they prepared at home themselves, and they were always glad for anything to eat they could get. This woman noticed the tendency of the children to seize upon any bit of food offered them, and formed her own conclusions. She was a woman who liked excitement, especially the kind caused by gossip, and, going about among the neighbors, she had circulated the reports which finally reached the officer with the result we have just heard.</p>

<p>But the contradictory reports of the officer put things in a different light, which angered her considerably. Why, we cannot say, but she and her family vented their chief anger upon Austin. He it was who had discomfited them, and was therefore to blame.</p>

<p>Austin did not spare his reproofs to the children nor his commands as to their behavior in the future. He blamed them for running about as they had. Because he was so little older than the girls, he could not see why they should not feel some of the responsibility that loaded him. He could not sympathize with their carefree and thoughtless ways, and reproved them accordingly. He was indeed finding that the cares of a family man are many.</p>

<p>One evening as he and his family were eating supper, the thick, incoherent voice of a drunken man fell on their ears. Turning to the door, they saw him coming up the walk staggering. Austin stepped to the screen and latched it, not wishing him to come in among the children in that condition. The fellow was in a terrible anger, and, reeling up to the door, he said, &#8220;I want you, Austin Hill, to come out here. I am going to whip you for the lies you have been telling on us.&#8221; Austin recognized him as one of the men from the home of the neighbor who had circulated the evil reports.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not want to fight you. You are in no condition to fight, and I have done nothing to deserve a whipping,&#8221; said Austin quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You come out here, you coward, and I will show you how you can put the lie on us as you have. Come out and let us settle this like men,&#8221; commanded the fellow with horrid oaths.</p>

<p>Seeing he was crazy with drink, Austin said no more; making the door safe, he went away and left him alone. The man after a while went back home, and no more was said about it. But this incident depressed Austin all the more. His problem seemed too hard for him to solve. That night his pillow was wet with tears, and he longed for his mother to advise him. Though surrounded by his father&#8217;s people, he had little help or encouragement from them, for they feared that Henry would depart and leave them the entire responsibility of the children if they assumed any care of them now. They had all confidence in Austin, but very little in the stability of his father.</p>

<p>His aunts were quick to see the mistakes Austin made in the management of the children&#8212;and he made many mistakes, for he was too young to have the wisdom to manage such a large family.</p>

<p>No wonder the boy was discouraged and depressed. But one vision strengthened him. Again he thought he saw his mother and that she smiled on him and bade him stand by the children. He took courage and the next morning was ready to face life again. Austin loved the children more and more, and as the responsibilities deepened upon him, he cried out in his heart, &#8220;God help me.&#8221; And the Lord heard that prayer.</p>
