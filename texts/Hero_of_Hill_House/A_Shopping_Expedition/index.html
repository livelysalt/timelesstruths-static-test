<h1>A Shopping Expedition</h1>

<p>A year had passed since Austin had begun work in Weston and the three of them had set up housekeeping, and he was to have his first vacation. There had been many changes since that year began, mostly for the better. The cottage was now quite comfortably and prettily furnished throughout. To accomplish this had meant much hard work and little recreation for both Austin and Nell. Amy had never entered into the homemaking with the ardor of her younger sister, and much of the time of late had been away. Lila and Doyle had now been with them a number of months, and had thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated home comforts and pleasures. Nell had been Austin&#8217;s comfort and delight all these months. Harry had not yet come to them. He had the same traits of self-reliance and determination that had characterized Austin, and had found himself, though so young, plenty able to support himself, and he preferred to do it rather than to depend upon Austin. But only too well Austin knew the small chance his little brother would have for education in this way, and he longed to have him at home and in school while he was of school age. But recently had come a letter from the little fellow saying that he thought he would soon come to them, which message had sent a thrill of delight around the little circle. They longed to have it complete.</p>

<p>In planning his vacation, Austin had in his thoughts turned to the associations that had been so very pleasant in those months he had been permitted to spend in school. Here also was a man who had been more than a mere friend to him, and who would be able, he believed, to give him the counsel and advice he felt he needed just now with the care of his family. A visit in the home of this friend would indeed be enjoyable, and he might also meet with some others who had made those months bright. And what was perhaps a greater factor in his choice at this time was that the distance was not so great but what he could take with him his sister Nell. She needed the rest and change as much as he. He turned the plan over in his mind for some time, and when he thought he could see his way clear for such an undertaking, he mentioned his scheme to Nell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Austin, I should be delighted to go, but I should need new clothes for such a trip, and are you certain we can afford them!&#8221; exclaimed his little housekeeper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have thought of all that, Nell, and I am sure we can manage,&#8221; replied Austin happily.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Austin, just my clothes is not all the problem. The children are going to need many new things this winter. Lila has outgrown or worn out nearly all her clothes, and Doyle is almost as badly in need. And I need a number of new things about the house. But perhaps we could get them cheaper while we are there in the city,&#8221; said the thoughtful little girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had been thinking some about that; but I do not see how I can spare scarcely a thing for them now. We can, perhaps, get them a little at a time here as we must have them, but just at present I cannot raise the amount it would take,&#8221; answered Austin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Austin,&#8221; said Nell one day, &#8220;maybe Papa would give us enough for me to do that shopping. He has not helped us a bit and he has had work all the time. Let us count up just what we might need, and, when he comes next week, let us ask him for the money. It is only right that he should help you with the care of the children, and I want to get the things right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you make a list of all the things you want to get and we will calculate the cost of them, and I will see what I can do with Papa. He promised to help us, and perhaps he will do so now,&#8221; said the boy patiently. He hated to ask his father for the money, but he hated worse to see his sister deprived of this pleasure.</p>

<p>When the bill was made and culled to what they thought would not be inconsistent to expect of their father, fifty dollars was the amount they were going to ask of him. The thought of this sum in hand for shopping purposes made the heart of the little girl buoyant, and she set about preparing for her journey with a very happy heart. It is certainly strange the music the contemplating of new clothes puts into the heart of a girl!</p>

<p>Mr. Hill came at the time expected, and was in the best of humor and seemed delighted to find his children doing so well. Nell took advantage of his good grace to explain about her trip to the city and the things she wanted to get. She showed him what was needed in the house to add to its comfort and beauty, and enlarged upon the scantiness of wardrobe for Lila and Doyle. And apparently he fell into her net without a misgiving.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be fine, Nellie, and I will see that you have plenty of money to get what you need. I hardly suppose that Austin can afford to get all those things at once. It is fortunate that I came home just at this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Papa. We shall appreciate it much if you will help, for Austin has had so much expense in getting everything started that he cannot let me have much just now. I think it will be just grand to buy them in the city.&#8221; Nell&#8217;s eyes shone with happiness as she spoke, and her hopes rose even higher so that she dared to hope for some of the pretty things her beauty-loving heart desired. She hurried about getting the house in shape and her wardrobe ready with as high hopes as ever a girl had. But the days passed one by one and her father did not give her the money. She began to have misgivings, and went to Austin about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Austin, why does he not give me the money! Do you suppose he means to go back on his word? Has he said anything to you about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not mentioned the matter to him. He promised you so fairly that I thought best not to say anything. He will surely give it to you pretty soon,&#8221; said Austin comfortingly, though with many doubts in his own mind as to his father&#8217;s intentions.</p>

<p>The morning of the last day before they were to start came and yet not one penny had been given them, nor did their father make any more mention of the matter. Austin promised Nell he would talk to him about it that evening, thus giving him all the time possible.</p>

<p>When Austin came home that evening it was to face the angriest girl he had ever seen. She was fairly bursting with indignation. Her black eyes snapped and her face was red with suppressed emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Austin, Austin, what do you think! Oh, it is too awful that he would be so mean! Papa gave me a little, old, ten-dollar bill! Think of it, after all my plans, and he knows how much I need. I told him at the first it would take all of fifty to get the things we really need. And he gave this as though he was doing me a great favor,&#8221; and the girl, unable longer to suppress her emotions, burst into a torrent of sobs, and tears.</p>

<p>Austin stood without saying a word, looking at her. He felt stunned. Though he had long ago lost faith in his father, yet he had not thought he would be so contemptible as this showed him to be. His pity as well as his love for the child before him was unbounded, and he sought with all the tender words he could think of to comfort her. He promised to add a little to the ten so that she might get a few of the things she had hoped for, but he knew it was not much that he could do.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Austin, I might as well give up the trip. With the little dab I would have I could do nothing. Oh, I wanted to throw it in his face!&#8221; and a fresh burst of sobs drowned her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nell, you will not disappoint me like that. I have counted so much on your company. Please say that you will go anyway, and I will go to Papa and see if I can get him to do better,&#8221; pleaded Austin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, but he will not do any more. I know he will not,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>With a hasty look upward to the One who can give grace to calm the turbulent soul, Austin went to confer with his father. He set the matter before him in all its pathos.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nell has worked hard, and been such a faithful housekeeper. She is not wanting to buy extravagantly, and she ought to have all that she has asked. I can&#8217;t do any more, and I can hardly bear to see her so disappointed. Can you not do better by her now?&#8221; he had pleaded, humbling his own spirit in the asking, for he would rather have gone bungry and cold than to have asked his father for a cent. But his plea only succeeded in making his parent angry.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are both as ungrateful as you can be. The idea of a girl not being satisfied with ten dollars to go off on a shopping tour. She needs to come down a bit. And if this is the way you appreciate what I do for you, I shall pull out of here and leave you to yourselves. Do not think I shall give another penny for any such a purpose.&#8221; And, suiting his action to his word, Henry Hill began making himself ready for his departure from the roof of his ungrateful children.</p>

<p>Austin went back to Nell to tell her that he had been successful only in making his father angry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him be angry, and let him go. I do not care,&#8221; she said spitefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nellie, let us make the best of it and go on our trip,&#8221; coaxed Austin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do it for your sake, but all the fun of it is spoiled for me,&#8221; said Nell with a sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe not, sister. I believe you will enjoy yourself well with my friends there, and we shall have enough money to take us sightseeing all over the city. I will give you the very best time I can, and we shall do our shopping as we have opportunity during the winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Nell was comforted and made willing to go with her brother. The trip was, after all, a very pleasant one. She met a number of his friends, and found herself very happy in the home of their host. Too, it was pleasant to have cooking and housework off her mind for a week, and to go about with Austin looking at the pretty things she could not buy, and enjoying the beautiful parks and drives of the city. The expedition was far from a failure to her, though of course her shopping excursion was spoiled.</p>

<p>Schooldays were at hand again, and it was with much satisfaction that Austin saw the children back in school. Harry had kept his promise and was now with them. He was a lad of thirteen, unusually tall and well-developed for his age. There was much in his bearing and manner to remind one of Austin, and he possessed a kindred spirit to that of his brother. But in his knocking about working when and where he could and &#8220;taking care of himself,&#8221; as he called it, he had been sadly missing his chance for education. That he was now with them and busy in the schoolroom gave much pleasure to Austin, who could appreciate the need the boy would later find of learning.</p>
