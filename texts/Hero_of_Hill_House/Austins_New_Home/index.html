<h1>Austin&#8217;s New Home</h1>

<p>&#8220;How is life serving you these days, Austin?&#8221; asked his companion quietly, for the expression of the young man&#8217;s face showed that he was facing some perplexity. He had sought opportunity for a confidential talk with an older friend whom he knew was interested in all his affairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems my life is a long series of crises, and I face one now that is exceedingly perplexing. I should like to lay the matter before you and obtain your opinion as to what I should do. I have come to where my path seems to break and I do not know which way to go, yet God knows my heart, that I want only His will done in me. You have heard, possibly, that Nell has deserted me? I do not blame her, poor girl, for her part has not been an easy one. Then, too, the way I allowed her to be overburdened when we had Uncle&#8217;s children has been against her. Though she was as willing as I was to help him out, the overwork was too much for her nerves, and she has suffered from it. Besides that, she seems to be filled with the same restlessness that attacked Amy. I shall just have to let her face her own problems her own way, I suppose,&#8221; and a sigh slipped from his lips. Where is the parent of grown children who has not sighed the same way?</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, Austin, that you have expected both Amy and Nell to be like your self in steadiness and singleness of purpose, when you have not really had any youth. Possibly the very fact that you had to fight off every youthful inclination and be a mature man before your time, for the sake of your family, has placed you where you cannot sympathize with their fickleness. Really, Austin, they are girls, just girls. You cannot judge their actions by the standard with which you judge your own, for your viewpoints are vastly different,&#8221; reasoned his friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I have expected them to fill the places of full-grown women. I am certain much of our trouble has been right there. Another thing I am thoroughly convinced of is that girls need the guidance of an older woman. Both Amy and Nell have worked out problems in their own way and come to conclusions that would never have been reached had they been guided by an older and wiser person,&#8221; said Austin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you are right. A child can be cared for by nurses and teachers, but when a girl reaches her teen age she needs a mother, or someone who can take the place of a mother,&#8221; agreed his friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you come to my point of perplexity. I think that in failing to recognize this fact I have failed to quite an extent with Amy and Nell. I can excuse myself because they were so little younger than I, and were spoiled for lack of control when I took them. But with Lila it is different. I have had her a great portion of her life, and I feel a responsibility that I never did with the others. But she is just now where she needs mother-care the most. Already I begin to see signs of the same restlessness and wilfulness that has spoiled the other girls. She is such a sweet child, and I want her to make good. But what am I to do? Can you give me any counsel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you and Lila expect to keep house the same as ever?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ought we? She wants us to, and is distressed if I mention any other arrangement. So far as the work is concerned, with my help she could get along very well. But she would be alone too much for one so young; and besides, she is not developing along the lines I wish to see her develop. She is very enthusiastic just now over the idea of being my housekeeper, and thinks it would be the best of fun. But she will in time become tired of the responsibility, and I shall have the same old trial over again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you not secure a competent housekeeper who would be able to take the oversight of the girl as well, and thus save the day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I might, if such a person could be found. But it is a difficult matter to find a person capable of coming into a home and taking the reins in the manner you suggest. Such women already have their places. Lila would not be easily managed, especially if she should be approached in the wrong manner. She has a peculiar temperament, but is tractable enough if one understands her. She would likely resent any interference from one whom she would consider an outsider. I have no idea where I could find a person who would answer the need.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That plan would depend entirely upon the disposition of the person employed. It would indeed be hard to find one who would take a motherly interest in the girl. Have you any other plans?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. If I could find a home for Lila where she would be made welcome and given kind, thoughtful mother-care, I should be glad to put her in it. I should of course support her and pay well for her care. What do you think of that plan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what would you do, Austin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I should have to close the house and board somewhere. Batching would not appeal to me after having the family. I believe I should die of loneliness. Even with Lila it is very trying for me at times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be unfair to you. You are a home-lover. For a home you have given all your young years, and now to be thrown out with no roof of your own would be harder for you than you now imagine. Besides, breaking the home now would be such a financial sacrifice. In a few years you will wish to begin your home again from a different angle and motive; for you will find you are not different from other men. It seems such a loss and waste. I wish your home could be preserved,&#8221; said his friend with marked earnestness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have thought of all those things. So I am waiting to see what I ought to do. I hate to give up my home, and I confess it looks dreary ahead of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the conversation was interrupted and never taken up again. Austin returned to his cottage home to consider further his problem.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lila, would you like to have me find you a good home somewhere with a woman who could give you more care than I am able to? You must get lonely here, when I am away so many hours each day; and I cannot feel restful about you. Do you not think the other plan would be better?&#8221; Austin questioned of his sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Austin, I do not want you to do that. You are the only one I want to be with, and this home is good enough for me,&#8221; she said decidedly.</p>

<p>Again that sigh. What should he do? What was best? And all those dreams and aspirations of a life of usefulness for God! Where were they and what were they? Only imaginations? Or had he received a call from God? A few more years at longest, and he should be free of his family responsibilities, and then where should he turn? Questions, one after another, forced themselves upon him; but he was powerless to answer.</p>

<p>Another plan, sweeter and better than all the rest stood ever before him; but he could not be certain it would be for the best. This plan would not only bridge over the present perplexity, but it would change his whole life. What if it should end in disappointment! But the plan was ever before him. Why should he look for an elderly lady for his housekeeper? There was Bessie Allison! With Bessie&#8217;s strong heart and capable hand the tangles of his home-life would unravel, and all would go well. Besides, there was Bessie herself.</p>

<p>Austin was no longer a boy, and his heart yearned for something in his home-life which his younger brothers and sisters could not give him.</p>

<p>If Bessie was willing&#8212;and he learned that she was&#8212;his home would be preserved in the happiest way possible. Besides, Bessie&#8217;s interests and energies were turned toward that life of usefulness for which he craved. They would be one in their service to God.</p>

<p>When he had considered all this, and had learned that his plans and hopes found a hearty echo in the true heart of Bessie, the clouds that had been hanging so low were all cleared away, and life looked bright and rosy again.</p>

<p>To these arrangements Lila gave a glad approval, and welcomed her new sister warmly. Nell was glad also for the change in Austin&#8217;s affairs, for though she could not bring herself to be willing to take up the burden of housekeeping, yet her conscience kept her continually unhappy at the thought of his perplexity and trial. This was a happy way out for all. Harry and Amy and Doyle all rejoiced with them that the home had been preserved.</p>

<p>Thus, with the clouds rolled away and the sunshine of love and hope smiling upon them, Bessie and Austin began their life together.</p>
