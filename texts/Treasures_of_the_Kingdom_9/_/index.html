<h1>When Rosie Couldn&#8217;t</h1>

<p>It was a bad day for Rosie. She had woken up with a scratchy throat and an ache in her head, but that wasn&#8217;t the worst part. Mom had said that if everyone was well enough the family would go for a hike up Bayberry Hill and have a pic`nic for supper. But now she couldn&#8217;t go because she was sick. Rosie dragged her feet slowly when Dad called for family devotions, and she only mumbled her prayer.</p>

<p>At breakfast Rosie just pushed her food around. &#8220;My throat hurts,&#8221; she complained, and left her blueberry muffin half eaten.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please bring your dishes to the sink,&#8221; Mom said. &#8220;And, Rosie, dear, you will feel much better if you just try to be cheerful.&#8221; Rosie tried to lift the corners of her mouth, but she didn&#8217;t feel happy. <i>I can&#8217;t smile anymore,</i> she thought sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Girls,&#8221; Mom said, &#8220;while Dad is working outside with the boys, I thought we could clean up the house and do some baking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Irene, could you have Emma help you with the front room? Kyle and Rosie can work with me.&#8221; Rosie almost smiled to think of two-year-old Kyle working, but then she remembered her headache.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_9/rosie_dusting.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="343" /></div>
<p>&#8220;My head doesn&#8217;t feel very well, Mama. I can&#8217;t work,&#8221; she said as she followed Mother down the hall.</p>

<p>Mother didn&#8217;t say anything, but poked her head into each of the bedrooms and opened the closet. &#8220;Here is a dust rag and a broom for the cobwebs. I will take care of vacuuming. When you&#8217;re done, Rosie, you can take Kyle outside for awhile.&#8221; Rosie was about to say that she couldn&#8217;t do that either, but she thought better of it.</p>

<p>Slowly Rosie pulled a rag over a dresser top; it caught around a stack of books. &#8220;I can&#8217;t dust when everything is in the way,&#8221; she said fretfully to herself. &#8220;And the bookshelf is too high for me.&#8221; When Mom came by the door, Rosie quickly began brushing off the bedpost. The lampshade was next, and then the toy box was given a few swipes with the rag. After the ceiling corners were poked with the broom, Rosie looked around. Down inside she knew that she hadn&#8217;t done her best, but she excused herself. &#8220;I&#8217;m not very big, so I couldn&#8217;t do it very well,&#8221; she said, and went on to the other rooms.</p>

<p>An hour later Rosie plopped down on the couch, blinking back a few tears. <i>How can I help it if everything is too hard and I don&#8217;t feel well.</i> Mom had just had to scold her for being careless and not listening. And it was the tears that made her throat start hurting again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring your socks over here, Rosie,&#8221; Mom called from the sewing corner. &#8220;Now is a good time for me to teach you how to mend them.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_9/rosie_darning.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="355" /></div>
<p>Rosie sat on a little stool with Mom&#8217;s wooden darning egg in the toe of her stocking and watched Mom weave the thread in and out around the hole. &#8220;Be careful to make small stitches&#8212;just go under, over, under, over, like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosie held the needle and looked at the smooth row Mom had stitched. It looked too hard and she didn&#8217;t feel like sewing. &#8220;I can&#8217;t do it,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rosie dear, I think you can if you will try,&#8221; Mom said patiently. &#8220;Just go up and down around that hole.&#8221; So Rosie did, but she went a bit too fast. Ouch! A little prick in her finger began bleeding, and she quickly dropped the darning into her lap.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do it; it&#8217;s too hard.&#8221; She pressed the sore finger to her lips. Mom didn&#8217;t say anything. &#8220;Now my finger hurts,&#8221; Rosie murmured, with a little sniff.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry it does,&#8221; Mom said without looking up from her mending, &#8220;but it doesn&#8217;t have to. I&#8217;ve sent Emma out to get the last red tomatoes, and if you&#8217;d rather help outside I think Dad will have something for you to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosie didn&#8217;t want to help outside. She walked slowly to the piano and began tapping on the keys. &#8220;Rosie?&#8221; It was Irene from the kitchen. &#8220;If you&#8217;re practicing your lesson, at least play the right notes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m <i>trying</i>,&#8221; Rosie said, blinking back the tears. <i>I can&#8217;t do anything right,</i> she thought as she stared at the black notes in her piano book.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the problem?&#8221; asked Dad, as he sat down in his big chair to take off his boots. &#8220;Is my little Rosy-posy having trouble with her lesson?&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_9/rosie_music.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="111" /></div>
<p>Slipping off the piano bench, Rosie hurried to climb onto his lap. Dad&#8217;s shoulder felt strong and loving under her cheek; she brushed away her tears and began to tell him about it. At first she told about the hard music and her pricked finger and how she didn&#8217;t like mending socks. &#8220;Oh, I see,&#8221; said Daddy, and listened some more. She remembered her sore throat, how she couldn&#8217;t do anything, especially going on the picnic, and how terrible it all was.</p>

<p>When she was quiet, Daddy said, &#8220;So you just couldn&#8217;t do anything today? Only feel grumpy and sad? Well, that is terrible.&#8221; His voice was quiet when he asked, &#8220;Is that how you want your day to be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Daddy,&#8221; Rosie began, &#8220;but I can&#8217;t do&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you <i>sure</i> about that?&#8221; Dad said quickly, with a little smile. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see, really, you didn&#8217;t <i>want</i> to eat breakfast and you didn&#8217;t <i>want</i> to do your work well and you didn&#8217;t <i>want</i> to listen&#8230;&#8203;isn&#8217;t that so, Rosie?&#8221; She didn&#8217;t answer, so he continued, &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t do anything because you didn&#8217;t want to, so now how about not wanting to be grouchy? If you really want to, you can be happy, Rosie. You can ask Jesus to help you, but you first have to <i>want</i> His help.&#8221; Rosie thought of her mumbled prayer that morning. She thought of how many times she didn&#8217;t want to do things that day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daddy, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s pray then,&#8221; suggested Daddy.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>When Mom called them for lunch, Rosie took her seat with a smile. <i>How silly it was to be sad all morning, she thought. I&#8217;m going to be happy whatever happens, and Jesus will help me.</i> Then she heard what Chad was saying.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing we got the garden all dug up: it was just beginning to rain when I came in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; said Daniel. &#8220;Now we can&#8217;t go on our hike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I made little pies just for the picnic.&#8221; Irene&#8217;s voice was filled with disappointment, and the others looked gloomy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now,&#8221; said Dad, &#8220;there is something we can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked Daniel and Emma at once.</p>

<p>Dad&#8217;s eyes twinkled. &#8220;I think Rosie might know the secret.&#8221;</p>

<h1><del>Can You?</del> <i>Will</i> You?</h1>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty little, but I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; said one little girl who had a hard job to do. She had seen a broken rail on the train track near her house and knew that a train was coming soon. Quickly she called the stationhouse, but the train had already passed by. If it wasn&#8217;t stopped soon there would be a wreck! &#8220;Can you stop it?&#8221; asked the man at the station. She was little, but she was willing to try. Out she ran to wave her apron at the oncoming train, and the engineer was able to stop just in time. The little girl was able to do the big job because she was willing. She could have said &#8220;I can&#8217;t, I&#8217;m too little&#8221;&#8212;and the train would have crashed.</p>

<p>Many times there is something we don&#8217;t like to do, something that seems too hard or too big for us. It may be that the room needs to be cleaned or you have some lesson to learn in school. Do you say, &#8220;I can&#8217;t, &#8217;cause I&#8217;m too little?&#8221; or &#8220;That&#8217;s too hard for me,&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8217;ve tried that before; I can&#8217;t do it.&#8221; But have you really tried?</p>

<p>When you say &#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; what are you really saying? &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to&#8212;I won&#8217;t.&#8221; It is really a choice you are making each time, a choice of what you want to do. &#8220;I can&#8217;t be happy.&#8221; Do you want to be happy? &#8220;I can&#8217;t get that for you.&#8221; Do you want to be helpful? &#8220;I can&#8217;t write nicely. I can&#8217;t draw that&#8212;it&#8217;s too hard.&#8221; Do you want to do your best? How about changing every &#8220;I can&#8217;t&#8221; to &#8220;I will!&#8221;?</p>

<p>There are many things we can&#8217;t do by ourselves, but there is a promise that says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+4%3A19" title="Philippians 4:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 4:19)</span></a></span>
If you have a willing heart, God can help you. Think of all His riches and glory! He is so big and great that we can&#8217;t even imagine it, so He surely can do everything. And He wants to help us. Do you want Him to? When you pray, &#8220;Lord, help me obey and be good today,&#8221; He will help you always obey and be good, if you have a willing heart. Jesus can give you that willing heart if you don&#8217;t have one. He stands ready to help and hear you, but you must really want it first.</p>

<p>Do you have ears and eyes? Use them for Jesus. Instead of saying, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t hear you, Mommy,&#8221; learn to listen. If you have a willing heart to help, you will see the toys to pick up and the floor to sweep, and you can be a blessing. You can if you really want to. Don&#8217;t let &#8220;I can&#8217;t&#8221; come and play. Say, &#8220;I can&#8212;Jesus will help me,&#8221; and just see how many things you can really do!</p>

<h1>Harvest</h1>

<p>Now many of us have come to the end of the gardening season. How does your garden look? Did you keep it watered and weeded? Many times it is easy to let weeds in, and by fall you have weed seeds flying everywhere. It takes diligence to grow a good garden all the way until harvest. It takes diligence to live your life for Jesus all year long. What is diligence? It is to keep on working, no matter how you feel, until the job is done. When the cool winds blow will you have beautiful vegetables or prickly weeds? When hard times come, when you are sad or lonely or don&#8217;t feel well, will you have the fruit of obedience and cheerfulness, or the grouchy and &#8220;my way&#8221; weeds?</p>

<p>Harvest time is a time to be thankful. Who gives us the fruits and vegetables and all the food we eat? We can thank the workers, like Mama, for the cooking and preparing they have done. We can thank God for making all these things grow, for giving us what we need, and for His good care. It is important to say &#8220;thank you.&#8221; It shows that you know that you can&#8217;t do things by yourself and that you need others&#8217; help. It shows that you are glad of their help.</p>

<p>When God has helped us grow fruit in our lives (and to keep out the weeds!) we need to show thankfulness. If someone says &#8220;It was so nice to see your cheerful smile,&#8221; you can say &#8220;The Lord helped me,&#8221; and thank Jesus in your heart. Your garden vegetables won&#8217;t be worth much if you just let them rot in the garden&#8212;you need to pick them and use them. When God has helped you have a willing heart, use it to bless others and serve Him. Don&#8217;t keep it to yourself and let it rot and spoil!</p>

<h2>Sock Darning</h2>
<div class="blurb"><p class="first">It is very useful for both boys and girls to mend their own socks. It is not hard&#8212;ask someone big to help you and just see if you can&#8217;t learn!</p>
</div>


<p>You will need a darning egg, some thread or thin yarn to match the sock, and a needle. Put the egg inside the stocking under the hole or worn place. It is best to mend your socks before the holes show, because holes are much harder to fix. If you have a hole, begin by weaving your thread carefully around it (where the sock is still strong).</p>

<p>Next crisscross the opening with threads, weaving up and down to make a patch. Be sure to keep your stitching smooth and fill in all the weak spots. If the sock is just worn, weave under and over the threads to fill in that spot. Zigzag back and forth, pulling your thread so it is not too loose or too tight. When you are finished, weave the end of your thread into the sock and clip it off.</p>

<p>Now your worn-out stocking is ready to use again!</p>

<h2>Do With Your Might</h2>
<p class="verse">Whatsoe&#8217;er you find to do,
<br />Do it, friends, with all your might!
<br />Never be a little true,

<br />Trifles make the life of man;
<br />So in all things, great or small,
<br />Do the best you can!</p>

<p>&#8220;Grandpa?&#8221; asked Alice, &#8220;Can you tell us a story? Please?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I think I can.&#8221; And Grandpa shut his eyes and thought. Then he said, &#8220;This story is about two people who lived in different countries and in different times, but they both loved God and wanted to do right. It is called</p>

<h1>True Freedom</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+37%2C+39-47">Genesis 37, 39-47</a>; John Bunyan.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Imagine you were a boy growing up in a big family. There were twelve sons, and you were nearly the youngest, but your father loved you best of all. You were a bit spoiled and not very smart, and so you got into trouble with your ten older brothers. You tattled when they got into trouble, and you told them stories of how you would be &#8220;boss&#8221; one day. Of course they didn&#8217;t like you, Daddy&#8217;s little pet, and they got crosser and meaner all the time.</p>

<p>You didn&#8217;t think about it too much until the day when you went to Dothan to see how your brothers were doing with your father&#8217;s sheep. All of a sudden you were grabbed by the arms by the two biggest of them, your coat was pulled off, and you were thrown in a deep dark hole. Your heart beat wildly as you heard their voices talk overhead. They didn&#8217;t care about you at all, and they were planning to get rid of you! What will happen now? You shivered in the dark and thought of Daddy and the others at home. Who will take care of me now?</p>

<p>You saw how much trouble you had caused. But you knew God, and you prayed. You prayed to love and be good, and not be afraid whatever might happen. Soon you were tied up and sold as a slave, but you had freedom in your heart. Poor brothers that stood with the silver coins! They had chains of anger and wrongdoing making them slaves inside. But you were free, because God was taking care of you. Your name was Joseph, and because you trusted in God you were able to help save many people from starving.</p>

<p>Imagine being a man that had lived selfishly and meanly. You used terrible words, and didn&#8217;t take care of your family. Finally you saw how wrong you were and prayed for God to forgive you. You were terribly afraid that He wouldn&#8217;t, but He did. He showed you how He loved you, and taught you to be good. You must tell others about God, about how good it was to serve Him!</p>

<p>But the king was not happy with you and said, &#8220;You have disobeyed the law. Don&#8217;t you know that you can&#8217;t tell about God unless I say so?&#8221; You were cast into the prison with the rats and stinking straw. What would happen to your family now? Should you obey the king or God? You prayed to God for help to follow Him, and you knew that He would take care of you. Though you sat in the prison many years, you were free in your heart because you did what you knew was right. Your name was John Bunyan, and because you trusted in God you were able to write <i>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</i>.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>&#8220;We have <i>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress</i> tapes,&#8221; said Edward excitedly, as Grandpa finished the story. &#8220;Remember? Aunt Beulah sent them to us, and I like them very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And maybe John Bunyan wouldn&#8217;t have written that story except the Lord allowed him to be imprisoned. God&#8217;s way is hard for us to understand sometimes, but it is always best,&#8221; said Grandpa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he have to stay in prison all the time?&#8221; asked Sammy. </p>

<p>&#8220;I read about John Bunyan,&#8221; said Alice. &#8220;He had to stay in prison for twelve years, and he wrote more books, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about Joseph?&#8221; Grandpa asked. &#8220;Do you remember what happened to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He had the coat of many colors,&#8221; said Sammy.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the coat that his brothers took away when they threw him in the pit,&#8221; added Edward. &#8220;And they said that a wild animal had eaten him. They were really mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Joseph forgave them, even though he had to work hard and be a slave,&#8221; said Alice. &#8220;It was probably good for him, because he was so spoiled before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be spoiled and thrown in a pit,&#8221; said Sammy.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Grandpa with a chuckle, &#8220;but if you were, you would want to trust God anyway, and obey Him no matter what, right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uh-hmm,&#8221; Sammy agreed with a nod.</p>

<h1>A Child&#8217;s Devotions</h1>

<p><b>Girl:</b> Let us read from the Bible. <i>Be strong, and of a good courage&#8230;&#8203;He will not fail thee.</i> Do you know what that means?</p>

<p><b>Doll:</b> I don&#8217;t think so, Mama.</p>

<p><b>Girl:</b> Well, <i>Be strong</i> is against the devil. <i>Good courage,</i> hmm, courage is like something you have to do even if it&#8217;s hard. It&#8217;s like&#8212;Sister, how do you explain &#8220;courage&#8221;?</p>

<p><b>Sister:</b> It is being brave and not afraid of what might happen.</p>

<p><b>Girl:</b> So it is like this: you will do it and not be afraid. <i>Good courage</i> is not just a little bit, but a lot. <i>He will not fail</i>&#8212;well, fail means can&#8217;t do it, like that Jesus can&#8217;t do something. But He won&#8217;t fail, like <i>I can do all things through Christ, which strengtheneth me.</i> See, if I can do all things through Christ, then that means He can do all things. Do you understand it now?</p>

<p><b>Doll:</b> Yes.</p>

<p><b>Girl:</b> Now let&#8217;s read another verse. <i>Man looketh on the outward appearance&#8212;but the Lord looketh on the heart.</i> You see, the outward appearance is like your skin, your hair&#8212;what&#8217;s on the outside. Now which one is better: man or God?</p>

<p><b>Doll:</b> God.</p>

<p><b>Girl:</b> That&#8217;s right, God is better. So man looks at the outward things you have, but God looks on the heart. The heart&#8212;you know, if you have arrows of the devil in your heart, or if it is all clean and nice, with God&#8217;s arrows. It&#8217;s like this: maybe there is this ugly person with an int&#8217;resting face, but she had a nice clean heart and she prays. Then, there is a person that&#8217;s real pretty with nice fingernails and a pretty dress and rings on her fingers, but she has an ol&#8217; dirty heart and arrows of the devil, and doesn&#8217;t pray. See? But we want to have God&#8217;s arrows to fight for what&#8217;s right.</p>

<p><b>Doll:</b> I want new arrows.</p>

<p><b>Girl:</b> Well, I will read another verse first, and then we can ask for new arrows.</p>

<p><b>Doll:</b> But can&#8217;t we ask for them first, and then read another verse?</p>

<p><b>Girl:</b> Okay. Let&#8217;s pray.</p>

<p><b>Doll:</b> Dear Father, help me to obey and be happy, and have a good day, and not be selfish. Amen.</p>

<p><b>Girl:</b> Dear Father, help me to be cheerful and not be proud, help me do to others as I want them to do to me, and to be kind and loving. Help us have a good day today and be obedient. In Jesus&#8217; name, amen.</p>

<p>Now I will read. <i>The Lord is my shepherd</i>&#8212;that means we are like sheep in the field&#8212;<i>I shall not want,</i> that is, we won&#8217;t want anything because we have everything we need. <i>He maketh me to lie down in green pastures, He leadeth me beside the still waters.</i> See, the green pastures are like green grass that is the best feeding ground and really good. Eating and drinking, well there are two kinds. One is the regular kind, you know, eating potatoes and bread and stuff. But the other kind is spiritual. Like eating of God&#8217;s Word, reading and&#8212;well, sort of like saving it. And drinking, well, that is the same way.</p>

<p><b>Doll:</b> Can we get arrows again?</p>

<p><b>Girl:</b> Yes, but what kind of arrows do you want? Do you want to fight on the devil&#8217;s side?</p>

<p><b>Doll:</b> No.</p>

<p><b>Girl:</b> Or do you want the love and joy kind of arrows? The devil sends &#8220;disobey your parents&#8221; kinds of arrows, but Jesus can give us the good kind. We don&#8217;t want the bad arrows to stay, but we can have a clean, good heart.</p>

<p><b>Doll:</b> Dear Father, help me have the good arrows. Help me love others and be kind and not disobey my parents. In Jesus&#8217; name, amen.</p>

<p><b>Girl:</b> Amen.</p>

<h1>Couldn&#8217;t and Could</h1>

<p class="verse">Couldn&#8217;t and Could were two promising boys
<br />Who lived not a great while ago.
<br />They had just the same playmates and just the same toys,
<br />And just the same chances for winning life&#8217;s joys,
<br />And all that the years may bestow.</p>

<p class="verse">And Could soon found out he could fashion his life
<br />On lines very much as he planned;
<br />He could cultivate goodness and guard against strife,
<br />He could have all his deeds with good cheer to be rife,*
<br />And build him a name that would stand.</p>

<p class="verse">But poor little Couldn&#8217;t just couldn&#8217;t pull through;
<br />All the trials he met with a sigh;
<br />When a task needed doing, he couldn&#8217;t, he knew;
<br />And hence, when he couldn&#8217;t, how could he? Could you,
<br />If you couldn&#8217;t determine you&#8217;d try?</p>

<p class="verse">So Could just kept building his way to success,
<br />Not clouding his sky with a doubt;
<br />But Couldn&#8217;t strayed into the Slough of Distress.
<br />Alas! and his end is easy to guess&#8212;
<br />Strayed in, but he couldn&#8217;t get out.</p>

<p class="verse">And that was the difference &#8216;twixt Couldn&#8217;t and Could:
<br />Each followed his own chosen plan;
<br />And when Couldn&#8217;t just wouldn&#8217;t, Could earnestly would,
<br />And won with the watchword, &#8220;I can!&#8221;</p>

<p>* Rife means to be abounding or filled with.</p>

<h2>Something You Can Do</h2>
<p>When you want someone to feel special, or they are not feeling well, or when you want to say &#8220;thank you,&#8221; it is nice to give a card. It shows that you care about them and love them. But you don&#8217;t have to buy a card&#8212;it really is more special and fun to make it yourself! (It could save your family some money, too!)</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_9/cards_a.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="217" /></div>
<h1>Make Your Own Cards</h1>

<p>You will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>card paper</li>

<li>a glue stick</li>

<li>scissors</li>

<li>pens, pencils, markers</li>

<li>extras: rubber stamps, magazine pictures, stickers, ribbons</li>

</ul>
<ol>
<li>Fold the card paper into a card, making sure the edges are even. You can make a double card by folding a larger paper over a smaller paper. This is pretty when you have dark and light colors (put the light color on the inside to write on).</li>

<li>Now design your cards. What will the person like the best? If it is a &#8220;Thank You&#8221; card, you can write that on the front. Use your nicest handwriting and write in pencil first. There are many interesting ways to decorate cards. Look at these ideas and think of your own, too!</li>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_9/cards_verses.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="102" /></div>
<p><b>Verse Cards:</b> Write a Bible verse on the front and decorate the edges with a border. Stamp the front or paste on a picture. Open up the card and write the verse inside. Paste a little nature picture and a strip of paper, ribbon, or something else across the front, writing a verse in next to it.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_9/cards_layered.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="155" /></div>
<p><b>Layered Cards:</b> Cut out shapes, pictures, or stamped papers and paste on the front with a bow. Cut out a window or door in the front of the card. Paste a paper behind it to show a special message or picture. Use fabric and buttons to make a patchwork front.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_9/cards_art.jpg" alt="" width="125" height="156" /></div>
<p><b>Artwork Cards:</b> Draw a picture of an animal, flower, or something else on the front. Paint a design or splatter the front with pretty colors. Use a white crayon to draw stars or something else in the night, and paint over the whole picture with black watercolor. The stars will shine through!</p>

<li>You can use your cards right away (remember to write a special message inside) or you can make several and give them with envelopes as a gift. God can help us use our time in ways to bless and encourage others.</li>

</ol>

<h1>Let Me Tell You&#8230;&#8203;</h1>

<h2 class="subtitle">How Good God Is</h2>
<p>God is soooooo good to us. He faithfully guides us along a STRAIGHT and narrow path. He talks to us words of comfort to cheer us up when we&#8217;re lonely or sad, He is the Comforter. Man can&#8217;t ever comfort or love us the way God can. He is the Prince of Peace giving us peace through the stormy sea of life, the Mighty God holding us always by the hand, never failing us when we fall, the Counselor always giving us counsel when we need it, Wonderful (it&#8217;s too great to explain how wonderful He is), His name is also Emmanuel, meaning &#8220;God with us.&#8221; God is ALWAYS with us unless we fail to obey and please Him which I do NOT want to do! I want to do right and serve the Lord faithfully and whole-heartedly and make it in. The Word is SUCH a blessing at all times! It comforts and encourages us! It gives us strength along the way! It teaches us how to serve the Lord. There are so many things it does for us!</p>

<h1>If I Only Had a Chance</h1>

<p>Many a boy dreams of the great things he would do if he only &#8220;had a chance.&#8221; A dozen homely duties are crowding about him, but he wants a chance to show that he is of different stuff from ordinary boys; and so he dreams and chafes at his commonplace surroundings until his opportunities are gone, and then he takes up the wail of, &#8220;If I only had a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys who succeed in life are the boys who make their own chances, or who see in every little thing about them a chance for faithful, conscientious work. Are you poor? Poverty is a stern teacher, through her school. Have you no influential friend to help you along? Turner, the painter, was a barber&#8217;s son; Prideaux, the scholar and theologian, scoured pots and pans while working his way through college. Sir Isaac Newton, the greatest astronomer of his time, once peddled cabbages in the streets. Martin Luther, when a boy at school, sang in the streets for a mere pittance which passersby might give him. The late Judge Bradley, of the United States Supreme Court, was the son of a charcoal-burner workman.</p>

<p>There is more in the boy than the chance. A thousand chances may pass unheeded by a careless, unobservant lad, whereas the boy with the right sort of stuff in him would seize the first one. Patience, faithfulness, truthfulness and downright honesty count far more than chances. Many lads are given plenty of broad fields over which to roam. Yet because of their carelessness, their failing to watch, and their stubbornness, they have been easily reduced to a very few in number. Among men, these three faults have ruined many an otherwise promising life.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+12%3A24" title="Proverbs 12:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 12:24)</span></a></span></p>

<h1>A Cry for Help</h1>

<p>Timothy discovered a new game. He would kick the ball as hard as he could, and Josh would run and get it. He would bring it back to Timothy, and then Timothy would kick it again.</p>

<p>This was a fun game. Timothy loved to see how far he could kick the ball, and Josh loved to run and get it. The higher it went in the air, the happier Josh was. He would clap his hands and laugh.</p>

<p>The ball went over a bush, and Josh giggled with glee. Then Timothy kicked it on the roof of the house, and it rolled down and bounced higher than Timothy. Timothy kicked it again, really hard, and it flew across the yard and hit the neighbors&#8217; chain link fence.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_9/help_dog.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="313" /></div>
<p>The boys ran over to get the ball, but a low, fierce growl stopped them. On the other side of the fence was the neighbors&#8217; big dog. The dog stared at them, and growled through his teeth. Suddenly he ran at the fence, barking madly, and jumped up against the wire, hooking his claws into the links.</p>

<p>Timothy thought of the hole under the fence down by the corner. &#8220;Run, Josh!&#8221; he screamed and grabbed his little brother by the hand. He half-dragged, half-ran with him toward the house. The angry snarling of the dog sounded fainter for a moment. Timothy looked over his shoulder just in time to see the dog furiously work his way under the fence and leap toward them.</p>

<p>It was just a little farther to the house, but suddenly Timothy missed his step and he felt his ankle twist. He fell down, and Josh fell down, too. Timothy rolled over on his brother and hugged him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Jesus,&#8221; he prayed, &#8220;help us now.&#8221; The tears filled his eyes, and he waited for the big dog to bite him.</p>

<p>There was a snapping, zipping noise from the back porch and the dog made a terrified yelp. There was the sound of running dog feet, going away. Then that strange snapping noise came again, followed by a burst of frenzied yelping. The chain link fence rattled and then all was quiet.</p>

<p>Timothy looked up to see Mother standing beside them. In one hand she had a strange, Y-shaped wood thing attached to part of a huge rubber band. In the other hand Mother carried two big steel marbles. They felt really heavy when Timothy held them.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_9/help_slingshot.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="184" /></div>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you could do that,&#8221; he said, when Mother showed him how to shoot one of the steel balls at a tree with the slingshot. The big silver ball hit the tree so hard that it knocked off the bark and bounced over and hit the garage with a bang. You could see the dent where it hit the metal door.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t sure that I could, either,&#8221; Mother replied. &#8220;I prayed and asked the Lord to help me when I made the first shot.&#8221; And all of them knew that the Lord had helped them.</p>

<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Princess,</p>

<p>There was once a sweet, little Princess Precious who lived in the King&#8217;s palace. She ate from the King&#8217;s table with all the other princesses and was kind to each one. She obeyed Mother Matron all the time so her golden gown of obedience had no ugly black holes.</p>

<p>One fine morning Princess Precious was in a mighty big hurry getting dressed. She tossed on her crown of love, but didn&#8217;t have time to adjust her veil of quietness. She almost forgot to slip on her ring of kindness, too, but just in time she snatched it from the dresser. Princess Kind-to-All had planned a party and Precious didn&#8217;t want to be late. She bounded down the steps, quite unlike a princess, and did not notice her ring fall to the floor.</p>

<p>Soon all the princesses were gathered, but Princess Precious felt irritable. When Princess Joy showed her the new doll Mother Matron had given her, Precious wished she had a new one too. Princess Precious had a very nice doll, but it was not new, so she felt sulky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t give me the chipped cup,&#8221; said Princess Precious sharply when Princess Charity handed out the tea cups. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t want one that has faded flowers, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take the chipped one,&#8221; Princess Unselfish said softly.</p>

<p>Just then Princess Kind-to-All came in with a big tray of lovely scones with whipped cream and strawberries on top! As she passed them around, every princess picked one. Princess Precious thought, &#8220;Those scones are awfully small&#8212;I&#8217;ll take two.&#8221; As she grabbed the two biggest, her crown of love slipped off the back of her head, and Precious began eating without even saying &#8220;thank you.&#8221; Suddenly she saw that Kind-to-All looked very sad&#8212;there was not a single scone left for her! Precious felt very ashamed and hung her head, and instead of seeing &#8220;Princess Precious&#8221; written on her gown, she saw the name &#8220;Princess Greedy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Princess Greedy,&#8221; Mother Matron said gently, taking her aside, &#8220;something is wrong. You are thinking only of yourself. What happened to your crown of love for others? Where is your ring of kindness? I think we must talk to King Jesus about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Princess Greedy blinked back the tears as she came before the King&#8217;s throne. &#8220;I am sorry I have b-been so selfish,&#8221; she began. Being greedy did not make her happy at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Precious,&#8221; King Jesus said kindly, &#8220;I forgive you. Don&#8217;t you think I gave you your clothes for you to wear them? I want my princesses to be happy, but that means you must take the time to get ready each day. Why don&#8217;t we put on your crown and ring again?&#8221;</p>

<p>Princess Precious nodded humbly as she knelt down, and over her crown King Jesus spread the veil of quietness. How much better everything was when she was dressed like she should be!</p>
