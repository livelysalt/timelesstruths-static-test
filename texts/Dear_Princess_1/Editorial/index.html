<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>Greetings in the name of our precious Lord and Savior!</p>

<p>I trust this finds you as I am&#8212;greatly encouraged to follow the Lord in life&#8217;s journey. We have had a very busy summer, and it has gone so quickly. A few weeks ago Mommy and I went to a garage sale and found a sewing machine cabinet for a reasonable price. About two weeks later we found a good sewing machine at another garage sale. I am very thankful that the Lord worked this out for us. I am looking forward to using it this winter to sew my own clothes. I want to encourage all young girls to ask the Lord for patience when you are waiting for things. There are two different ways to wait for something. You can nag and complain about how long it is taking, till you drive the person that is doing it crazy. You are still waiting but not very patiently. You also are making yourself and others unhappy. The other way is to wait patiently until it is finished. If it&#8217;s some long-term thing it helps not think about it constantly. This is not easy to do unless you ask the Lord to help you. He can and He will help you. I have wanted a log cabin for about two years. It is still not finished and has a lot of work to be done on it yet. But I am encouraged that the Lord will help me wait with patience until it is finished. The thing that we waited for will seem more precious to us when we get it, than if we had gotten it the moment we had desired it. My mother waited ten years for a husband. All her friends got married and it didn&#8217;t look like the Lord had anyone for her. But she kept on waiting patiently on God, and after ten years He gave her one. It makes the two years I&#8217;ve been waiting look pretty small. Here&#8217;s a song that my mother said was a encouragement to her when she was waiting for a husband:</p>

<p class="verse">Teach me, Lord, to wait, down on my knees,
<br />Till in Your own good time You answer my pleas;
<br />Teach me not to rely on what others do,
<br />But to wait in payer for an answer from You.</p>

<p class="verse refrain_line">Refrain:</p><p class="verse refrain">They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength;
<br />They shall mount up with wings as eagles,
<br />They shall run and not be weary,
<br />They shall walk and not faint;
<br />Teach me, Lord, teach me, Lord, to wait.</p>

<p>We are praying for you. Please include us in your prayers.</p>

<p class="signature">Your sister in Christ,<br />Abigail</p>
