<h1>Editorial</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>Greetings in the name of our precious Lord and Savior!</p>

<p>I trust this finds you as I am&#8212;greatly encouraged to follow the Lord in life&#8217;s journey. We have had a very busy summer, and it has gone so quickly. A few weeks ago Mommy and I went to a garage sale and found a sewing machine cabinet for a reasonable price. About two weeks later we found a good sewing machine at another garage sale. I am very thankful that the Lord worked this out for us. I am looking forward to using it this winter to sew my own clothes. I want to encourage all young girls to ask the Lord for patience when you are waiting for things. There are two different ways to wait for something. You can nag and complain about how long it is taking, till you drive the person that is doing it crazy. You are still waiting but not very patiently. You also are making yourself and others unhappy. The other way is to wait patiently until it is finished. If it&#8217;s some long-term thing it helps not think about it constantly. This is not easy to do unless you ask the Lord to help you. He can and He will help you. I have wanted a log cabin for about two years. It is still not finished and has a lot of work to be done on it yet. But I am encouraged that the Lord will help me wait with patience until it is finished. The thing that we waited for will seem more precious to us when we get it, than if we had gotten it the moment we had desired it. My mother waited ten years for a husband. All her friends got married and it didn&#8217;t look like the Lord had anyone for her. But she kept on waiting patiently on God, and after ten years He gave her one. It makes the two years I&#8217;ve been waiting look pretty small. Here&#8217;s a song that my mother said was a encouragement to her when she was waiting for a husband:</p>

<p class="verse">Teach me, Lord, to wait, down on my knees,
<br />Till in Your own good time You answer my pleas;
<br />Teach me not to rely on what others do,
<br />But to wait in payer for an answer from You.</p>

<p class="verse refrain_line">Refrain:</p><p class="verse refrain">They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength;
<br />They shall mount up with wings as eagles,
<br />They shall run and not be weary,
<br />They shall walk and not faint;
<br />Teach me, Lord, teach me, Lord, to wait.</p>

<p>We are praying for you. Please include us in your prayers.</p>

<p class="signature">Your sister in Christ,<br />Abigail</p>

<h1>Leaving All in His Hands</h1>

<p class="author">Laura S. Erickson</p>

<p>One afternoon, when the little things seemed like mountains and a little change like a disaster, I went off by myself to think and pray. I took my cares, fears, and troubles to my loving Heavenly Father and found sweet peace in knowing that He would take care of me.</p>

<p>Often we feel as if we have the responsibility to run our life; we think we should make sure everything works out well and goes smoothly&#8212;then we become worried, anxious, and burdened under the load we have taken upon ourselves. But the Lord wants us to give this great responsibility to Him, to leave everything in His hands. Simply trust. The One who made you is surely able to take care of you&#8212;much better then we ourselves, for we don&#8217;t know all that we need, and the most perfect way to run our lives, but our Creator does.
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+4%3A19">I&nbsp;Peter 4:19</a>
says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Commit the keeping of your souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.&#8221;</span>
</p>

<p>As a child so completely trusts his parents to take care of him, so we, as children of God, should trust our Heavenly Father who knows best of all how to take care of us. When we are troubled and careworn, let us draw close to Him. What sweet assurance there is in knowing that He knows perfectly how to take care of me! He loves us so much and wants the best for us, but only if we leave everything in His hands is He able to direct and manage our lives in the most perfect way possible.</p>

<h1>Perfect Patience</h1>

<p class="author">Charles E. Orr</p>

<p>The apostle prays that we might be <span class="scripture">&#8220;Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+1%3A11" title="Colossians 1:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 1:11)</span></a></span> Notice the small word <i>all</i>. Then James says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+1%3A4" title="James 1:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 1:4)</span></a></span> It appears, from these words, that we are not perfect except patience has her perfect work, and neither are we entire. If a wheel in a watch is bent out of its proper shape, the watch is not perfect. If patience does not have her perfect work in us, we are not perfect. If all the wheels in the watch are perfect, but one small wheel is missing, then the watch is not entire. If patience does not have her perfect work in us, we are not entire&#8212;neither perfect nor entire. Now we are to give to every text their proper meaning. This text does not say that we are not to have our patience tried, but it does say that when it is tried, to let it have its perfect work. If we will do this, it will work the beauty of perfect holiness in our lives.</p>

<p>There are two forms or acts of patience. These are very closely associated and spring from the same source, yet they do not affect us just the same. One of the works of patience is to wait for some desired thing without discouragement. Now this means everything. We believe that many people do not get answers to their prayers because they do not wait long enough. They get discouraged and cease to expect or hope. Another form or work of patience is to suffer without murmuring. To wait for something we greatly desire without becoming discouraged and to endure suffering of any kind without complaining requires a Christian fortitude and strength that is not possessed by everyone, but it is the privilege of all. Young Christians should develop in this virtue.</p>

<p>You will find at least three especial ways for the exercise of patience and you will frequently be called upon for this exercise. The first is the exercise of patience toward others. Very few people, if thrown into close contact with each other, do not become more or less a trial to each other. Seldom do we find two people, who if thrown into close contact with each other, do not become more or less a trial to each other. Very few brothers and sisters, husbands and wives but what are some trial to each other betimes. This is no sin, but is an opportunity for the development of patience.</p>

<p>Another exercise for patience is toward yourself. You may become impatient with yourself because you are not becoming more patient. You should not grow impatient with yourself because you do not arrive at perfect patience in a week or month or year. Let me tell you now, dear young folks, that perfection of character is not formed in a day. If your progress is slow, be patient with yourself. Real true spiritual progress, as a rule, does not make much showing in a week or month. Maybe at the end of the year you can see you have made some gains. Rapid &#8220;progress&#8221; is not usually the firmer, nobler, finer quality.</p>

<p>The third exercise of patience is toward God. Be patient with God. You say you never get impatient with God. Do not be too sure of this. Do you sometimes get tried because you do not see results? Don&#8217;t you sometimes become tempted to hurry the Lord up a little? Are you not sometimes tempted to think your especial work is moving too slowly? Be careful in this that you do not get a little impatient with God. Wait on Him with patience.</p>

<hr />
<div class="blurb">
<p class="first">When you are being impatient, you are also being selfish. If you are impatiently waiting for your mother to hurry up and get off the phone, you are being selfish. You want to talk to her&#8212;you don&#8217;t want the other person to&#8212;right now. It might be a good idea, that when you are impatiently waiting for something, to use those precious moments to ask the Lord to take the impatience and selfishness out of your life, and He will help you right there.</p>

<h2>If Jesus Came to Your House</h2>
<p class="verse">If Jesus came to your house<br />To spend a day or two,<br />If He came unexpectedly,<br />I wonder what you&#8217;d do.</p>

<p class="verse">I know you&#8217;d give the nicest room<br />To such an honored Guest,<br />And all the food you&#8217;d serve to Him<br />Would be the very best.</p>

<p class="verse">And you would keep assuring Him<br />You&#8217;re glad to have Him there,<br />That serving Him in your own home<br />Is joy beyond compare!</p>

<p class="verse">But when you saw Him coming,<br />Would you meet Him at the door<br />With arms outstretched in welcome<br />To your heavenly Visitor?</p>

<p class="verse">Or would you have to change your clothes<br />Before you let Him in?<br />Or hide some magazines, and put<br />The Bible where they&#8217;d been?</p>

<p class="verse">Would you keep right on saying<br />The things you always say?<br />Would life for you continue<br />As it does from day to day?</p>

<p class="verse">Would you sing the songs you always sing<br />And read the books you read,<br />And let Him know the things on which<br />Your mind and spirit feed?</p>

<p class="verse">Would you take Jesus with you<br />Everywhere you&#8217;d plan to go?<br />Or would you maybe change your plans<br />For just a day or so?</p>

<p class="verse">Would you be glad to have Him meet<br />Your very closest friends?<br />Or would you hope they&#8217;d stay away<br />Until His visit ends?</p>

<p class="verse">Would you be glad to have Him stay<br />Forever&#8212;on and on?<br />Or would you sigh with great relief<br />When He, at last, was gone?</p>

<p class="verse">It might be interesting to know<br />The things that you would do<br />If Jesus came in person<br />To spend some time with you.</p>

<h2>I Am My Neighbor&#8217;s Bible</h2>
<p class="verse">I am my neighbor&#8217;s Bible;<br />He reads me when we meet;<br />Today he reads me at home&#8212;<br />Tomorrow, in the street.<br />He may a relative or friend<br />Or slight acquaintance be;<br />He may not even know my name,<br />Yet he is reading me.</p>

<p class="verse">And, pray, who is this neighbor,<br />Who reads me day by day,<br />To learn if I am living right,<br />And walking as I pray?<br />Oh, he is with me always,<br />To criticize or blame;<br />So worldly-wise in his own eyes,<br />And &#8220;Sinner&#8221; is his name.</p>

<p class="verse">Dear Christian friends and brothers,<br />If we could only know<br />How faithfully the world records<br />Just what we say and do;<br />Oh, we would write our record plain,<br />And come in time to see<br />Our worldly neighbor won to Christ<br />While reading you and me.</p>
