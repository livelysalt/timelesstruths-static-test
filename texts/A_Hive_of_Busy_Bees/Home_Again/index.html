<h1>Home Again</h1>

<p>The sunlight was streaming in at their bedroom windows, when Joyce and Don awoke the next morning. They dressed quickly, and ran down to watch Grandma pack their lunch for the trip home. At the breakfast table, they talked of all the nice times they had had during the past few weeks; and they promised to persuade Mother and Daddy to come with them to the farm next summer.</p>

<p>When everything was ready, Grandpa lifted the little trunk to his shoulder and carried it out to the car; and soon they were on their way. When they reached the station Grandpa bought the tickets, checked the little trunk, and gave the children a story book to read on the train. Dear Grandpa and Grandma! They always knew just what to do to make the children happy.</p>

<p>As the train whistled in the distance, Don caught Grandpa&#8217;s hand and held it tight. Joyce threw her arms around Grandma and whispered, &#8220;Dear Grandma, I love you! And I&#8217;ve had such a happy time!&#8221;</p>

<p>The train pulled up, and the conductor called, &#8220;All aboard!&#8221; After Grandpa had helped them on to the train, and had gone back to the station platform, the children waved and threw kisses through the window. As the train moved away, they pressed their faces to the window and watched Grandpa and Grandma as long as they could. But they soon were left behind, the train moved faster, and the little village passed out of sight. Happy vacation days on the farm had come to an end.</p>

<p>For a few moments the children had to fight to keep back the tears. Then Joyce opened the book that Grandpa had given them, and soon their loneliness was forgotten.</p>

<p>There was a story about a little lame dog that came to a man&#8217;s house one cold winter night and whined about the door. He let it in, bound up its foot, and gave it some food and a comfortable place to sleep.</p>

<p>The man liked the dog so well that he decided to keep it. One night, when everyone was asleep, the house caught fire; and the dog awakened the man in time to save the whole family from burning to death.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../A_Hive_of_Busy_Bees/14_home.gif" alt="" width="250" height="371" /></div>
<p>There were stories about cows and horses; and a long, long one about the interesting animals to be seen at the zoo.</p>

<p>One story was so funny that when Don read it, he burst out laughing; and the other passengers looked at him and smiled. It was about a mischievous monkey at the zoo. One day a gentleman who wore a wig came by, carrying his hat in his hand. The monkey reached through the bars and caught hold of the wig, pulling it off his head.</p>

<p>When it was time for lunch, Joyce opened the basket that Grandma had packed for them. They spread out a napkin on the seat in front of them, and ate their lunch off this &#8220;table&#8221; in the most grown-up fashion. Grandma had tucked in several surprises; and how good the cookie men tasted!</p>

<p>In the middle of the afternoon they began to pass through the suburbs of the city, and soon familiar sights came into view. When the train backed into the station, there stood Mother and Daddy waiting for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother,&#8221; cried Joyce with a bear hug, &#8220;I&#8217;ve had a good time, but I&#8217;m so glad to see you again!&#8221; Don, big boy that he was, had jumped into Daddy&#8217;s arms. Soon the little trunk had been placed in the car, and they were driving toward home.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you enjoy most of all, during your vacation?&#8221; asked Mother, as they were eating supper that evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fishing,&#8221; replied Don quickly.</p>

<p>Joyce did not answer; she sat quite still, with a far-away look in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did my little girl like best of all?&#8221; asked Mother at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother,&#8221; said Joyce, her eyes shining, &#8220;I was happy every minute&#8212;even when the old turkey gobbler was chasing me around the tree. But what I liked best was to sit out on the porch in the evenings, and listen to the katydids and whippoorwills, and watch the stars come out one by one. And then it was so nice to sit close to Grandma&#8217;s old rocking chair and listen to her stories about the Hive of Busy Bees.&#8221;</p>
