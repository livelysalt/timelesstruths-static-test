<h1>A Drink of Cold Water</h1>

<p>&#8220;Daniel, Mrs. Shutter has to go be with her sick mother today. I suggested that Brad and Larry could stay with us. How would you like that?&#8221; Mom asked. &#8220;They could help you with weeding and fixing the chicken yard fence this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think they like to work,&#8221; Daniel said slowly. He thought of the two redheaded neighbor boys and sighed. Larry was his age and Brad was two years younger. All they liked doing was arguing over toys or playing Nintendo.</p>

<p>Mom only smiled. &#8220;Most children don&#8217;t like to work. If you ask Jesus to help you be cheerful and set a good example, I&#8217;m sure they will see it is not that bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides, the more hands make the lighter work,&#8221; added Irene, looking up from her desk.</p>

<p><i>That is just the sort of thing a big sister would say,</i> Daniel thought. <i>With Larry along I think it will be <b>more</b> work. He always likes to make trouble.</i></p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_26/water_boys.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="207" /></div>
<p>Daniel didn&#8217;t have long to worry about extra work. Mom was still talking about the Shutters when their car pulled in the drive and the two boys got out. They didn&#8217;t look too happy when Mom opened the door to let them in.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is good to see you, boys,&#8221; she said brightly. &#8220;Daniel will be working outside this morning and I thought you would like to help him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Larry looked at Brad and wrinkled his nose. Daniel tried to smile. &#8220;Come on, you haven&#8217;t seen our new batch of chicks,&#8221; he said, leading the way out the back door.</p>

<p>The boys laughed at the chicks when one took off with a fat worm, but then Brad wanted to catch it. &#8220;No, we better get the weeding done first,&#8221; Daniel said. &#8220;Mom wants the weeds in the flower bed pulled out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mom makes you work? I thought it was summer vacation,&#8221; Larry grumbled. He didn&#8217;t move when Daniel got the garden gloves and trowel.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_26/water_chick.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="322" /></div>
<p>&#8220;These gloves are too big,&#8221; said Brad. &#8220;And I can&#8217;t get my clothes dirty. They&#8217;re new.&#8221; He walked over to the chicken yard fence and leaned on it. Daniel ignored them and began pulling weeds as quickly as he could.</p>

<p>Loud chirping made him look up. Brad was holding a chick by one wing and grinning. &#8220;Hey, Larry, look at this!&#8221; he said, and tossed the chick into the air. It flipped several times and flapped wildly before tumbling into the grass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; cried Daniel, jumping up. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know that you could hurt it or maybe kill it? You don&#8217;t dare touch those chicks again!&#8221; He felt angry with Brad, but Larry&#8217;s laughter made him madder. They looked like two mean, red foxes. <i>If they had tails I would tie them together and set them on fire like Samson did, he thought. That would teach them a lesson or two.</i></p>

<p><i>Would it teach them to do right? Are you being a good example?</i> Daniel gritted his teeth and looked at the ground. He still felt the anger rolling around inside and he knew he didn&#8217;t like those boys one bit. How could he?</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, Daniel, I dare to!&#8221; Larry said, climbing through the broken place in the fence. &#8220;You can&#8217;t stop me. You&#8217;re just a sissy!&#8221; He picked up a rock and sent it after the big rooster. Brad went after another chick and the flock scattered in panic.</p>

<p>Daniel&#8217;s face turned red. <i>Why don&#8217;t you give them a punch or two? They deserve it,</i> a little, angry thought said. It was a temptation that he never felt before and Daniel was a little bit afraid. Jesus had said that he shouldn&#8217;t fight those that did wrong, but love his enemies. Did he believe Jesus? <i>Oh, God, help me to do right!</i> Daniel prayed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, Daniel?&#8221; Rosie&#8217;s clear voice came from the back door. Daniel felt like yelling back, but he took a deep breath instead. Rosie ran over to stand beside him. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you stop them?&#8221; she asked, nervously.</p>

<p>Daniel thought quickly. He knew the boys wouldn&#8217;t listen to him, but he had to do something. <i>Jesus said to give your enemy a drink,</i> he remembered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do we have any lemonade or juice popsicles?&#8221; he asked Rosie above the ruckus. The Shutter boys looked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; Rosie said.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_26/water_apron.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="167" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Maybe Mom would let us have some after we get our work done,&#8221; Daniel said. Larry glared at him, but Daniel smiled. He suddenly remembered that Larry wanted to be a carpenter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Larry, I have a real carpenter&#8217;s apron you could use, but I don&#8217;t suppose you could do a fix-up job with it. It&#8217;s kind of hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think I&#8217;m a sissy?&#8221; Larry said, marching up to the fence.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Daniel said cheerfully. &#8220;I just thought you might not like to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see it.&#8221; Larry pushed his way back through the fence and followed Daniel to the shop. The apron was just his size and held nails, tacks, wire, a carpenter&#8217;s pencil and a claw hammer. Daniel could see that Larry was impressed, though he tried to hide it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen better ones, but I guess it could do the job. What needs to be fixed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, just tacking the wire back up on the chicken yard gate,&#8221; Daniel said, turning back to the flowerbed. He noticed that Rosie was holding a little chick and showing Brad how to pet it. He smiled. Maybe things would turn out all right after all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have any half-inch board strips?&#8221; Larry asked from behind him. He was studying the hanging fence and seemed almost friendly.</p>

<p><i>Probably because <b>I</b> am,</i> Daniel realized. &#8220;Yeah. On the other side of the back porch you might find some,&#8221; he said, picking up the trowel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Brad! Carry this board for me,&#8221; Larry called a moment later.</p>

<p>Brad was ready to complain, but Rosie said eagerly, &#8220;Can I help, too?&#8221; In a moment they were having a race to see who could work faster. Larry looked pleased to be the boss and kept the other two busy pulling staples and holding wire.</p>

<p>Daniel couldn&#8217;t help being a little impressed. &#8220;That looks really nice,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I guess no chickens will get through now!&#8221; <i>Or red-headed boys,</i> he thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not with all the staples we put in,&#8221; Brad said, proudly.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_26/water_popsicles.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="133" /></div>
<p>Rosie had disappeared, but in a moment she was back with Mother and a container of popsicles. &#8220;My, what hard workers you have been this morning!&#8221; Mom said as she looked over their work.</p>

<p>Larry grinned as he took a popsicle. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t that bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if you give your enemy a drink,&#8221; Daniel whispered. Rosie smiled.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_26/Do_You_Believe_in_Jesus/index.html">Do You Believe in Jesus?</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Do You Believe in Jesus?</h1>

<p>The Bible is true. You believe that, don&#8217;t you? Probably you know many Bible stories and have learned some verses by heart. Maybe you have your own Bible that you read every day. The Bible is God&#8217;s words to us. But if we believe the Bible we must also live how it tells us to.</p>

<p>In the story, Daniel was tempted to fight the boys because they were being mean. But he knew that Jesus told him not to fight. He had learned the Bible verse that says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you&#8230;&#8203;That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+5%3A44-45" title="Matthew 5:44-45"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 5:44-45)</span></a></span>
He knew that Jesus said it. But did he believe Jesus was right?</p>

<p>Many times you have to make the choice of who to believe. Do you believe it is better to get out of trouble by lying? Or by telling the truth? Is it right to hide when Mom calls? Or should you obey your parents? The Bible tells the right way and Jesus can help us live it. But we have to believe Him and ask Him to help us. And that is what Daniel did.</p>

<p>In Daniel&#8217;s heart he wanted to do right. He wanted to please Jesus and obey Him, because Jesus had changed his heart. But sometimes it seems very hard to do the right thing. That is when we need to quickly pray and ask for help. Jesus said,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+14%3A1" title="John 14:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 14:1)</span></a></span>
Do you believe Jesus?</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_26/Follow_the_Map/index.html">Follow the Map</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Follow the Map</h1>

<p>Have you ever traveled anywhere? You may have ridden in the car to visit someone or go shopping. Or you might like to go on biking trips. Maybe you&#8217;ve even gone on a hike in the woods. I have, and once we almost got lost. It was because we forgot our map. When we found out we were going in the wrong direction, we had to turn around and get back on the right path.</p>

<p>Maps are important. There are lots of paths and roads around, but not all of them will take you in the right direction. If you are traveling in a new place, a map can help you. A map shows which roads go to which places. It shows you how far you will have to go and which is the shortest way. If you don&#8217;t have a map you will have to guess. And that can get you into a lot of trouble.</p>

<p>The King&#8217;s garden is full of paths, so let&#8217;s take a walk. Shall we visit the fountain or go by the lake? The map shows us that we can do both if we take the main path that starts by the front gate. It is beautiful here in the rose garden, but we better not turn on the side paths. Come along, I see the big sugar maple. The path turns left into the woods and right by the lily bed. Which way should we go?</p>

<p>If we are wise, we will take out our map. It shows us that the wooded path goes to the fountain. Here we are! The lake is over there, across that field. Shall we take a short-cut? I don&#8217;t think so&#8212;look at the map! Do you see why we must be careful to not go by what we think is best? In the same way the Bible is our map to heaven. We will only get there if we are careful to follow it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Edward, you know you can&#8217;t have a gun when you grow up!&#8221; Alice scolded. &#8220;Dad doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Edward shrugged and turned away, but Grandpa chuckled. &#8220;So Edward will just have to be like Dad?&#8221; he asked Alice. &#8220;Boys and girls don&#8217;t always turn out like their parents. Let me tell you about one little boy who didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<h1>The Prince&#8217;s Choice</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Kings+18-21">II&nbsp;Kings 18-21</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Manasseh was a prince. He lived in Jerusalem where his father, Hezekiah, ruled as king. &#8220;The best king in Judah since King David,&#8221; some said. When he was young he had cut down the idol groves and broken the idols in Judah. He told Manasseh, &#8220;There is only one living God. We will worship and obey Him, for His way is right and good.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a little boy I am sure Manasseh would sit on his father&#8217;s knee to hear about the great siege of the Assyrians. &#8220;And then when that terrible letter came, I just laid it out before the Lord,&#8221; his father would say. &#8220;How mighty He was to save us!&#8221; Father told, too, how he had been healed of a terrible sickness, when the marks on the sun dial went backwards. &#8220;We trusted in the Lord, and He delivered us when we were in trouble,&#8221; Father said. &#8220;And you, my dear son, must trust Him, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>But as Manasseh grew older he had different ideas. &#8220;Trusting the Lord was all right for my father,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;but I want to be a great, powerful king. I don&#8217;t like to pray to some God I can&#8217;t see.&#8221; In his little heart Manasseh dreamed of having beautiful groves and idols like other countries had. He wanted to have magic powers, too. So he went to the house of God with his father, but he thought of how he would change everything when he was king.</p>

<p>Manaseh&#8217;s chance came when he was only twelve. That was the year that good king Hezekiah, his father, died. And that was the beginning of a terrible reign that Judah will never forget. Young King Manasseh didn&#8217;t waste time with his plans. Soon an idol sat in the house of God and altars stood in the porches. The people trusted no more in the God who had so often helped them, and His ways were forgotten. But an idol couldn&#8217;t help, so the king tried using magic and witchcraft. Manasseh was not a kind, good king and soon everyone was afraid of him.</p>

<p>How sad a choice the young prince made! Manasseh turned from the right way that his father had lived and taught him. And great trouble came to his people because he didn&#8217;t follow the Lord and trust in Him.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The children were sober when Grandpa finished the story. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want to do that,&#8221; Edward said. &#8220;I want to follow the Lord when I grow up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my boy, it all starts now,&#8221; Grandpa said. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t just happen by accident or wishing. You have to respond to God&#8217;s dealings with you when you are young, or you could turn out just as bad as Manasseh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could he be so bad when his father was so good?&#8221; Alice asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was in his heart when he was little?&#8221; Grandpa replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;He wanted to have idols and be powerful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and did he ever turn to God for help to do right?&#8221; said Grandpa.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Alice said slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he went to the temple with his father,&#8221; Edward said. &#8220;Is a temple like a church?&#8221;</p>

<p>Grandpa nodded. &#8220;It is a place where they went to worship God and pray. But just going there and being around his father wasn&#8217;t enough. Manasseh had a choice, and in his heart he chose the evil instead of the good.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at his grandchildren and smiled kindly. &#8220;I pray for you that you will give your lives to God and love Him always. He will surely help you if you trust in Him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Each of us face trials and temptations every day. Are you going to ask Jesus for help today, or try to do things with your own strength?</p>

<h1>The Choice is Yours</h1>

<h3><a name="1"></a>#1. You just woke up, and it is time for devotions. After prayer Dad opens his Bible to <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians">I&nbsp;Thessalonians</a>.</h3>

<h2>Something You Can Do</h2>
<p>Are you ready for another sewing project? It will be best to use a sewing machine, so you might need someone to help you. If you don&#8217;t need a carpenter apron (or know someone who does), you can change the design to make a cleaning or sewing apron. So lets begin on</p>

<h1>A Handy Apron</h1>

<p>Besides a sewing machine, you will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>scissors</li>

<li>a measuring tape</li>

<li>thread</li>

<li>pins</li>

<li>denim fabric (or an old pair of Daddy&#8217;s jeans!)</li>

</ul>
<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_26/something_sewing.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="450" /></div>
<ul>
<li>First cut your fabric. The big piece should measure 12 inches square (15 inches for a bigger person), and the long strip should be 36 inches by 4 inches. The little pieces are for holding loops&#8212;use the loops on the jeans or cut pieces 4 inches by 2 ½ inches.</li>

<li>Now it is time to sew. Ask someone to help you set up the machine for straight stitching with medium-size stitches. Fold the edge of the square over 1 inch and pin it. Sew along the turned-over edge. Fold the strips in half lengthwise (right sides in) and pin together the edges. Sew 3/8 inch from the edge. Sew across <b>one end</b> of the strip.</li>

<li>Have you ever turned your socks right-side out? Turning tie strips are harder. Use a dowel or measuring stick for the long strip and a pencil for the little ones. First poke the pencil into the sewed-up end of the strip. Use your fingers to push the fabric down over the pencil until you see the end poke out. Now pull it inside out!</li>

<li>Fold the hemmed square as the picture shows. Sew along each edge. Turn it right-side out. Now you can sew the pockets.</li>

<li>Next lay your long tie strip (it should be turned right-side out!) across the top of the apron. Each side should have the same length tie. Stitch it to the apron along each side of the strip as the picture shows.</li>

<li>Finally you can add your hang-loops and trim off the loose threads. If you like to hand stitch, you can even put words on the pockets. Fill it up with tools and you are ready for the job!</li>

</ul>

<h1>Good Reading</h1>

<p>The Sugar Creek Gang Series, by Paul Hutchens. To be consistant with a standard of truth and righteousness, we both recommend and have some warnings for these books. The Sugar Creek Gang is a band of young adolescent boys, living in the rural Midwest fifty years ago, always involved in some adventure or mystery. The author portrays each story through the mind of Bill Collins, a boy with a soft heart as well as a quick temper. The first book begins:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">It was the laziest day I ever saw, and so hot it would have made any boy want to go fishing or swimming, or maybe both. I don&#8217;t think I was ever so glad in my life that school was out, &#8217;cause just as soon as I saw those big, fat fishing worms being turned up by Pop&#8217;s plow when he was breaking the garden, I knew what I wanted to do, what I had to do, in fact, or the whole day would be ruined.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Good family life, high values, and a basis of Christianity are set forth in each book, as well as all the twists of events that draw in both boys and girls. Nevertheless, the author doesn&#8217;t give a clear picture of salvation (though several people get saved by &#8220;asking Jesus into their hearts&#8221;) or holiness (fighting to right the problem is accepted), and the focus on adventure may be objectionable to some parents. We would recommend the series, particularly the first books, to those that want a wholesome mystery/adventure story with a realistic portrayal of boys that uphold good values.</p>

<p>Although we prefer the writing style of the originals, you can find the recent editions through Moody Publishers:</p>

<h1>Terry and the Snake</h1>

<p>Terry was spoiled. Since he was a baby his parents let him to be entertained by a big box which showed moving pictures all the time. He had never learned the joy of working hard. It actually made him feel cold! It was silly of Terry&#8217;s parents to spoil him, for life is not mostly play with a little work mixed in. It is mostly hard work with a little play. So Terry had it backwards.</p>

<p>When he began school, Terry got a very unpleasant surprise. He, Terry Johnson, was actually expected to work! Terry went to a school where the teachers really lived for Jesus. And they believed in hard work. Every morning one of them would pray for all the lazy students, and would ask God to help them to have courage to work hard and learn their lessons. That always made Terry squirm.</p>

<p>Brain work wasn&#8217;t the only work expected of Terry. The teachers felt that some hard physical work was healthy for growing boys and girls. And so Terry was taken to the garage and shown a red and black grass-cutting machine with four wheels and had a big handle to push with. Before he realized it, the teacher had started the motor with a roar, and Terry was sweating&#8212;really sweating&#8212;in the heat of the sun, as he strained to shove the stubborn thing around on the lawn.</p>

<p>After five of minutes of this, Terry felt that he was about to die. He went into the school to get a drink of water, but a big teacher stood in his way. &#8220;Water <i>after</i> work!&#8221; the teacher said. Terry began his horrible experience again. Two minutes later, he was back inside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; he began, making a very sad and pitiful face. &#8220;I just remembered that I have a problem with working in the sun. I get real sick and throw up.&#8221; The teacher smiled slightly and replied, &#8220;That will be interesting to see. So get to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>After another five minutes, Terry noticed a brush pile next to the lawn. There were probably snakes living in it, Terry thought. They were probably poisonous. He looked around. The big teacher had gone inside. A little lady teacher was watching him. &#8220;Miss Richardson,&#8221; said Terry, &#8220;there are snakes in that pile of brush!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Terry,&#8221; Miss Richardson replied, &#8220;the only snake around here is the one in your ear!&#8221;</p>

<p>Terry clapped his hands on his ears. There were no snakes there.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t feel this snake,&#8221; the teacher said. &#8220;This snake is the one who talked to Eve in the Garden of Eden,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;He is the devil, and he wants you to be lazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Big tears ran down Terry&#8217;s face as he thought of the horrible work he had to do. &#8220;I just can&#8217;t do this, Miss Richardson,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I JUST CAN&#8217;T!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what the lazy man in the Bible said, too,&#8221; Miss Richardson replied. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t want to work, either, so he didn&#8217;t even get up in the morning.
<span class="scripture">&#8216;The slothful man saith, There is a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+22%3A13" title="Proverbs 22:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 22:13)</span></a></span>
Is an imaginary lion getting the best of you, Terry?&#8221;</p>

<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Princess,</p>

<p>I want to tell you about the day Princess Precious learned a lovely secret. It all started when a bunch of girls visited the palace. They didn&#8217;t look like princesses and they talked all the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you get tired of your old gowns?&#8221; one asked, showing off her bright cape. &#8220;These are in style&#8212;they make you look grand,&#8221; she told Precious. &#8220;Especially when you go to the mall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t go to the mall,&#8221; Precious said. The girls stared at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you get your hair done up? And everyone goes to Ice Queen&#8217;s!&#8221; they said. &#8220;You really need a sparkle sack from the Glitter Shop, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know what to think,&#8221; Princess Precious told King Jesus when she could get away. &#8220;They all know so much and act so fine. I feel really little and stupid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My Precious, those street girls know nothing of being a princess,&#8221; the King said quietly. &#8220;I have much better things for you than Ice Queens and sparkle sacks. Keep your crown of love bright for Me and I will be pleased.&#8221;</p>

<p>Precious felt a bit ashamed. She knew the King was right and she wanted to make Him happy most of all. &#8220;I will try my best,&#8221; she said, smiling. &#8220;What do you want me to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you do it unto the least of these, you do it unto Me,&#8221; He reminded her.</p>

<p>Precious walked out of the courtroom slowly. <i>It would be fun to do some sewing or maybe help Princess Praise in the kitchen,</i> she thought to herself. <i>Then maybe those girls would see I can do something&#8212;but Precious brushed that thought from her mind. No, I will do it for my King.</i> She was just passing the sitting room when Joy called to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Precious,&#8221; Joy said, brushing away a tear. &#8220;Mother Matron told all of the little girls to help pick up, but the others went off and left me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Precious looked at the mess and suddenly she thought of King Jesus&#8217; words. &#8220;No problem, dear. I&#8217;ll help,&#8221; she said. Soon the sunbeams danced over a tidy room once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sister dear!&#8221; Joy said brightly. &#8220;I have to sweep the steps now. What about you?&#8221; Precious thought of the sunny sewing room, but a cobweb on the stairs caught her eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help&#8212;it looks like someone forgot the dusting,&#8221; she said. So Precious brushed out the corners, picked up trash, and wiped the mirrors. &#8220;For King Jesus,&#8221; the busy little princess whispered. At last the evening bell was rung and she slipped away to His throne.</p>

<p>&#8220;My Lord, have I kept my crown bright?&#8221; Precious asked humbly. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t do much, but Joy needed help and we cleaned the halls together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am well pleased,&#8221; King Jesus said, lifting her up by the hand. &#8220;She that is greatest shall be servant of all, my child. Your lovely smile and gracious serving are beautiful to Me, My own dear princess.&#8221; As Precious lifted her shining eyes to His face, He added very solemnly, &#8220;Much more beautiful than all the other girls&#8217; show and glitter.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as Precious stood before Him, you could see the King&#8217;s own glory reflect on her crown and the bright veil of humility glow all around her. She was indeed the fairest and sweetest of all princesses. Do you know her secret?</p>

<p class="signature">With Love,<br />Aunt Faith</p>

We are thankful that no matter how old or young we are, we may each have a part in the work of the Lord, and receive the blessings He gives.</p>

<p>Both spiritual and temporal matters have kept us busy since our last issue. This past month has been made especially memorable by the marriage of Skye to Matthew Wensing, on August 10.</p>

<p>We would be glad to hear from any of you. We welcome questions, and would be very happy to learn how the Lord has been helping you.</p>

<p>For older ones who want to be challenged and encouraged in Christian living, <i>Foundation Truth</i> is published for youths and adults.</p>

<p>We are a God-fearing family that includes Rick and Krista Erickson, Laura (22), Joel (21), Kara (18), and Amanda (10). The publishing of <i>Treasures of the Kingdom</i> is mainly done by Laura and Joel, with help (guidance, proofreading, and contributions) from others.</p>

<p>Notice: we will be working on <i>Songs and Stories (Book 2)</i> as the Lord gives time. If you would like a copy when it is done, please write us&#8212;the music will be available on your choice of cassette or CD.</p>
