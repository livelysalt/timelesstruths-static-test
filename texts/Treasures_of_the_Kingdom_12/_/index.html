<h1>The Difference for Daniel</h1>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_12/difference_daniel.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="433" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Grrrumpf!&#8221; Daniel threw down his pencil and growled again, &#8220;Humpf! If it wasn&#8217;t for these stupid subtraction problems I would probably get 100%. Multiplying is a whole bunch easier. Two times two is four, four times four is sixteen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still doing your math?&#8221; Chad asked, stopping by Daniel&#8217;s desk. &#8220;It&#8217;s really nice out. Hurry up so we can work on our tree fort before lunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>am</i> hurrying,&#8221; Daniel muttered. Chad disappeared outside, and Daniel slowly reached for his pencil. If it wasn&#8217;t for that one horrid problem&#8230;.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess what!&#8221; Rosie poked her cheery face in the door. &#8220;I found a robin&#8217;s nest. Want to see it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to do my math still,&#8221; Daniel said, frowning. &#8220;And I can&#8217;t do story problems, so I have to stay here the rest of the day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll help you,&#8221; Rosie said, coming in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t. You don&#8217;t know them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can try at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel crossed his arms and squinted at his sister. Why did she have to be so cheerful about it? Math wasn&#8217;t usually so easy for her. He watched her look at the math problem.</p>

<p>&#8220;If a 1998 Ford was selling for $12,050 and a 1997 Toyota was priced at $9,580, what is the difference in price between them?&#8221; Rosie read slowly, stumbling over quite a few of the hard words. After staring at the sentence with a furrowed brow, she said, &#8220;I guess you have to find the difference, like it says.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha,&#8221; Daniel said, scornfully. &#8220;What is the difference anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosie bit her lip, but she only said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Maybe you have to see what makes them different from each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel scribbled on the corner of his paper and didn&#8217;t look at Rosie. He knew he had been mean, but why did she have to be nice about it? He waited for her to walk away, but she only stood there. Finally he looked up and asked gruffly, &#8220;What do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come outside with me?&#8221; she asked, hopefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess so,&#8221; Daniel said with a frown. He slapped his book shut and shoved it into his desk. &#8220;I can&#8217;t finish this math anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Together they entered the fresh air and sunshine. Rosie led the way with a little skip and her cheeks were soon glowing with a smile once more. Daniel followed, dragging his feet through the dew-wet grass until he felt the water oozing through his tennis shoes. He felt glum and grouchy, and now his shoes squeaked their complaints, too. Why could this day be so sunny for someone else, and not for him? What was the difference?</p>

<p>&#8220;There you are, Daniel,&#8221; Chad called from the tree fort. &#8220;Come up and help!&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel turned his steps toward the tall maple tree, but as he climbed up the ladder he felt his heart sink even more. Some one else was up playing in <i>his</i> tree fort, and he knew who it was. &#8220;Why are Kyle and Emma here?&#8221; he asked, glaring at the two invaders. &#8220;I thought this was only for the big kids.&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_12/difference_kyle.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="238" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I told Mom I could watch them better up here. They won&#8217;t hurt anything and, besides, now we can&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does Kyle have, then?&#8221; Daniel interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nes. Nes. See?&#8221; Kyle said, happily poking at a mass of twigs and mud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that my bird&#8217;s nest?&#8221; Rosie scrambling onto the plank floor, dropping her fistful of dandelions and daisies. She hurried to take the nest from Kyle, but it only crumbled in her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8212;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; Emma said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know it was yours.&#8221; Rosie stood silently, blinking back tears. Daniel felt more angry than ever, but Rosie only knelt down to brush the twigs and mud into a pile. Then she gathered her fallen flowers and handed them to Emma and Kyle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a bouquet of flowers I brought you,&#8221; she said, kindly. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t play with the nests I get. I&#8217;m try to start a collection, OK?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll try to be more careful, too,&#8221; Chad said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know he&#8217;d wreck it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right.&#8221; Rosie smiled, but Daniel only frowned more. How could she?</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>That day didn&#8217;t go very well for Daniel. Sometimes he tried to be cheerful, but it seemed that everything went wrong. Lunch was late because Mom was late coming back from town. Then they had to peel potatoes instead of riding bikes. Daniel&#8217;s sour mood only got sourer when Rosie began to sing &#8220;I&#8217;ll Be a Sunbeam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Daniel Otis.&#8221; When Mom called him that, Daniel knew he was in trouble, but he didn&#8217;t care, really. &#8220;You know it is not kind to grab. Please come to my room.&#8221; Leaving the potato, Daniel slid from his seat and trudged after Mom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daniel, I know you&#8217;re disappointed about not going bike riding, but I expect you to do your work cheerfully. Why don&#8217;t you take time to pray and ask the Lord to help you have a good attitude?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too hard.&#8221; Mom was silent, but her gentle smile told Daniel she wouldn&#8217;t accept that for an answer. Finally Daniel burst out, &#8220;I&#8217;ve tried all day, and I just can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you mind telling me about it?&#8221; Mom asked. So, slowly, bit by bit, Daniel gave her the story, from the beginning with the terrible math problem.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you bring me your math book,&#8221; Mom said, pleasantly. She looked at the problem and then said, &#8220;This is subtraction, so that means to find the difference between the smaller number and the bigger number. The answer is the difference, see?&#8221; She lined them up for Daniel on his paper. &#8220;Now can you do it?&#8221; Daniel nodded, and soon had the problem worked. When he looked up, Mom was gone. For a long time he sat thinking, and then he went to find Rosie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Rosie, for being mean about things,&#8221; he said, and bit his lip. &#8220;You were right about the math, too&#8212;I&#8217;m sorry I was cross.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosie smiled and said, &#8220;Jesus helped me to smile. And do you remember about the nest Kyle wrecked up? I was really upset about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then how did you&#8212;how <i>could</i> you be nice like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I prayed. Jesus helped me to remember that I must love those that hurt me. And it is so much nicer to make others happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel looked at his sister closely, and slowly returned her smile. Now he knew what made the difference: it was <i>Jesus</i>, not just trying, that gave her that smile.</p>

<h1>How Jesus Makes the Difference</h1>

<p>Thomas, a disciple of Jesus, once asked Him,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;How can we know the way?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+14%3A5" title="John 14:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 14:5)</span></a></span>
Jesus had been talking about heaven and the mansions prepared for us there. Heaven is a place we all want to go to, isn&#8217;t it? We imagine it being full of sunshine and flowers and angels playing harps, but we don&#8217;t really know what it is like. We <i>do</i> know it is a good and happy place to be. And we all want to be happy, don&#8217;t we? But how can we go to heaven?</p>

<p>Listen to what Jesus said to Thomas and what He says to us, too: <span class="scripture">&#8220;I am the way.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+14%3A6" title="John 14:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 14:6)</span></a></span>
How can Jesus be the way? He is not a road to walk on or a book to read, but He is our Savior and Example. An example is something to copy. Can we copy Jesus? We can copy Him and live like He did when He makes our heart clean. When we belong to Jesus we <i>want</i> to follow and obey Him. And when we follow and obey, He will lead us on the way to Heaven.</p>

<p>Jesus also said that He was <span class="scripture">&#8220;the truth, and the life: no man [that means boys and girls, too] cometh unto the Father, but by me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+14%3A6" title="John 14:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 14:6)</span></a></span> If Jesus is the Truth, we can believe and trust Him. He won&#8217;t tell us any lies or lead us to the wrong place, will He? When we are His, then we can pray to God and He will hear us. God listens to Jesus because He is God&#8217;s beloved Son. In that way, Jesus is like our door to God and Heaven. God becomes our Father and heaven becomes our home. What a wonderful thing!</p>

<p>When we are saved, Jesus becomes our life. His life is from heaven and has all those wonderful things: patience, gentleness, love, and joy. We have heaven in our heart when we walk with Jesus and obey Him. Just like Rosie, He will help us to live right even when things are hard. He brings the sunshine and love of heaven to us, and when things go wrong, we can always pray to our heavenly Father for help. So when we live for Jesus, He <i>is</i> our way to heaven&#8212;and He makes the difference.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_12/The_Cheery_Chickadee_Joy/index.html">The Cheery Chickadee: Joy</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<p>Who is the animal friend we will meet today? In the winter he comes flitting to snatch a sunflower seed from our feeder, and the summer days are filled with his whistles from the tree branches. Dressed in gray and white with a black chin and cap, I&#8217;m sure you must have met him,</p>

<h1>The Cheery Chickadee: Joy</h1>

<p>Hear him out the window? &#8220;Yes, yes! Joy, joy! Cheeri-ly-ly-ly!&#8221; he sings. Is he happy because he doesn&#8217;t have to work? Not at all! In fact, the busier he is, the more I hear him sing. There he flies to a branch where his little black bill gets to work digging out grubs&#8212;one, two, three. &#8220;Cheeri-ly-ly-ly!&#8221; he calls to Mrs. Chickadee, who is looking at the underside of a leaf for a spider. &#8220;Yes, yes, yes, cheeri-ly-ly,&#8221; she chirps and hurries to take the baby birds a bite to eat. They don&#8217;t seem to be complaining or worrying at all, do they?</p>

<p>I think we can learn a lesson from our little feathered friends. God gave the birds voices to sing, and He gave you and I one, too. Just like we listen to the birds&#8217; cheerful voices, God listens to ours. Do you think it makes Him happy when we are making a joyful noise instead of a complaining or arguing one? I think so. When there&#8217;s work to do and we don&#8217;t have time to play, remember to sing a cheerful song. Even work is fun when we are happy!</p>

<p>The little chickadee is God&#8217;s reminder to us to be joyful. Joy in the Lord is our strength, the Bible says. How? It can give us a smile to keep going. It reminds us of God&#8217;s love and care and all the good things He&#8217;s done. And isn&#8217;t He able to help us and give us strength when things are hard? Sing, &#8220;Yes, yes, yes! Cheeri-ly-ly!&#8221; and remember God will help you to face today with a smile.</p>

<h2>Be a Bird Scout</h2>
<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_12/gems_wren.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="84" /></div>
<p>Just like the chickadee that we learned about, birds are fun to watch and teach us many lessons. You can find a bird guide in the library or get one from a bookstore. Take that, and along with binoculars (or keen eyesight), and you can begin your scouting adventures.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_12/gems_swallow.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="135" /></div>
<p>Learn to recognize the birds by their habits&#8212;</p>

<ul>
<li>swallows glide around, catching bugs in the air</li>

<li>nuthatches and creepers cling to tree trunks</li>

<li>ducks stay in or around the water</li>

<li>robins, doves, and starlings eat on the ground</li>

<li>goldfinches and flickers fly in short swoops</li>

</ul>
<p>Or look for colors&#8212;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_12/gems_jay.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="139" /></div>
<ul>
<li>blue = jays, bluebirds, and swallows</li>

<li>brown = wrens, sparrows, and thrushes</li>

<li>orange or yellow = oriole, goldfinch, or warbler</li>

<li>greenish = vireo, flycatcher or phoebe</li>

<li>black and white = nutcracker, magpie, or chickadee</li>

<li>black = starlings, crows, and blackbirds</li>

</ul>
<p>Each bird has its own feather pattern, and also its own song. Learn to listen and watch for the details. Just like children, God made them all different and special in their own way. This year, see how many birds you can discover!</p>

<hr />
<p class="verse">If I can know a bird<br />By head and tail and wings,<br />And by the way it struts,<br />Or tips its head and sings;</p>

<p class="verse">If flowers can be told<br />By place and hue and size,<br />The fragrance that they give,<br />And shape that never lies;</p>

<p class="verse">If rocks and fish and bears<br />Have each their certain ways&#8212;<br />So butterflies and trees,<br />And even mayonnaise;</p>

<p class="verse">If now I look at you<br />And pouts do twist your face<br />Or angry words are told<br />I see this word: Disgrace.</p>

<p class="verse">Or else it be a smile,<br />A helpful hand to cheer;<br />If Jesus you are like,<br />I&#8217;ll gladly call you &#8220;Dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grandpa,&#8221; Edward said, perching next to him, &#8220;Why does God let bad things happen? Dan says it&#8217;s silly to pray and act so happy and stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t know God, you don&#8217;t know what He&#8217;s really like,&#8221; replied Grandpa, leaning back to tell a story. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad I know Him, <i>especially</i> when things go wrong.&#8221;</p>

<h1>The Dungeon&#8217;s Song</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+16%3A12-34">Acts 16:12-34</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Philippi was a large and bustling city during the time of our story, with a great highway through it leading from Rome to Asia. All sorts of people lived there, poor and rich, happy and sad, those that loved God and those that didn&#8217;t, including one jailer and his family. We will call his daughter, Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was quite a stir in town today,&#8221; Bess&#8217; father said one night. &#8220;A couple strangers have started a riot and upset the city, but they&#8217;re getting flogged and imprisoned tonight.&#8221; Bess shivered. She didn&#8217;t like to see the prisoner&#8217;s backs get slashed and bloody. But that was part of a jailer&#8217;s job, and the bad men must be punished.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did they do?&#8221; Mother asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re teaching unlawful customs, even bewitching the merchant&#8217;s fortune-telling girl and&#8230;&#8203;oh, here they come in the gate now!&#8221; Bess followed her father out the door and stared at the strange men. Their clothes were ripped and bloody, and the angry merchant was shoving them along with a stick. The door to the inner dungeon clanged as Father hurried the strangers in, and so Bess slipped in after. Surprised, Bess saw a kind face look up at hers as his feet were being clamped in the stocks. Why didn&#8217;t they shout or swear like the other prisoners?</p>

<p>&#8220;Father, some water&#8230;&#8203;&#8221; Bess said, but he only rushed her out the door and fumbled with the key chain hanging from his belt. The locks clicked and everything was quiet. But Bess could still see the ragged men with their kind faces deep in that dark cell.</p>

<p>It was some time after Bess had fallen asleep that she heard the singing. Was she dreaming? She sat up and listened, but the deep voices continued on joyfully&#8212;from somewhere in the prison. Suddenly everything seemed to spin and shake so that Bess rolled off her mat with a shriek. Banging and snapping sounds broke through Father&#8217;s cursing&#8212;&#8220;In the name of the gods, what&#8217;s going on?!&#8221; He was at the open door holding his sword to his throat and shaking. Bess saw in the moonlight that the prison doors were open.</p>

<p>Just then a shout came from the darkness, &#8220;Don&#8217;t harm yourself; we are all here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get a light, Bess!&#8221; Father cried, in the sudden stillness. He disappeared into the dungeon with a bound, and shivering with fright; Bess and the rest peered in. There stood the unchained prisoners, with Father trembling before them. Surprised, Bess listened as they told of their Master, Jesus, and the salvation that He had bought for them all. &#8220;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved,&#8221; they said.</p>

<p>Could she believe? Bess looked at these men, so strange, yet so kind and cheerful. This was not some strange custom, but something good. These men were different, and she knew she wanted to be, too. She wanted the joy that could break the dark chains of the dungeon. Bess could see it on their faces, even in the dark.</p>

<p>Grandpa paused, and then asked, &#8220;And do you remember how that story finished?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I remember this story,&#8221; said Alice, &#8220;The jailer&#8217;s family all got saved, and then he washed up the prisoners&#8217; wounds and fed them and was really nice to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why was that?&#8221; asked Grandpa, patting Sammy&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because he loved them now, and he wanted to take care of them nicely,&#8221; said Sammy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it Paul and Silas that were the prisoners?&#8221; said Edward. &#8220;It must&#8217;ve been bad to be beaten up and chained down there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Grandpa, &#8220;but they had God&#8217;s love in their hearts, and He helped them to shine out, even in the dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it touched the jailer&#8217;s heart that they were so good and didn&#8217;t run away,&#8221; said Alice. &#8220;I guess he realized that they weren&#8217;t bad men after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grandpa looked at Edward, &#8220;So do you think you have an answer for your friend now? Is it worth it to pray and love God when we get in trouble for it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Edward nodded. &#8220;And God made the earthquake and helped them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And helped the jailer&#8217;s family, too,&#8221; said Grandpa. &#8220;God&#8217;s ways are best because they end best.&#8221;</p>

<h1>A Believing Prayer&#8212;and How It Was Answered</h1>

<h2>A True Story</h2>
<p>Two sisters, the younger about five years of age, went each Saturday morning to get chips and shaving from a cooper shop (where barrels are made). One morning with the basket well filled, they were returning home when the elder one was taken suddenly sick. She was in so great pain that she couldn&#8217;t walk, much less carry the basket home. So she sat down upon it, while her younger sister held her from falling.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_12/prayer_girls.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="348" /></div>
<p>The street was a lonely one occupied by workshops and factories. Every one was busy within; not a person was seen on the street. Looking around, the little girls were at a loss what to do. Too timid to go into any workshop, they sat a while, as quiet as the distressing pains would allow.</p>

<p>Soon the elder girl said, &#8220;You know, Annie, Mother has told us that if we ever got into trouble we should pray, and God would help us. Now you help me to get down upon my knees, and hold me up, and we will pray.&#8221; So there, on the sidewalk, the two little children asked God to send someone to help them home.</p>

<p>When the simple short prayer was ended, the sick girl was again helped up, and sat on the basket to await the answer to their prayer. Presently Annie saw, far down the street on the opposite side, a man come out from a factory, look up and down the street and go back into the factory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, sister, he has gone in again,&#8221; said Annie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Vanie, &#8220;perhaps he is not the one God is going to send. If he is he will come back again.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_12/prayer_man.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="313" /></div>
<p>&#8220;There he comes again,&#8221; said Annie. &#8220;He walks this way and seems to be looking for something. He walks slow, and is without his hat. He puts his hand to his head, as if he did not know what to do. Oh, sister, he has gone in again; what shall we do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may not be the one whom God will send to help us,&#8221; said Vanie. &#8220;If he is, he will come out again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, there he is; this time with his hat on,&#8221; said Annie. &#8220;He comes this way; he walks slowly, looking around on every side. He does not see us; perhaps the trees hide us. Now he sees us, and is coming quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>A brawny German came near and asked in broken accents, &#8220;Oh, children, what is the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, sir,&#8221; said Annie, &#8220;Sister is so sick; she cannot walk and we cannot get home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you live, my dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the end of this street; you can see the house from here.&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_12/prayer_carrying.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="273" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;I takes you home.&#8221; So the strong man gathered up the sick child in his arms, and carried her to the place pointed out by the younger girl. Annie ran around the house to tell her mohter that there was a man at the front door wishing to see her. The astonished mother, with a mixture of surprise and joy, took charge of the precious burden and the child was laid upon a bed.</p>

<p>The mother thanked the man, but he continued to stand uncertainly on the steps. She repeated her thanks and finally said, &#8220;Would you like me to pay you for bringing my child home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said he with tears, &#8220;God pays me! God pays me! I would like to tell you something, but I speak English so poorly that I fear you will not understand.&#8221; The mother assured him that she was used to the German and could understand him very well.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the owner of an ink factory,&#8221; said he. &#8220;My men work by the piece, so I keep separate accounts with each. I pay them every Saturday and at twelve o&#8217;clock they will be at my desk for their money. This week I have had many hindrances and was behind with my accounts. I was working hard at them with the sweat on my face, in my great anxiety to be ready in time. Suddenly I could not see the figures; the words in the book all ran together, and I had a plain impression on my mind that some one in the street wished to see me. I went out, looked up and down the street, but seeing no one, went back to my desk and wrote a little. Presently the darkness was greater than before, and the impression stronger than before, that someone in the street needed me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again I went out, looked up and down the street, walked a little way, puzzled to know what this meant. Was my hard work and were the cares of business driving me out of my wits? Unable to solve the mystery I turned again into my shop and to my desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;This time my fingers refused to grasp the pen. I found myself unable to write at all; but the impression was stronger than ever on my mind, that someone needed my help. A voice seemed to say: &#8216;Why don&#8217;t you go out as I tell you? There is need of your help.&#8217; This time I took my hat on going out, resolved to stay till I found out whether I was losing my senses, or there was duty for me to do. I walked some distance without seeing anyone, and was more and more puzzled, till I came opposite the children, and found that there was indeed need of my help. I cannot understand it, madam.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the noble German was about to leave the house, Annie had the courage to say, &#8220;Oh, Mother, we prayed.&#8221; Thus the mystery was solved, and with tear-stained cheeks, a heaving breast, and a humble grateful heart, the kind man went back to his accounts.</p>

<h2>Something You Can Do</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re like any children I know, you like making little projects out of paper, string, and tape, and giving it to someone. But most little craft projects don&#8217;t last long, and soon they have to be thrown out because they aren&#8217;t useful. Do you want to make something special that someone will really enjoy? You can design a</p>

<h1>Cheerful Bird Chimes</h1>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_12/something_parts.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="205" /></div>
<p>You will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>A wire coat hanger</li>

<li>Thin string and a needle</li>

<li>Nails</li>

<li>Contact or wax paper</li>

<li>A bird picture</li>

</ul>
<ol>
<li>1. Begin by deciding the shape. You can keep the hanger in a triangle, or bend it into a diamond or circle. Bend the hook to make a loop for hanging.</li>

<li>2. Now trace around the hanger onto the contact or wax paper. This is where you will put your bird picture. Have someone help you cut it out and stick it together.</li>

<li>3. Thread the needle with the string, and carefully begin <i>whip-stitching</i> (we learned that last time) around the paper edges to hold it to the wire hanger. Tie a knot where you begin and end to hold it.</li>

<li>4. Now for the music! Tie pieces of string from the bottom edge of the hanger close together. Add nails (2 or more on each string) by tying the string under their flat heads. Be creative and experiment to see what works. Nails make a soft chiming, but you can try anything that clangs with a nice sound.</li>

</ol>
<p>Now hang your Cheerful Bird Chimes where the wind will set it to singing!</p>

<h1>Let Me Tell You&#8230;&#8203;</h1>

<h2>My Salvation Testimony</h2>
<p>One night, as I lay in bed, the Lord started dealing with me. I started thinking about where I would go if I died that night. I knew I would go to hell. I didn&#8217;t like the idea so I started crying. Dad heard me and asked what was the matter. I told him I wanted to get saved. He started reading scriptures and talking to me. Then we prayed. I prayed for the Lord to forgive me for fighting, lying, etc&#8230;. Then Dad prayed. I went to bed and was able to sleep.</p>

<h1>What Word Am I?</h1>

<p class="verse">I think about how others feel,
<br />And so I feel that way, too.
<br />My heart will ache
<br />When I see someone in trouble.
<br />I want to show kindness,
<br />And help to those that can&#8217;t help themselves.
<br />Sometimes I&#8217;m upset or sad,
<br />But I cry only because I love you.

<h1>No Longer a Scorpion</h1>

<p>Remember Billy? A lot of things were different around his home after his Mother and Daddy told Jesus they were sorry that they had done wrong. Jesus had changed them inside where you couldn&#8217;t see it, but you could see what happened outside. Instead of yelling, Mother and Daddy would sing. And, every evening, Daddy read a Bible story before they would have prayer.</p>

<p>Sometimes they read Bible verses. Mother had a book that had a list of <i>every</i> word in the Bible! Today Daddy was reading verses with the word &#8220;salvation&#8221; in them. In his big, deep Daddy voice, he read, <span class="scripture">&#8220;But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+13%3A5" title="Psalm 13:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 13:5)</span></a></span> He smiled broadly. &#8220;Amen,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Billy looked at Mother. He could see her saying &#8220;Amen,&#8221; too, so softly that you could only see her lips move. Billy knew what &#8220;Amen&#8221; meant. It meant that what you had heard was true. Once, in school, Billy had been asked a question. The answer was yes, but Billy said &#8220;Amen.&#8221; Everybody laughed, including Mrs. Hawkins, but she knew what he meant.</p>

<p>Daddy and Mother were saying that it was true that they rejoiced in God&#8217;s salvation. Then Daddy turned to another page. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Sing unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+96%3A2" title="Psalm 96:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 96:2)</span></a></span> Billy knew what that meant, too. His Mother and Daddy were different since they got saved, because it showed from day to day, though Billy didn&#8217;t know <i>what</i> made them different.</p>

<p>Mother looked at the scripture references for the word <i>saved</i>, and told Daddy to read <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+2%3A4">I&nbsp;Timothy 2:4</a>. Billy knew that was the first of the two Timothy books, second chapter. He watched Daddy turn to the place: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+2%3A4" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 2:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 2:4)</span></a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Daddy,&#8221; Billy said, &#8220;what does <i>saved</i> mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you the story of the scorpion and the frog,&#8221; replied Daddy. &#8220;Do you remember the scorpion we found in the garage?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy nodded. It was a scary thing with a bunch of legs and two small pinchers in front. Its tail was curved up over its back with a stinger in the end, and it hurt worse than a hornet to be stung. Most things won&#8217;t bother you unless you bother them, but a scorpion would chase you and sting you.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_12/scorpion_scorpion.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="147" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Daddy continued, &#8220;supposedly, a scorpion and a frog were talking once. The scorpion wanted to go across a river, but it couldn&#8217;t swim. So he asked the frog to take him across. &#8216;Oh, no,&#8217; the frog said. &#8216;You will sting me and kill me.&#8217; &#8216;No, I won&#8217;t,&#8217; the scorpion replied. &#8216;If I stung you, we would both drown.&#8217; The frog thought about this. It was true&#8212;if the scorpion stung him as they went across the river, then the scorpion would drown, too. &#8216;Ok,&#8217; the frog said, &#8216;you climb on my back, and I&#8217;ll take you across the river.&#8217; But about halfway across, the scorpion <i>did</i> sting the frog. As he sank beneath the water, the frog said, &#8216;<i>Why</i>? Why did you sting me?&#8217; And, as the scorpion began to drown in the water, he said, &#8216;I <i>had</i> to. I had to sting you because I am a scorpion.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was like the scorpion,&#8221; Daddy said. &#8220;I was a sinner inside, so I lived a sinner&#8217;s life. I did wrong things because my heart was wrong.&#8221; Daddy&#8217;s voice got quiet and husky sounding. &#8220;<i>Jesus</i> made me <i>different</i> inside. He took the scorpion nature out of me, so that I didn&#8217;t want to sting anymore. Now, I am no longer a scorpion, but a <i>saved</i> man. Jesus <i>saved</i> me.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Princess,</p>

<p>Princess Precious was weeding in her garden. Do you have a garden? Well, Princess Precious did, and she liked it very much. She kept all the weeds out and made sure the flowers had plenty of water. Princess Precious took very good care of her garden and so it grew very well. Sometimes she picked her flowers, but mostly she kept them in the garden and thought how pretty they looked there.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_12/letter_garden.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="359" /></div>
<p>Little Joy liked flowers, too. She also had a garden, but because she was so little, she always forgot to water it, and the flowers drooped sadly. For a fact, there weren&#8217;t many flowers. As soon as a bright flower showed its face, Joy would grab it for Mother or put it in her doll&#8217;s hair. Precious thought about this as she weeded her garden. <i>How very childish,</i> she thought, <i>I am very glad I&#8217;m older and can grow a better garden.</i> Just then little Joy ran up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t pick any flowers,&#8221; Precious yelled, jumping up to save her pansies from being stepped on, &#8220;and don&#8217;t run in my garden&#8212;keep OUT!&#8221;</p>

<p>Joy stood still. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t going to hurt them, P&#8217;ecious,&#8221; she said sadly, &#8220;I just wanted to help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Princess Precious felt a bit ashamed, but she said tartly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t need any help&#8212;you&#8217;re too little, anyway.&#8221; She was sorry the minute the words were out, but it was too late. Joy picked up her doll with the ragged flower hat, and slowly walked away. Precious watched Joy brush away a tear. &#8220;Why does she have to help me, anyway?&#8221; Precious argued with herself. &#8220;She tears up my garden so that it looks worse than when I started.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little voice whispered, &#8220;Mother let you cook even though you burnt the toast&#8212;Father let you help paint the shed even though you spilled the paint bucket.&#8221; Suddenly Precious felt very little inside, and she thought, &#8220;Why do Mother and Father do that? I can&#8217;t do things as well as they can, but they let me help anyway.&#8221; Princess Precious bowed her head and said, &#8220;Dear King Jesus, help me to love Joy just as much as You and Mother and Father care about me. Help me to be kind and let her help me. Amen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Joy,&#8221; called Precious, &#8220;Joy, would you like to help me in my garden? I&#8217;d like some help, if you want to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I really?&#8221; Joy was excited. &#8220;May I pick some flowers, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; smiled Princess Precious, giving Joy a hug, &#8220;I love my little helper.&#8221; And just then, Precious felt happier than ever, for King Jesus reached down and gave her a jewel to wear&#8212;the Jewel of Love and Compassion.</p>

<p class="signature">Much love to all princesses,<br />Aunt Grace</p>

<h1>Dear Reader</h1>

<p>With love and expectation, trusting in the King we serve, we finish our second year of publishing. As you know, we have been printing not for earthly reward, but for the treasures of a Heavenly Kingdom. Our prayer is that this paper will shine light for little feet somewhere to reach the Palace Gates.</p>

<p>If you have questions or want to share a testimony, please write. If you are interested in encouragement for Christian living for youth and adults, <i>Foundation Truth</i> is also available.</p>

<p>We are a Bible-believing family that includes Rick and Krista Erickson and their five children: Laura (20), Skye (19), Joel (18), Kara (16), and Amanda (8). The publishing of <i>Treasures of the Kingdom</i> is mainly done by Laura and Joel, with help from others, including contributions from our friends, the Spinks family, and guidance by the parents.</p>

<p class="signature">In the King&#8217;s Service,<br />The Editors</p>
