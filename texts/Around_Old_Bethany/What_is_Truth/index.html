<h1>What is Truth?</h1>

<p>An apparently insignificant event happened about this time, that set in motion influences of great moment, the effects of which are still to be felt and seen. Robert Davis&#8217; sister in Michigan was a regular subscriber to a religious journal. At this time she felt led to send this paper to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert, here is a new kind of religious paper,&#8221; said Mary, who was reading the first copy. &#8220;It has articles in it entitled, &#8216;Full Salvation,&#8217; and &#8216;Unity and Truth.&#8217; How does that sound?&#8221; Turning a page over, she read again:</p>

<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;A definite, heart-searching, non-sectarian religious weekly, published in the interests of the church of God. For the salvation of sinners, entire sanctification of believers, divine healing of the body, and the unity of all true Christians in the faith once delivered to the saints.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My, that sounds interesting,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Church of God&#8217;&#8212;I wonder what church that is. &#8216;Entire sanctification&#8217;&#8212; what does that mean? I heard Brother Jones say on last Sunday that sanctified people were the biggest cranks on earth, and he warned the congregation to lock their chicken and smoke houses whenever they came around. But, just see here, &#8216;divine healing.&#8217; I wonder if that is Christian Science. Let me read that paper,&#8221; and he reached for it.</p>

<p>Robert dropped down into the nearest chair and was soon absorbed in reading. He was gripped by a power he had never known before. He noticed at once a directness, a simplicity, a spiritual flavor, coupled with much quoting of proof-texts, that attracted his deepest attention. He read an article on Repentance, one on Sanctification, and two testimonies of divine healing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon my word! If that isn&#8217;t the plainest-spoken and easiest-understood religious matter I have read in many a day.&#8221; said Robert. &#8220;I wonder who sent it, and if any more will come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next week another copy of the new paper came, and Robert read an article on &#8220;The Church of God, What It Is and What It Is Not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary, this paper is providentially sent to us. We have just decided to search for truth. My soul longs to know God&#8217;s real truth, and I notice this paper has much to say about the &#8216;truth.&#8217; We shall continue our investigation of the doctrines of the denominations and probably this paper will help us,&#8221; said Robert. Before he laid the second issue down, he read the following article on Truth:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Unknowingly to himself, Pontius Pilate asked one of the greatest of questions when he asked Jesus Christ, <span class="scripture">&#8220;What is truth?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+18%3A38" title="John 18:38"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 18:38)</span></a></span> Jesus was on trial before him, and He had just said, in reply to another question of Pilate&#8217;s, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+18%3A37" title="John 18:37"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 18:37)</span></a></span> And then Pilate asked, <span class="scripture">&#8220;What is truth?&#8221;</span> but he did not stop to get an answer.</p>

<p>The &#8220;truth&#8221; to which Jesus often referred means righteousness, true religion, the genuine revelation of the true plan of salvation. This is what the apostle John referred to when he said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;For the truth&#8217;s sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+John+1%3A2" title="II&nbsp;John 1:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;John 1:2)</span></a></span> The &#8220;truth&#8221; in these texts is used in a broad sense to mean the whole range of revealed religion, the whole system of New Testament salvation.</p>

<p>Vast importance is attached to this truth. Opposed to it are error, heresy, damnable doctrines of devils, human theories and philosophies, leading souls away from God and into perdition. The eternal destiny of men depends upon their finding and embracing the truth.</p>

<p>If so much depends upon our finding the truth and obeying it, the important question arises: How and where are we to find the truth? And another question follows: How are we to discern the truth when we see it? It is a fact that most religious people believe that their system of religion is right. They already think that it is the truth; even the most destructive doctrines are received as truth, and some scripture is misapplied or perverted to uphold them. By what means may the false be determined and rejected, and the true be established and accepted? These are very important questions.</p>

<p>There must be a starting point. In the first place, <span class="scripture">&#8220;What is truth?&#8221;</span> as Pilate put it. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Thy word is truth,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+17%3A17" title="John 17:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 17:17)</span></a></span> said Jesus. This is basic. The Word of God is truth. <span class="scripture">&#8220;All scripture is given by inspiration of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+3%3A16" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 3:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 3:16)</span></a></span> God, Jesus Christ, and the Bible are truth. If we conform to the divine will, we are bound to be right, and elected to eternal glory in the heavens; if not, we are doomed to eternal damnation.</p>

<p>But there is no more striking fact than this, that spiritual truths require more than intellect in order to grasp and comprehend them. <span class="scripture">&#8220;For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+2%3A11" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 2:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 2:11)</span></a></span> A man knows the things of a man because he is a man. Common experiences join him to his fellows, and he understands them. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God&#8230;. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+2%3A11%2C14" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 2:11,14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 2:11,14)</span></a></span> Man then, must get in contact with God, through the Holy Spirit, if he is to know spiritual truth.</p>

<p>Jesus tells just how to know the truth. <span class="scripture">&#8220;If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+7%3A17" title="John 7:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 7:17)</span></a></span> The way to know is to obey. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+16%3A13" title="John 16:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 16:13)</span></a></span></p>

<p>The secret then is out, it is as plain as day. It is this&#8212;Jesus brought the truth to the world, and the Holy Spirit is everywhere present to lead men into that truth. Wherever and whenever a person desires to know the truth that he may obey it, there the Spirit of God will be to enlighten and to lead. The Spirit will lead unerringly every soul who wants the truth and will submit to His leadership. He will lead the sinner to sincere and genuine repentance, the believer into true sanctification, and also into the deeper experiences of sanctification and love, and into a true Christian life.</p>

<p>There is a remarkable instance on record, showing what an honest desire to know the truth will accomplish. Years ago a portion of the gospels was washed ashore in the East. The natives read and re-read that portion over and over. What could it mean? It told of Jesus, but who was Jesus? It spoke of His dying, but what for? And yet, so strong was the impression this scrap of the gospel made, that regular periods were set apart to worship the Being hinted at in that portion. An honest effort was made to do His will. After several years, God sent some missionaries to that country, and it was to their surprise to find a tribe openhearted to receive the truth.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Job+22%3A21" title="Job 22:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Job 22:21)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Seek, and ye shall find.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+7%3A7%3B+Luke+11%3A9" title="Matthew 7:7; Luke 11:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 7:7; Luke 11:9)</span></a></span> May your search for truth be abundantly rewarded.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The next few months found Robert and Mary Davis searching the Bible for the truth. Every sermon they heard they compared with the Scriptures. Articles in their new paper helped them greatly. They bought a book of Bible Readings, and made as thorough an investigation of Bible doctrine as they were capable of making. They made rapid progress. They became believers in holiness and sanctification; for the salvation theme held their interest most profoundly, and they became well acquainted with the proof-texts which supported these doctrines. The study of these texts brought great conviction to their hearts, and both of them sought the Lord for forgiveness of their sins, and both entered into the grace of conversion. The joy of this experience made their Bible study still more delightful. They had not been strangers to grace, but they had become slack and lukewarm, and when the light of God began to shine more brightly they felt that they should make sure work of it, and so they began at the bottom round of the ladder. They were glad afterwards that they had done this, because it gave them a sure starting-point.</p>
