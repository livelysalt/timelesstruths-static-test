<h1>A Threatening Quarrel</h1>

<p>Among the old settlers in the vicinity to which Robert Davis and his wife moved was Peter Newby and his family. They were of the old pioneer type&#8212;rugged, honest, and frugal, but they were also headstrong and stubborn, with very little give and take in their makeup. Peter claimed to know the Scriptures from Genesis to Revelation. He could tell the names of the cities and creeks of the Holy Land from Dan to Beersheba, and name the kings of Israel either backward or forward. He had the books of the Bible at the tip of his tongue, and could name the apostles and prophets without hesitation. He was a noted debater or arguer, and met all opponents, large or small, with equal confidence. When reason and logical argument failed him, he relied on a stentorian voice and his power to bewilder. Few were able to hold their own with him in religious discussion. Most men feared his biting sarcasm and insinuating irony. In fact, Mr. Newby had silenced nearly every opponent, and, at the time of our narrative, he stood out as the champion religious debater of the community. He had vanquished all his foes, and now gloried in his supremacy.</p>

<p>But, Robert Davis did not know all of this. He regarded Peter Newby as a good citizen, and probably a good Christian. The next few months, however, put an entirely different face on the matter, especially on the latter point.</p>

<p>Besides Peter Newby and his wife, there were three grown sons of theirs, of whom Jake, and also his wife, figure in this narrative.</p>

<p>Jake Newby was a typical money-grubber, turning everything in the way of financial deals to his own favor. He owned a piece of property which Robert Davis finally decided he would buy. After considerable negotiation, a deal was made, Jake reserving the right to move certain small buildings off the property. Jake began, at once, to move these structures, and more, too. There was a specially built chicken house that had not been reserved by Jake, but which he proceeded to move just as if it had been. Robert and Mary Davis were there.</p>

<p>&#8220;The chicken house was not reserved by you, Jake, and you should not move it,&#8221; said Robert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I intend to move it just the same. I need it,&#8221; said Jake.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the contract does not provide for its removal,&#8221; replied Robert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up,&#8221; snarled Jake, &#8220;I guess I know what I&#8217;m doing, don&#8217;t I? I tell you I&#8217;m going to move this house off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not move it off,&#8221; said Robert, as he started toward Jake.</p>

<p>At this Jake desisted, muttered a few words about getting even, and walked off. Robert and Mary went home later on, rather distressed over the turn of affairs.</p>
