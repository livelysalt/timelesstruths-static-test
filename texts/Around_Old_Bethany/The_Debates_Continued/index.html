<h1>The Debates Continued</h1>

<p>The dust was wiped from more Bibles in the community around Fairmount School, following the debates between Peter Newby and Robert Davis, than for many a day. Even old Mr. Stephenson, who was the most indifferent to the claims of religion, hunted a Bible, and declared he was going to find out which one was right, Newby or Davis. Charley Moss, a goodhearted, but wild, wicked fellow, became interested also. He bought his first New Testament and dedicated himself to the task of reading it through. &#8220;I must find out,&#8221; said he, &#8220;what this young man Davis is talking about. His religion seems to be the real thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next prayer meeting night found the house packed to the limit. Conjectures and opinions as to how the debate would go were passed back and forth. Peter Newby&#8217;s partisans rallied to his support. A few were inclined to accept Robert Davis&#8217; views, while the majority were moved by morbid curiosity to watch the outcome of a verbal conflict. Peter Newby wore an air of entire confidence&#8212;on this occasion he had the seventh chapter of Romans back of him he thought. Nearly every one else who accepted the old theology of the community expected him to &#8220;clean up&#8221; his opponent in grand style that night.</p>

<p>As for Robert Davis, the previous week had been one of prayer and study. He had first entered the prayer meeting with the intention to help along a good work. He had no intention of entering into debate or controversy with anyone. Now, as he viewed the matter, he was surprised to find the role that he was playing. On the first night, he had only intended to stand up for and express his convictions toward a very vital subject&#8212;that of living above sin. He had been a sinner, he had now become soundly converted, had received light on sanctification (though he was not yet sanctified) and holy living, and his only object had been to be loyal to the truth he had found. As it looked to him now, he was one of the principals in a battle between truth and error. He was very young in faith, and it is not to be wondered at if his zeal was greater than his knowledge. Day by day he prayed that the saving truth of the gospel might be made plain to all, and that deadly error might be exposed, and its power to blind the people destroyed, completely and eternally.</p>

<p>&#8220;<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+7">Romans 7</a>,&#8221; called out Peter Newby, who led off without consulting anybody. &#8220;Read the first verse, Mrs. Johnson. Everybody follow the reading. There are so many present tonight that only a small portion will get to read. Pay strict attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the chapter was read, Peter began, &#8220;Neighbors,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you have known me for a long time, and all of you know that I am fair and square to everybody. I try to treat my neighbors right. I have been a Christian a long time. I was baptized fifty years ago in the Big Sandy River. Water baptism is essential to salvation, so somewhere between the time I went down into the water and came up out of it, I was converted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we are studying the seventh chapter of Romans. Paul gives his experience in this chapter. Paul was a great man but he said that he was <span class="scripture">&#8216;carnal, sold under sin.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+7%3A14" title="Romans 7:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 7:14)</span></a></span> Now my experience is just like Paul&#8217;s. He says, <span class="scripture">&#8216;For what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I,&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+7%3A15" title="Romans 7:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 7:15)</span></a></span> and then in verse 19, <span class="scripture">&#8216;For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+7%3A19" title="Romans 7:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 7:19)</span></a></span> This is my experience. I do many things I ought not do, and I leave undone many things I ought to do. This old tongue of mine says many ugly things, and when I get with wicked boys and men I crack my jokes, too, and these hands often do wrong, but, friends, I am trying in my weak way to serve the Lord and to make heaven my home. But I do not expect to be better than Paul. He said that when he would do good, evil was present with him. This is my experience. I would like to do good, but the flesh is too weak, and there is too much sin in me.&#8221; Peter sat down.</p>

<p>Robert Davis arose. Every eye was upon him. Bibles and Testaments were opened. Old Mr. Stephenson was there with his Bible, and very attentive was he. Charley Moss had his Testament open at the proper place.</p>

<p>&#8220;At first glance, it may seem,&#8221; Robert said, &#8220;that Romans 7 upholds a life of more or less sinning in a Christian. A closer view, however, reveals that it does not. The first night that I was present at these prayer meetings, Brother Newby laid down one sound method for interpreting the Scriptures. He said, &#8216;First, one should know who was writing, second, one should know to whom he was writing, and third, one should know what he was writing about.&#8217; This is a sound theory. Let us apply it to the text in question. First, who was writing? Paul. Second, to whom was he writing? To the Christians at Rome. Third, what was he writing about? His experience under the law.&#8221;</p>

<p>This assertion came like a thunderclap from a clear sky. Peter Newby saw, at once, the significance of the statement, and he shifted uneasily in his seat. He riveted his eyes to the text, in an effort to discover some point that would be in opposition to Robert&#8217;s statement. The crowd looked open-mouthed. This was a new doctrine&#8212;they had never heard it explained that way. The interest was intense.</p>

<p>Continuing, Robert said: &#8220;This is made plain by the first few verses of the chapter. Please notice them&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8216;Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+7%3A1" title="Romans 7:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 7:1)</span></a></span> Then he shows in the verses following that Christians have <span class="scripture">&#8216;become dead to the law&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+7%3A4" title="Romans 7:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 7:4)</span></a></span> through Christ, and that they are married to Christ. and bring forth fruit unto God. <span class="scripture">&#8216;But now we are delivered from the law,&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+7%3A6" title="Romans 7:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 7:6)</span></a></span> says Paul.</p>

<p>&#8220;His whole argument, down to and including verse 6, is that we have died to the law through crucifixion with Christ, and are therefore free to marry another. We have become dead to the law, and since death dissolves the marriage vow, we are, therefore, free from connection with the law, and are joined unto Christ. Beginning with <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+7%3A14-">verse 14</a> to the end of the chapter, is given an explanation of how Paul&#8217;s sinful nature brought him into subjection I to its demands. It is a clear testimony of an honest man&#8217;s experience under the old law. By that law he became aware of sin and felt its sinfulness, yet that law brought no grace nor power to preserve him from violating its prohibitions. He desired to do good, but could not. Sin came to life and slew him. Paul was condemned by the law, and yet he could not come from under the condemnation. He was, so to speak, tied or married to a dead body, a law or master which brought death, and he wondered where deliverance would come from. &#8216;Thank God,&#8217; he says, &#8216;it will come through Jesus Christ the Lord.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;This cannot be the experience of Christians,&#8221; said Robert. &#8220;If you will just look at the second verse of chapter 8, you will find these words: <span class="scripture">&#8216;For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A2" title="Romans 8:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 8:2)</span></a></span> And verses three and four say, <span class="scripture">&#8216;For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, [or by a sacrifice for sin] condemned sin in the flesh: That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A3-4" title="Romans 8:3-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 8:3-4)</span></a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Hence, it is evident that Christians are to live holy lives. God demands holiness of us. <span class="scripture">&#8216;Be ye holy; for I am holy,&#8217;</span> says <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+1%3A16">I&nbsp;Peter 1:16</a>. Yea, we are to repent and turn away from all sin, for Christ <span class="scripture">&#8216;gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+2%3A14" title="Titus 2:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Titus 2:14)</span></a></span> And <span class="scripture">&#8216;the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+2%3A11-12" title="Titus 2:11-12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Titus 2:11-12)</span></a></span>&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<p>The arrow of conviction shot deep down into many hearts as Robert Davis spoke these words. The truth he spoke commended itself to their minds and consciences. Some rebelled, and rejected his sound arguments. Peter Newby especially was agitated. He felt himself sinking into despair, as far as argument was concerned. Old Mr. Stephenson and Charley Moss trembled from head to foot. The Spirit of God was working powerfully in their and others&#8217; hearts.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not going to accept the interpretations placed upon this seventh chapter of Romans by the speaker,&#8221; said Peter, as he arose to reply. &#8220;Why? Because I never heard it explained that way. Why? Because I have heard Brother Peterson preach from these texts, and he has always declared a man could not keep from sin. Living free from sin! Whoever heard of such a thing? It can&#8217;t be done, that is all there is to it. We cannot keep from sin. Paul said sin was ever present with him, and I know it is with me. I try to do right, but sin gets the better of me. I ask God to forgive me every time I pray. I tell you, a man simply cannot live without committing sin.</p>

<p>When Peter Newby sat down, Robert Davis arose again, and said, &#8220;There is a text of scripture that says certain persons cannot cease from sin. I do not say that anyone here fulfills the description in that text. Peter says, in his Second Epistle, chapter two, verse 14: <span class="scripture">&#8216;Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+2%3A14" title="II&nbsp;Peter 2:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 2:14)</span></a></span> As I said, I charge no man with this kind of character, and only read it to give you a Scriptural description of one who cannot live without sin.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was painfully evident that this was an unwise thing to say at that particular time. Robert Davis was young, and full of zeal. Most probably he should not have uttered those words. Peter Newby was powerfully affected. He felt as if his character had been scandalized before the whole crowd. His face waxed red with an inner rage. His body quivered and shook with excitement. No one had ever seen him quite so exercised. He arose slowly, but with extreme determination. Things had gone as far as they could without a physical clash.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your place, young man, I will not allow anyone to insult me in this manner. Be careful what you say. There will be another chapter added to this if you are not careful. I will defend my honor, no matter what it costs.&#8221; And he resumed his seat.</p>

<p>The air was filled with intense excitement. A few words from Robert Davis would have struck fire, and he I knew it. So he quietly sat still without saying a word. The tenseness of the situation was painful. Just then Mary Davis started that old familiar song:</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Jesus, lover of my soul,<br />Let me to Thy bosom fly,<br />While the nearer waters roll,<br />While the tempest still is high.<br />Hide me, O my Savior, hide,<br />Till the storm of life is past;<br />Safe into the haven guide;<br />Oh, receive my soul at last.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few joined in toward the last half of the verse, and, as she began on the second verse, the whole congregation sang with vigor:</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Other refuge have I none,<br />Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;<br />Leave, ah! leave me not alone,<br />Still support and comfort me.<br />All my trust on Thee is stayed,<br />All my help from Thee I bring;<br />Cover my defenseless head<br />With the shadow of Thy wing.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Jesus_Lover_of_My_Soul/index.html" title="Jesus, Lover of My Soul">*</a></p>

<p>Robert and Mary Davis started for home as soon as they could. Peter Newby got into an argument with old Mr. Stephenson, who by this time had become a sort of champion of Robert&#8217;s, and a crowd encircled them. Peter Newby found a match in the old man, for Mr. Stephenson, at this time, while mentally convinced, was still unsaved, and could be as personal and ironical as Mr. Newby. They argued the point of a sinless life for an hour, mixed a good deal of personal invective into the argument, which drew from the crowd vociferous &#8220;ha! ha&#8217;s!&#8221; and they parted without feeling one whit better toward one another than they did before.</p>
