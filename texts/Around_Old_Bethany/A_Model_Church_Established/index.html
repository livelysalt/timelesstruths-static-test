<h1>A Model Church Established</h1>

<p>Jesus Christ brought the grandest conception of human brotherhood that the world has ever heard. He intended to create a perfect society, and to establish principles of social justice in the earth. He planned that sin, with its accompanying maladjustments, should be destroyed, and that man should live in harmony with man and with the infinite Creator. Nothing less than the transformation of society was His goal. His plan of rejuvenation was based on the truth that all men are of one blood, created by one God, whose children they all are by virtue of that creation. All should have equal claims upon His mercy, goodness, and love, and upon the material blessings which the earth affords. Divisions into rank, classes, and strata are not the will of God. Jesus put all on one common level when He invited all to come unto Him and rest, when He said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+6%3A37" title="John 6:37"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 6:37)</span></a></span></p>

<p>This work of reforming society goes on like yeast working in dough, particle by particle, a little at a time, but at an accelerating rate. At first there were the twelve apostles and a few others. By and by there were more. But always and ever Christ carries on His great work through His people. First one man is enlightened and saved; he then becomes a missionary to enlighten others. They in turn lead others to Jesus until there are enough to establish a congregation of the church of God at whatever point they live. This local congregation becomes then, a model in miniature of what society would be if all were Christians. Vast responsibilities rest upon a local congregation. They represent God. They show forth the power of God and exhibit to the world the blessed state of the saved. They are responsible to make their society attractive, so that sinners may be convicted of their lack and be persuaded to become members of it. The next several months of our narrative embraces the time when God raised up a church, a society of the saved, in Bethany.</p>

<p>One year after the &#8220;tongues&#8221; revival, Evangelist Monteith began the second revival of the church of God in Bethany. He was accompanied by three helpers. Robert Davis and Mary were sanctified wholly. So also was Jake Newby and Kate, old Mr. Stephenson and Charley Moss. Thirty-five were converted, and twelve besides the ones named were sanctified. Mrs. Thomas Jones was healed of tuberculosis and Dr. Horton, who had been her physician for three years, met her one day and was much surprised at her appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Mrs. Jones, whatever has happened to you?&#8221; he said. &#8220;You look so well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you heard about my healing, Doctor?&#8221; she replied pleasantly. &#8220;At the meeting recently the Lord touched my body with His healing power and I do not cough any more, the fever is gone, and I am gaining two pounds a week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My, if you folks keep on I will starve to death practicing medicine,&#8221; said the Doctor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably we shall not spend money for drugs, Doctor, but there will still be things you can do for us,&#8221; said Mrs. Jones. &#8220;We are still under physical laws and your knowledge will be of great help to us in keeping well.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the advertising matter which Robert Davis published at the beginning of the second revival he publicly repudiated Mormonism, Russell&#8217;s &#8220;No-hell-ism,&#8221; Adventism, and announced that the meeting was under the auspices of the church of God. The meeting itself was so sane, yet so spiritual, that it commended itself to everyone who attended. There were no excesses, and everything was done decently and in order.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the last day of the meeting, the evangelist preached on &#8220;The Church, the House of God,&#8221; and in the afternoon he preached on &#8220;The Church, its Divine Ordinances,&#8221; after which thirty-nine were baptized in the river which flowed close by. The minister stood on the banks and said: &#8220;We have met here this beautiful afternoon, friends, to administer the ordinance of baptism. Jesus commanded His ministers in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+28%3A19+and+20">Matthew 28:19 and 20</a>&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8216;Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.&#8217;</span> We gladly obey the commands of our great Redeemer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Baptism does not save the sinner, but it is the answer of a good conscience, as <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Peter+3%3A21">Peter 3:21</a> says. Baptism represents our death to sin and our resurrection to righteousness. As Paul, the great apostle says: <span class="scripture">&#8216;Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+2%3A12" title="Colossians 2:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 2:12)</span></a></span> The whole idea of baptism is beautifully pictured in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+6%3A3-4">Romans 6:3-4</a>, <span class="scripture">&#8216;Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.&#8217;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Once these dear ones were dead in sins, but through repentance and faith they now are saved. They are, therefore, fit subjects for baptism.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a very solemn occasion. A holy awe covered the crowd, a holy atmosphere was prevalent among the people. One by one the minister led the candidates down into the typical grave of water and when they arose out of the water there were praises and thanks given unto Him who had loved them and washed them from sin in His own blood. So affecting was this scene that three persons asked for prayer that they might be saved.</p>

<p>At 6:00 P.M. the ordinances of feet-washing and the Lord&#8217;s Supper were celebrated. When the congregation was assembled the minister said, &#8220;Jesus, on the night of His betrayal, ate the last Passover supper in the upper room with His disciples. Before this supper was ended He took a towel and washed the disciples&#8217; feet, and said: <span class="scripture">&#8216;If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet: ye also ought to wash one another&#8217;s feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done unto you&#8230;. If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+13%3A14-17" title="John 13:14-17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 13:14-17)</span></a></span> We shall follow Jesus in this ordinance. It symbolizes true Christian humility and service one to another. It symbolizes one of the most tender relationships one person can hold with another, that of mutual helpfulness in little things. A very deep lesson it teaches, one that has not been very well learned by Christians yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they separated, the men going to one place, the women to another, and participated in the blessed ordinance.</p>

<p>Afterward, they assembled for the Lord&#8217;s Supper in remembrance of Christ&#8217;s death for them.</p>

<p>The effects of this meeting on the people of the town were profound. Some wondered, some scoffed, some were deeply convicted, but many were stirred to the point of discussion and earnest Bible-searching to see if these things were so. Mr. Johnson, the bookstore man, sold more Bibles the next month after the revival than he had in the whole previous year.</p>

<p>The congregation raised up began at once to lay plans for a suitable church building. A lot was donated by one of the new converts, and many volunteered their services on the new building that was to be erected.</p>

<p>The zeal of the church led them to hold meetings in the neighborhood surroundings, one of which was held in the neighborhood of the Fairmount School, where the debates had taken place. Peter Newby had spent considerable time in Bible study since those debates, but what his conclusions were, no one knew. One Sunday the church announced an all-day meeting and basket dinner in a grove near Peter&#8217;s house. There were many present, but one person, whose eye glistened with the fire of energy, was conspicuous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, there is old Peter Newby,&#8221; said Mary to Robert, and they went over and greeted him cordially.</p>

<p>The evening was given over to a testimony and experience meeting. Many testified to full salvation. It was to the surprise of Robert and Mary Davis, as well as the others, when Peter Newby arose and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Friends, let me tell you something,&#8221; and he looked around in that same quizzical way and poised his head as he used to do. &#8220;I am convinced.&#8221; And he stopped again. Everybody listened most attentively. &#8220;I fought Bob Davis over there ever since he came into this neighborhood. I fought holiness. I fought divine healing. I fought the church of God. I really thought, friends, that the Bible said, &#8216;He that saith he liveth and sinneth not is a liar and the truth is not in him.&#8217; But I never found it.&#8221; And the old man stopped again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have watched this church of God come up in this neighborhood, and I must confess it has done more for this community than anything that has ever happened to it since I have been here. It has lifted up several of my neighbors out of sin. It has brought peace to many homes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry that I fought this work. God forgive me. I was wrong and I was stubborn. But I know now that if a man is a Christian he will not commit sin.</p>

<p>It was almost overwhelming to Robert and Mary Davis. Tears of joy flowed down their faces. They ran over to old Peter, grasped his arm, and said, &#8220;God bless you, Brother Newby, we knew you were honest at heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>That day Jake Newby recovered the confidence he used to have in his father.</p>

<p>These were the beginnings of the church at Bethany, the church of God. A church house was built and the church was organized by the Holy Spirit into a working body of saints. Robert Davis soon afterward felt the inspiration to teach and exhort and he was much used in this way. By and by he preached occasionally until his gifts were recognized by the church through the laying on of the hands of the ministry.</p>

<p>There was a true spirit of acceptance in this congregation which caused them to make all Christians feel at home there. They maintained unity by keeping close to God. Their Sunday school soon was the largest in the town. Three missionaries went from it to foreign, heathen lands, and colporteurs carried the literature of the church into every home in the town. The reputation of the church spread far and wide. It became noted for the honesty and humility of its members. The businessmen of the town had the utmost confidence in the church. It became the greatest power for righteousness in the town, and everyone came to look upon it as the living exponent of the best and highest in civic life and social uplift as well as in religion. Zion became a praise in the earth, as the prophet had said.</p>
