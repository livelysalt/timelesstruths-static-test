<h1>Robert Davis&#8217; Battles</h1>

<p>A month passed away rapidly. Robert and Mary Davis were making arrangements to occupy the property bought from Jake Newby. Ever since the little quarrel over the removal of the chicken house, Robert had not seen much of Jake. As for Jake, he continued sour and implacable. It was very hard for any Newby to receive instruction from anyone, and yet, when they were on the right side of anything they were bold champions for it. Some of the best improvements fostered by the community had been initiated by them. Nevertheless, Robert considered it best to avoid any further rupture of their relations.</p>

<p>Jake Newby felt keenly the outcome of the debates in the Fairmount School. He did not like to see his father suffer a loss of his prestige in the community. He nursed a secret grudge against Robert, and determined that if ever an opportunity presented itself to his liking, he would do something to humble him. He chafed especially under the implication that his father was not a Christian, and if only he could cause a downfall to Robert he would get sweet revenge.</p>

<p>Robert Davis was unaware of what was going on in Jake Newby&#8217;s mind. He had not counted on any bitterness over their little dispute.</p>

<p>A few days before Robert and Mary planned to move, Robert went over to their new home to mow the yard and clean up a little. Jake Newby saw him coming, and noticed that he was alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now is my time,&#8221; muttered Jake to himself. So he strode over to where Robert was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that I cannot have my chicken house, Robert Davis?&#8221; asked Jake threateningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jake, you know that the chicken house was not reserved in our contract,&#8221; said Robert.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a liar,&#8221; shouted Jake.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are mistaken, Jake,&#8221; said Robert calmly, but feeling a strong impulse to strike his opponent.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a liar, Davis, and you have insulted my father,&#8221; said Jake, at the same time shaking his finger close to Robert&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>Instantly, Robert&#8217;s powerful right arm shot a blow directly at Jake&#8217;s jaw. It caught him square on the chin, and Jake went sprawling over the lawn. Jake arose, thoroughly angry. He rushed at Robert like a demon, but Robert quickly stepped to one side and caught Jake with another blow. Jake then closed in on Robert and attempted to throw him down.</p>

<p>Over and across the lawn they surged, trampling under foot the shrubbery which Jake had planted to beautify the homestead. The men were about equally matched in size and strength, but Robert&#8217;s clearer brain and strategy were too much for his opponent.</p>

<p>At last they fell in a heap, with Jake on top, and he was raining blows upon Robert&#8217;s face in token of his victory, when all at once Robert gave a sudden turn and landed Jake underneath before Jake was aware of what was happening. But by this time Robert&#8217;s heart was talking to him about the fight, so he merely held Jake down until he gave up and promised to go home and not make trouble any more. Then he let him up.</p>

<p>Jake shook himself, and started home. Robert was so upset that he could not work. He sat down on the porch of the house and took a survey of the affair. He became so engrossed in his study that he did not hear the sound of falling footsteps, until they were close upon him. He looked up quickly, and met the scornful gaze of Peter Newby&#8217;s hazel eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you have become a fighting holiness man have you? You were so holy a short time ago that you could insult an old man like me with your insinuating remarks. Now, maybe you will believe me when I say that man can&#8217;t live without sinning,&#8221; said Peter disdainfully.</p>

<p>Robert was so completely whipped by his own conscience that he felt no inclination to defend himself. Indeed, how could he defend himself?</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, young man, you ought to drop this holiness stuff, for there is nothing In it&#8212;all bunk. Living above sin are you? Ha! ha! ha!&#8221; and the old man gave poor Robert an explosive horse laugh. &#8220;Goodbye, holy Robert,&#8221; said Peter, as he drove away.</p>

<p>Robert sat still on the porch. He began to wonder if this was the way he was going to dedicate his new home, and if he had destroyed his influence in the community. What would Mary think of him! Good, quiet, godly Mary, who had always looked up to him as the embodiment of noble and manly qualities. And Mary was cherishing a little one under her heart, and preparing to receive a priceless treasure. What kind of a father was he going to be, Robert asked himself. Shall I tell her, or shall I hide it? Swiftly the thoughts ran through his mind while big, cold drops of sweat stood out upon his forehead like beads of crystal. Never before had he felt so thoroughly miserable. In his youth, Robert had never been quarrelsome, but he had accepted challenges whenever they were made. Since his conversion, however, he had lived a consistent Christian life, and he had been very particular of his conduct since God had shown him light on holiness and sanctification.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will kneel down here and pray,&#8221; said Robert, out loud. This decision was his response to grim Despair, who had now put in his appearance with suggestions to give up all, go back into sin, quit professing, and be an open sinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why try it any longer?&#8221; said Despair. &#8220;You can never face your neighbors again. Give up. Give up. You have tried, and you have failed. You are a failure. Your reputation is gone. You can never live for Christ in this neighborhood. Get even with the Newbys.&#8221;</p>

<p>No sooner did Robert resolve, with holy determination, to defeat Despair and pray, than he got upon his knees. And there, at the doorway of his future home, he poured out his heart before Almighty God, and vowed he would not go back any farther than he was, and that he would strive, with all his heart, to do God&#8217;s will.</p>

<p>As the sun began to go down behind the hills to the west of him, Robert started home. Flecks of cloudlets began to redden, and the denser strata of clouds took on a deep purple, as the western sky blazed out in a marvel of beauty. And Robert thought, truly, that <span class="scripture">&#8220;The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+19%3A1" title="Psalm 19:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 19:1)</span></a></span>; why could not man glorify Him better?</p>

<p>Mary saw at once that Robert wore a troubled expression on his face. Robert saw that Mary sensed that something was wrong. As soon as he could, he went in and sat by Mary&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary, dear, I know that you will be ashamed of me, when I tell you what I have done,&#8221; said Robert.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, Robert, what have you done?&#8221; cried Mary, &#8220;you look so troubled and gloomy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary, I am sorry to tell you what I have done, but I will hide nothing and will tell you all about it,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You remember that chicken house we prevented Jake from moving that day? Well, he met me at the place today and called me a liar and said that I had insulted his father. Before I hardly knew what I was doing I hit Jake and we had a fight. I finally beat him, and he promised to behave. I felt just like giving up, Mary, and never trying to serve the Lord any more. But I promise you, dear, that I will not go back.&#8221; And great big tears of hearty contrition rolled down Robert&#8217;s face, and Mary, all tears herself, lovingly wiped his tears away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know if you can have confidence in me or not, Mary, after this, but I expect to rise above it, God helping me,&#8221; said Robert, when he could speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;I recognize that I have done wrong,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;What shall I do about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must forgive Jake, and Mr. Newby, too, Robert,&#8221; said Mary. &#8220;The Scriptures are plain: <span class="scripture">&#8216;But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your heavenly Father forgive your trespasses.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+6%3A15" title="Matthew 6:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 6:15)</span></a></span> Can you forgive them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, by God&#8217;s help, I forgive them. I do,&#8221; said Robert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Should you not also make confession to Jake Newby for fighting him?&#8221; asked Mary. &#8220;And then give him that chicken house if he still demands it. <span class="scripture">&#8216;Therefore, If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+12%3A20" title="Romans 12:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 12:20)</span></a></span> And to break the power of the grudge, why not obey <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+5%3A23-24">Matthew 5:23-24</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8216;Therefore, if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there remember that thy brother hath ought against thee; leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.&#8217;</span>&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Jake is not a brother, Mary,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;but the Scriptures point out the best way to recover. I feel so ashamed, Mary, after standing up for a holy life and then failing this way. But I feel that following the Word of truth will be the quickest way to recovery. It is my ambition to be an example of God&#8217;s keeping power. I wish to so live that holiness may be established as truth in this community. I want my life to tell for Jesus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert decided that the sooner he went the better it would be; so he drove to Jake&#8217;s house at once. Jake was greatly surprised to see Robert drive up and greeted him very surlily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jake, I have come over to ask your forgiveness for striking and fighting you this afternoon. I did wrong. Pardon me. I am sorry I gave way, Jake. And say, Jake, if you want that chicken house, just come and get it. It is too small for the number of chickens Mary intends to raise, anyway. You can have it, Jake, freely, gladly. What&#8217;s a chicken house between friends?</p>

<p>&#8220;The Lord made me feel very guilty over this affair, Jake,&#8221; continued Robert. &#8220;At first I thought I would give up entirely, but Jake, I cannot do that. The Lord has done too much for me and my wife, and&#8212;well, others are counting on me. I want to make everything right; so you will feel perfectly free to visit me any time you wish. Praise God! I feel better, Jake. Will you forgive me?&#8221; And Robert stretched out his hand toward Jake.</p>

<p>Jake took it, and there, in that happy twilight hour, a grudge and a sin were laid in a grave of oblivion, never to be resurrected.</p>
