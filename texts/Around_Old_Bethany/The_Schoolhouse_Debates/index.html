<h1>The Schoolhouse Debates</h1>

<p>Robert Davis did much studying between the two prayer meeting nights. Peter Newby searched through his old Bible at home for &#8220;he that saith he liveth and sinneth not is a liar,&#8221; but he could not find it. The nearest text he could find that was like it was <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1%3A8">I&nbsp;John 1:8</a>, and he knew that Robert Davis had already explained it. Peter studied hard, however. He found several texts, such as <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+20%3A9%3B+Matthew+19%3A16-17%3B+Romans+3%3A10%3B+1+Timothy+1%3A15%3B+Romans+7">Proverbs 20:9; Matthew 19:16-17; Romans 3:10; I&nbsp;Timothy 1:15; Romans 7</a>; and others, which he thought supported his theory that no one could live free from sin. He reckoned without taking his opponent into account, however, and came off worse confounded in the second encounter than he did in the first. <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+6">Romans 6</a> was rather hard on Peter&#8217;s theory, and he decided it would not pay him to say much about it.</p>

<p>The prayer meeting was well attended on that night. The air was full of expectancy. Peter&#8217;s long supremacy in debating caused several to wish secretly for him to be beaten; others took his side, and did all that they could to encourage him. A few were interested for truth&#8217;s sake. After the chapter was read, Peter Newby was first on his feet and began his diatribe.</p>

<p>&#8220;<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+6%3A4">Verse 4</a> means water baptism,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and if a man is not baptized he cannot be saved. We go down into the water a sinner, and come up a Christian. Some of you people have never been baptized, and yet you claim to be saved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, last prayer meeting night, I promised to find that old familiar text, &#8216;He that saith he liveth and sinneth not is a liar and the truth is not in him,&#8217; but I have not found it yet. But I will find it, mind you. Moreover, I have some texts that prove my contention that no one can live free from sin while in this life.</p>

<p>&#8220;<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+20%3A9">Proverbs 20:9</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8216;Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?&#8217;</span> This text can mean only one thing, which is that no one can be clean from sin.</p>

<p>&#8220;<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+19%3A16-17">Matthew 19:16-17</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8216;There is none good but one, that is God.&#8217;</span> Now, how can any man call himself good in the face of this scripture?</p>

<p>&#8220;Read <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+3%3A10">Romans 3:10</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8216;As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one.&#8217;</span> No, not one! Do you hear it? No, not one!&#8221; Peter shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Paul said that <span class="scripture">&#8216;Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+1%3A15" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 1:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 1:15)</span></a></span> And if Paul was the chief of sinners, do we think we can live free from sin? No, sir! we cannot. And in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+7">Romans 7</a> he declared that he was <span class="scripture">&#8220;carnal, sold under sin.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+7%3A14" title="Romans 7:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 7:14)</span></a></span> I tell you we cannot live better than Paul did. But I am a Christian, for I was baptized fifty years ago in the Big Sandy river, and the Scriptures say that he that <span class="scripture">&#8216;believeth and is baptized shall be saved.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+16%3A16" title="Mark 16:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 16:16)</span></a></span>&nbsp;&#8221; And Peter again resumed that air of triumph that made him famous throughout the community. Then he cast his eyes around the audience, and poised his head at various angles, in token of his victory.</p>

<p>&#8220;The brother has gone a long way from his text for his material tonight,&#8221; said Robert Davis. &#8220;He took what we boys used to call a &#8216;running jump.&#8217; The text he quoted from Proverbs proves nothing whatever against a holy life. No man can save himself, for salvation is by faith, not by works. But, again, let me remind Mr. Newby that Christ has come since Solomon spoke, and surely Christ has done something for us. The other texts he quoted are easily explained. In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+19%3A16-17">Matthew 19:16-17</a>, Jesus was stating a primary truth, as all goodness comes from God, yet, He was trying to impress upon the young man that He, Jesus, was God. No man is good in and of himself. God must come in before he is good. God&#8217;s people are righteous, good. John says, <span class="scripture">&#8216;He that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+3%3A7" title="I&nbsp;John 3:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 3:7)</span></a></span> Now, let us read <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+3%3A10">Romans 3:10</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8216;There is none righteous, no not one.&#8217;</span> I wish Mr. Newby would read the verses following the tenth verse. What kind of people was Paul writing of? Christians? What! Do Christians have a throat like an open sepulchre? Is their mouth full of cursing and bitterness? Are their feet swift to shed blood? How about it, Mr. Newby? How about it friends? What is your verdict?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That cannot mean Christians,&#8221; said a voice from the back of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, it cannot. Paul was describing the wayward sinner. As for Paul being actually the chief of sinners when he wrote <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+1%3A15">I&nbsp;Timothy 1:15</a>, it is preposterous. He does, indeed, speak in the present tense, &#8216;I am,&#8217; but it is perfectly evident that he makes use of a rhetorical expression which is permissible, without being called in question as to his life. If he was, in reality, the chief of sinners at that time, he could hardly say, as he did, <span class="scripture">&#8216;Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+2%3A10" title="I&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:10)</span></a></span> And it is entirely inconsistent to believe that the Christ would permit a chief sinner to be an ambassador for Him. Mr. Newby&#8217;s text in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+7%3A14">Romans 7:14</a> will come up for discussion next week; so I will not speak of it now.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you did not find your text, Mr. Newby. The five dollars is ready whenever you find it,&#8221; said Robert Davis, as he sat down.</p>

<p>All eyes were now upon Mr. Newby. Here was an opponent that was not to be stampeded or intimidated, one who knew his ground, and kept close to his texts. It was easy to see that Peter Newby was nonplussed. It usually had been easy for him to silence an opponent, or to get an expression of agreement, so that he smarted under the feeling that he was near to being defeated. His texts were gone. He had no more to offer, and he hardly dared to expound any of <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+6">Romans 6</a>, so there he sat, red in the face, his right hand pulling nervously at his stubby white mustache. It was either rise or admit defeat. So Peter Newby rose. His voice was cold and sinister.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not propose, friends, to be browbeaten by an upstart of a preacher. I tell you I have been a student of the Scriptures, and I have heard many learned ministers of the gospel preach, and I have never heard one of them state that they lived free from sin. I try to do my best every day, but, I tell you, the devil is strong, and the flesh is weak, so I often fall into grievous sins and errors. But I feel that I am a Christian, nevertheless. I have been baptized, and know that I believe.&#8221; And the old man sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we have not discussed our chapter very much,&#8221; said Robert. &#8220;Has any one any explanation to give?&#8221;</p>

<p>People glanced at Peter, but it was evident that he was about through for the evening.</p>

<p>Robert then rose, and said, &#8220;Friends, this sixth chapter of Romans is full of proof-texts favoring holiness of life. Paul asks, <span class="scripture">&#8216;Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+6%3A1" title="Romans 6:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 6:1)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8216;God forbid,&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+6%3A2" title="Romans 6:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 6:2)</span></a></span> he answers. And then Paul asks a most significant and conclusive question, <span class="scripture">&#8216;How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+6%3A2" title="Romans 6:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 6:2)</span></a></span> Mark the words, <span class="scripture">&#8216;dead to sin.&#8217;</span> What could Paul mean, except that we are to become dead to sin?</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, notice verse 6, please, <span class="scripture">&#8216;Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+6%3A6" title="Romans 6:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 6:6)</span></a></span> Crucifixion means death. The <span class="scripture">&#8216;old man,&#8217;</span> which means the old fleshly, sinful life, is to be killed, so that he may no longer dominate the life. Praise God!&#8221;</p>

<p>When Robert said these last words all in the house looked at him. They were not used to such expressions. Robert was a little surprised himself, as that was the first time he had ever said them. But his heart was full of heavenly joy. He knew God saved him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, shall we notice verse 16 and down to the twentieth? We necessarily must serve God or Satan; we yield our members, such as the tongue or the hands, to do evil, or to do good. And to whom we yield these members, his servants we are. This is fundamental. A person who does right serves God; one who sins serves the devil. Nothing can be plainer than this. Suppose we read <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+3%3A8">I&nbsp;John 3:8</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8216;He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.&#8217;</span> This is plain teaching, and it is entirely logical. Jesus said that no man can serve two masters. We cannot serve God and mammon at the same time.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, could anything be more emphatic than these words, <span class="scripture">&#8216;For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness?&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+6%3A20" title="Romans 6:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 6:20)</span></a></span> And these, <span class="scripture">&#8216;But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+6%3A22" title="Romans 6:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 6:22)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Peter Newby was plainly growing restive under these words of Robert&#8217;s. He rose and said, &#8220;I do not expect to sit here and be insulted by being called of the devil, and so forth. There are many wise men who have expounded the Scriptures, and they laid no claim to being saved from sin. There is a lot for this young man to learn yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this the meeting was dismissed. But there were little groups gathering here and there, talking about the debate. Peter Newby was rapidly losing his prestige. Most of the people took sides and enjoyed the conflict, while a few were interested in finding the truth.</p>
