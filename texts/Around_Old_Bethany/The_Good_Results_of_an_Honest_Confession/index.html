<h1>The Good Results of an Honest Confession</h1>

<p>The confession of Robert Davis to Jake Newby set Jake&#8217;s household all agog. They had never heard of such a thing before. When Jake had arrived home from his encounter he had told Kate, his wife, all about it, coloring it in his own favor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I went over to see Robert Davis and kindly asked him to let me have the chicken house and to reprove him gently for the way he had treated Dad, and, what do you think? He jumped on me as mad as he could be. I&#8217;ll get even with Bob Davis, I will. The mean rascal,&#8221; said Jake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of all things, is that the way holiness men do? A pretty mess for Davis to get into,&#8221; said Kate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix him. Wait till a good chance comes, and I will make him sorry enough,&#8221; said Jake. &#8220;Little good he can do in this neighborhood, living like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Jake, you are a member of the church, and you must be careful how you live,&#8221; said Kate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I suppose so,&#8221; said Jake laconically.</p>

<p>But Jake&#8217;s religion did not concern him very much. Everybody knew that. His name was on the church book, and Jake paid a little money in now and then, but as for prayer or testimony, he had none, and as for vital, personal godliness and personal salvation, to these he was a perfect stranger. In fact, the denomination to which Jake belonged did not believe in nor teach salvation from sin. Many others in it were just like him.</p>

<p>While the Newby family were discussing the fight, it was to their great surprise to see Robert Davis come through the open gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if there doesn&#8217;t come Bob Davis now,&#8221; Kate exclaimed. &#8220;What do you suppose he is after? Do you suppose he is going to renew the fight, Jake? Mercy me. Help!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Robert knocked quietly, and Jake opened the door, and before anyone else could speak Robert made his confession, while the Newby children and Kate looked on in amazement. After Jake and Robert shook hands, and the trouble was ended, a strange atmosphere pervaded the Newby home. They had never felt just like that before. There was a peace, an awe, a holy feeling such as people have sometimes at the height of a revival meeting. If Jesus had suddenly appeared in person there would not have been much more of a holy atmosphere than existed right there at that moment. They could hardly understand it. No doubt the angels of heaven were there, and the Holy Spirit was present to exert His benign influence toward the salvation of that family. Kate began to cry great big tears of joy. Jake sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jake, Bob Davis is a man,&#8221; said Kate. &#8220;That was the most open, honest confession I ever heard. I do not know of anyone who would do such as he has done. There must be something to his religion. You know the fight you had with Tom Sawyer, and he is a deacon in the First Church of Bethany. What came of it? Never a word of confession did he ever make. What kind of a man is Mr. Davis, anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something strange about Bob Davis,&#8221; said Jake. &#8220;Said I could have that old chicken house if I wanted. I&#8217;d be a fool to take it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jake, I believe Robert Davis is a real Christian,&#8221; said Kate, as a sort of confession on her part. &#8220;Why, I do not know of a member of our church that would do the manly thing that he has done, coming up without any self-justification and asking forgiveness for his wrong. I&#8217;m more convinced than I ever was before that Robert&#8217;s doctrine is right, after all. Your dad would not own up like that even if he knew he was in the wrong. I wish I had more of Robert&#8217;s religion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is true. Kate,&#8221; said Jake. &#8220;Dad&#8217;s either too hardheaded or has not enough religion to own up to a fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I begin to feel like I am not a Christian at all, Jake,&#8221; said Kate. &#8220;I could not do as Robert Davis has done. No, I couldn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m not much of a Christian. I believe we might as well quit our profession, Jake, if we can&#8217;t live better than we are.&#8221; And more big, honest tears rolled down Kate&#8217;s cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I have been baptized,&#8221; said Jake, and Pastor Sammons said water baptism was essential to salvation. I believed in Jesus Christ and was baptized. What else can I do? I live as good as any other member of our church. I have been in good standing for ten years. I do not know what else to do. The preacher thinks I am all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; replied Kate, &#8220;the preacher thinks I am all right, too, but <i>I</i> know I am not. I just feel that I am not a real Christian.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I must confess,&#8221; said Jake, &#8220;that Robert&#8217;s confession puts religion in a new light to me. With Robert religion is the main thing. He has family prayers night and morning; he is honest and scrupulous, and now when he sees he has done me a wrong he has come right over and made it right. I am not much of a Christian either, if that is Christianity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jake, what good is water baptism if our lives are not changed?&#8221; asked Kate. &#8220;I have just been thinking of the members of our church, and I am not trying to ignore their good qualities, but I do not know of more than two or three that I would ask to pray for me if I were going to die. They gossip, dress in all the latest fads, go to dances and theaters, rarely attend church, and are just like the worldly people around here who belong to no church. Is this Christianity? Why, Jake, when we had our bazaar, you remember, four of the sisters fell out and have not spoken to each other since. My, I never thought of these things before. I wonder what church Robert Davis belongs to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He calls it the church of God,&#8221; replied Jake.</p>

<p>&#8220;The church of God!&#8221; exclaimed Kate. &#8220;Why, what church is that? I never heard of it. But that name sounds good. If it is as good as its name it ought to be a good one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must confess,&#8221; said Jake, &#8220;that I never have enjoyed my religion. If it is the right kind it has done me very little good. But I can&#8217;t afford to drop it, for it&#8217;s all I have&#8212;at least till I see something better. Robert and Mary Davis seem to enjoy their religion. I always noticed that. I believe I shall investigate the church of God. What do you say to calling Robert and Mary over tomorrow night and talking all these things over with them? Robert seems to know a lot about the Bible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us do that,&#8221; said Kate.</p>

<p>Next morning Kate sent her son John to the Davis home with an invitation to come and spend the evening. They were surprised to get the invitation, but felt that it was their duty to go.</p>

<p>During that day both Jake and Kate were in a very humble mood. Peter Newby came over during the day and Jake told him all about Robert&#8217;s confession. Jake also expressed himself as being dissatisfied with his religion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, poof!&#8221; said Peter, &#8220;you are all right. Weren&#8217;t you baptized, and don&#8217;t you believe in Christ? Don&#8217;t give up your religion. Would you go back on your old dad and mammy like that? I hope I never see the day, Jake, when you will leave our church. Davis is no good.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Jake was so thoroughly awakened to his own sad state that his father&#8217;s speech affected him very little. In fact, it sounded hollow and hypocritical to him. Jake knew, down in his heart, that Robert had done the manly and Christian thing, and when he saw that his father did not appreciate what Robert had done, it made him feel that his father was not much of a Christian either. Jake lost confidence in his father right there.</p>

<p>Peter Newby sensed this change of attitude on Jake&#8217;s part, and it filled him with anger. Yet he knew that he dare not show it. But the fire in his bosom compelled him to speak out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jake, my son,&#8221; he said, trying hard to control his feelings, &#8220;I fear you are being shaken in the faith, but I hope if you are dissatisfied with our church that you will not disgrace the family by joining that holiness bunch. They are rotten. I know them of old. I would rather see you dead than for you to go with Bob Davis.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jake saw that there was little use to discuss the matter; so he desisted and turned the conversation to pigs. But Peter turned it back to religion.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you go along with that Davis,&#8221; Peter said, &#8220;I will disown you as my son, I will. After being a member of our church for ten years, then to own up that you are not a Christian&#8212;why, Jake, that will tear our church to pieces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But father,&#8221; said Jake, &#8220;suppose that I am not a real Christian, will it do me any good to continue to profess that I am? Is that not exactly what makes one a hypocrite? My soul longs for a real experience. I know I am not ready to die or fit to live either. I must get right with God.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peter Newby saw that it was useless to stay longer, so he rode away, feeling very angry at Jake for the mood he was in, and at himself for displaying such anger.</p>

<p>Robert and Mary Davis went to the Newbys&#8217; about nightfall and were given a cordial reception. After all was ready they all met in the parlor and discussed religion. A great many texts were read and talked over. Water baptism was investigated. Robert proved by the Scriptures that water baptism is not a saving ordinance.</p>

<p>&#8220;How could water baptism be a saving ordinance,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;when we know that water cannot have any effect, one way or another, upon a soul? And, if water baptism is essential to the obtaining of salvation, then two other things besides the blood of Jesus are necessary whenever a soul is saved. One is water, enough to be immersed in, according to your church doctrine, and the other is a man, or a preacher to baptize. Then, if one were out somewhere away from water and a preacher, he could not be saved. This will never do. It places too much in the hands of men. Peter makes it plain&#8212;read <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Peter+3%3A21">Peter 3:21</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220; <span class="scripture">&#8216;The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ,&#8217;</span>&nbsp;&#8221; read Kate Newby.</p>

<p>&#8220;This makes it plain,&#8221; said Robert. &#8220;Water cannot wash away sins except in a figurative way. It is the blood that cleanses. Read the last sentence of <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+1%3A5">Revelation 1:5</a>, and <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+1%3A14">Colossians 1:14</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220; <span class="scripture">&#8216;Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,&#8217;</span>&nbsp;&#8221; read Mary Davis. &#8220;This is Revelation 1:5. And Colossians 1:14 says, <span class="scripture">&#8216;In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.&#8217;</span>&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert, what church do you belong to?&#8221; asked Jake finally.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not a member of any denomination,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;but recently through a study of the Bible, I have become convinced that these denominations are not right, and that we should get back to the Bible in name, faith, and practice. I do not see any church that tallies with the church of the New Testament; so I am waiting and praying for God to establish a real New Testament church in this community. By the way, Jake, we found that the Bible name for the church is the church of God. We have had a religious paper coming to us, which is published in the interests of the church of God. Maybe this is what we are looking for. Jake, let us seek for the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will, Robert,&#8221; said Jake. &#8220;I am dissatisfied with my religion. Really, I doubt if ever I was converted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God bless you, Jake,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;the Lord has a real experience of salvation for you. Come to Him, repent, and believe. Get under the blood. Amen.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a blessed service of prayer and singing some of the good old soul-cheering songs, Robert and Mary Davis went home.</p>

<p>It was the beginning of a new era in the Jake Newby home.</p>
