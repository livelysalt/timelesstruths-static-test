<h1>Juan&#8217;s Birthday</h1>

<p>Today Juan was ten. He held up two hands and said, &#8220;Yo tengo diez años,&#8221; because he spoke Spanish. Diez. Ten.</p>

<p>That was a big boy age, Mamá said, and sent him to gather firewood. &#8220;Take Lucita,&#8221; she said. &#8220;She can ride on Coco.&#8221;</p>

<p>Juan dragged his brown feet down the path to where Coco, the gray donkey, was tied. He didn&#8217;t feel like working on his birthday. Papá didn&#8217;t have lots of money for presents, but he could have played or gone swimming.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Coco.&#8221; The clip-clop of hooves followed Juan all the way to the shed. Lucita was waiting with a red bundle. &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; Juan asked, as he slapped the pack on Coco.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something for lunch,&#8221; she said with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine, but let&#8217;s hurry.&#8221; And with that little, seven-year-old Lucita was lifted on the sturdy donkey back and they set off. Behind the hut a dirt path led between the growing cornfields and up a hillside dotted with trees. Here Juan dropped Coco&#8217;s rope.</p>

<p>The burro stood quietly while they scouted through the grass. &#8220;Too bad,&#8221; Juan said, when they found only five small sticks. But he had gathered wood there only last week, so it was to be expected. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go,&#8221; Juan said, and trudged farther up the hill.</p>

<p>Large rocks and the bumpy ground made hard climbing, but Juan was impatient. &#8220;Coco, you must hurry or we will never get done,&#8221; he said sharply. But the little burro only plodded. &#8220;Get off and walk, Lucita,&#8221; Juan said. &#8220;You are probably too heavy for him when it is so steep.&#8221; So Lucita walked behind, holding the red scarf tightly.</p>

<p>Finally the ground leveled and the trees got thicker. &#8220;Let&#8217;s hurry and fill the sacks,&#8221; said Juan. Coco waited while they piled the load on his back, a bit on this side, a bit on that side. Some of the long sticks Juan snapped in half. At last nothing more could be added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go,&#8221; Juan said. But Lucita sat on the ground, one small foot held in her lap. &#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; he asked, and felt grouchy because the sun was so high.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got a poke in my toe,&#8221; she said. It was a little scratch, nothing to matter about, Juan thought. But Lucita wouldn&#8217;t walk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, for I&#8217;m hungry and Coco surely can&#8217;t carry you,&#8221; he said. Lucita started to cry. Juan began to feel a bit sorry for what he had said, for she was probably just as tired as he. Coco was tired, too, for the little donkey&#8217;s head hung to the ground, and they were far from home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I can find a spring to cool your foot,&#8221; Juan said, remembering some green grass that he had seen not too far off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we can have our picnic,&#8221; Lucita said, brushing away her tears. &#8220;Water will go well with cheese and bread and mango.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mango?&#8221; said Juan. &#8220;Did Mamá really pack a mango?&#8221; And when they sat beside the rippling little brook with their hot feet in the water, Juan thought it was a happy birthday after all. He cut the sweet, orange fruit with his jackknife: a piece for Lucita, a piece for himself, and the sticky pit for Coco to chew on.</p>
