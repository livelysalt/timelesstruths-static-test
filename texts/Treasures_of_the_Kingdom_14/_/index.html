<h1>Good Boy and the Gumdrops</h1>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t because Daniel was hungry that he wanted those gumdrops. Great-Aunt Irma had served them dinner only an hour before, and Aunt Irma could certainly cook. No, it wasn&#8217;t because he didn&#8217;t feel full enough, but because he wanted what he couldn&#8217;t have. Daniel sat on the brown leather chair and wondered how each of the colorful drops in the candy dish would taste.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_14/gumdrops_sitting.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="342" /></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been nearly eight years since Annie married and I came out and saw you folks&#8230;&#8203;and, my! how your children have grown, Leah.&#8221; Daniel was tired of hearing Aunt Irma and Mom talk. Dad had gone to town with Chad and Uncle Frank, and how he wished he had escaped the little apartment then! His feet itched to kick and run the more he tried to keep them still.</p>

<p>Looking around the small living room, Daniel imagined he was in a space ship heading for Pluto. It seemed like the trip took forever. The second hand of the coo-coo clock on the wall ticked round and round, just like Aunt Irma&#8217;s voice. &#8220;Why, Danny was just walking then&#8212;I do remember how he got chocolate pudding all over his round, little face. He did so amuse us!&#8221; Her laugh was like a swinging dinner bell, or maybe more like a recording of &#8220;Jingle Bells&#8221; through the space ship&#8217;s crackling radio. Daniel&#8217;s lips twitched in a little smile and he stared at the gray tiles on the ceiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;You really must admit they are a flock of angels,&#8221; Aunt Irma said, peering through her glasses at his three sisters sitting politely on the couch. Daniel glanced at his mother and saw her open her mouth to speak, but the clicking voice continued. &#8220;And I can&#8217;t believe this is little Danny all grown up. My, my! What <i>sweet</i> children; they are all so well-behaved! You know Mark and Annie&#8217;s boy? Well, he&#8217;s become quite a little tyrant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel exchanged an amused grin with Rosie. She was stitching on her sampler and Irene was cutting out paper dolls for Emma. He envied them&#8212;why hadn&#8217;t Mom let him bring his book in to read? How much longer would they have to keep talking? He eyed the gumdrops again.</p>

<p>Mom had said they shouldn&#8217;t have any candy when Aunt Irma had offered it after dinner. Why did she have to say that, especially when it was his favorite kind? The little glass dish was piled high with sugar-coated drops of red, orange, green and yellow. It was the round, orange ones that he wanted most of all. He could count five of them from where he sat.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be awhile before the men get back,&#8221; Mom said. &#8220;Do you mind if I put Kyle down for his nap?&#8221; She had been rocking him so long that Daniel could see he was nearly asleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course&#8212;I suppose he wouldn&#8217;t fall off the guest bed? Come along to the bedroom and I&#8217;ll get a quilt.&#8221; In short, quick steps Aunt Irma led the way down the hall. Daniel watched them disappear into a bedroom and then glanced at his sisters. They were murmuring about something in a picture album and didn&#8217;t look up.</p>

<p>Daniel could easily reach the candy bowl sitting on the lamp-stand. Quietly he picked out three orange gumdrops and slipped them into his pocket. He&#8217;d have to wait until later to eat them&#8212;later when he was alone and the others wouldn&#8217;t see. Daniel was sitting up straight and looking at a tourist guide when Aunt Irma and Mom returned a few minutes later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Children, would you like to go down to the park together?&#8221; Mom suggested. &#8220;Aunt Irma said that there is one only a few blocks away and it would be nice for you to run around a little. Just don&#8217;t ruin your good clothes.&#8221; Irene got the directions, and soon they were on their way.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_14/gumdrops_tree.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="285" /></div>
<p>It was a bother to wait for Emma&#8217;s short steps, so Daniel dashed on ahead until he came to the corner of the block. <i>Ha! I&#8217;ll hide in the hedge and scare them when they came up,</i> he thought. Sitting down in a little hollow, Daniel pulled out a gumdrop and popped it into his mouth. It tasted even better than he imagined, and so he ate the other two as well. <i>The girls are such slowpokes, not even halfway down the street yet,</i> Daniel murmured with disgust as he peeked out of his hiding place. <i>Ah, there&#8217;s an idea! If I climb up that little tree I can pretend I&#8217;m a cougar and jump on them.</i></p>

<p>It was when he had stepped on the second branch that Daniel realized he had made a mistake. With a low <i>creak</i> the branch snapped and in less than a second he found himself on the ground, with a scraped arm and grass-stains on both knees. The little tree fared worse: the lowest branch was hanging from a few splintered pieces of wood. Daniel scrambled to his feet and scooted back into the hedge.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>The park was small and shady with a swing set, but Daniel&#8217;s knees were sore and his arm hurt. He sat down on a bench near a goldfish pond. &#8220;Come on, Daniel!&#8221; Rosie called from a swing. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go on the teeter-totter together.&#8221; Daniel didn&#8217;t want to do that either. Irene would see the grass-stains and Rosie would want to know what happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to right now,&#8221; he said loudly. Then he looked up to see an elderly man approaching the pool. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll come in a few minutes,&#8221; he finished quickly, and pretended to be watching the fish intently. The man stopped beside him and Daniel got up, looking around to see where the girls were.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for the seat,&#8221; the man said in a friendly voice. &#8220;You seem to be a good, well-behaved boy. Do you live around here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No-o, we&#8217;re visiting some relatives,&#8221; Daniel said hesitantly. He turned to leave, but the man continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you must be having fun, from the looks of those knees.&#8221; The man chuckled. &#8220;I suppose those are your sisters over there? You hardly see such nicely dressed girls these days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uh-hmm,&#8221; Daniel murmured, and made his escape. If Irene <i>did</i> notice his pants, he&#8217;d just say he&#8217;d fallen down. No need to tell how it had happened.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear child, what a nasty scrape!&#8221; Aunt Irma exclaimed, when Daniel told Mother about falling down. &#8220;You&#8217;re such a brave good boy. I&#8217;ll look in the Band-Aid box for something to put on it.&#8221; Mom didn&#8217;t seem so impressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daniel, please change your pants so</p>

<p>that those can be cleaned. I&#8217;ll get the stain-remover and a scrub</p>

<p>brush for you to use.&#8221; Daniel felt like protesting: he had overheard Uncle Frank talk about taking a hike down to the lake before supper; but Aunt Irma was returning. If he complained she would probably lose her good opinion of him.</p>

<p>But Daniel knew he wasn&#8217;t the good boy he pretended to be. As he stood by the bathroom sink rubbing the stubborn stains, he grumbled to himself. <i>Why can the others be so good and I get into all the trouble?</i> Deep down he knew why&#8212;he had disobeyed, and acting like a &#8220;good boy&#8221; wasn&#8217;t good enough.</p>

<h1>Good Outside or In?</h1>

<p>Is Daniel a good boy like Aunt Irma thinks he is? It seems to me that he has some serious heart problems. What shall we call them? The disease of disobedience? In the story we can see what Daniel is really like inside, and he surely has a bad attitude. The Bible says that it is our heart that needs to be good, not the outside of us. We can act very polite and kind on the outside, but if our heart is angry and disobedient, we are not good at all. We have a heart problem and we need Jesus to change us.</p>

<p>God knows the thoughts we think and the things we do, when no one else does. He sees when we do wrong, and when we do right, and when we are just pretending to be good. The Lord wants us to have good hearts, inside where it counts. Jesus says the first commandment is to love God with all our heart. Can we do that if our heart is bad? We need pure, good hearts to see God and go to heaven. Pretending to be good will not fool God. But God is good and loves us, so He talks to our hearts and shows us that we are wrong, and that we need Him. We can not be truly good without God.</p>

<p>Was Jesus good? Or did He just pretend to be good and fool people? No, Jesus&#8217; heart was pure and good because He did nothing wrong. If we did nothing wrong, our hearts would be good, too. But sin makes our hearts bad, so Jesus came to deliver us from sin and make our hearts clean. Jesus did everything right because He loved and obeyed God. He asked God to help Him be good all the time. Do you want to be like Jesus?</p>

<p>We can&#8217;t be good from just trying. That is like washing the outside of a dirty cup. If people don&#8217;t look inside, they might think it looks clean. But would you want to drink out of it? We can put on our best behavior and smile and say &#8220;thank you,&#8221; but we can&#8217;t reach down into our hearts and fix the naughty thoughts and selfishness we have. Jesus has to do that. And Jesus is able to do that because He loves you and paid the price for you to have a heart-surgery. Do you want to be cured of your heart disease? Do you want to have God&#8217;s goodness?</p>

<h1>The Bearing-Up Burro: Longsuffering</h1>

<p>Have you seen this animal friend before? It has tall fuzzy ears, a stiff mane and is about the size of a pony. Did you guess the donkey? In some places these working animals are called <i>burros</i>, and they are used to carry packs or pull carts. You remember their &#8220;hee-haw!&#8221; but I will tell you how they &#8220;bear-up&#8221; so well.</p>

<p>Clippity, clip-clop. The little gray burro comes to sniff your hand for salt, then waits for a scratch on the head. He is a very gentle animal, even with small children, and will let you crawl on his back for a ride. Little brother pulls his paint-brush tail, but he won&#8217;t kick or stomp. He just lowers his head and nibbles at the grass while the girls make a daisy chain to hang around his neck. How very patient he is&#8212;just the kind of animal that gets along with everyone.</p>

<p>But playtime is not the only time our donkey friend bears up patiently. In many countries of the world the burro has work to do. Maybe it is some vegetables to sell at the market, or a load of sticks to take home, or even a child who needs a ride. Though he is little, the burro has a strong back and can be very helpful. When the work is hard and tiring do you think he will give up? No! He is willing and not selfish, so he can bear many things.</p>

<p>Bearing-up means to do things that are hard in a willing and cheerful way. When we have the attitude of the burro, we can love others even when things don&#8217;t go our way. It is the kind of love that God has toward us, called <i>longsuffering</i>. If you don&#8217;t feel well, or others are unkind, or things don&#8217;t go well, you can still be kind and gentle. Even if it you have to bear it for a <i>loooong</i> time. How can you do that? Ask God for His love, and He will help you.</p>

<p>Just think how the Lord bears up with us! When you say, &#8220;I wish I didn&#8217;t have such a mean brother!&#8221; God looks down and gently says, &#8220;If you take it rightly, he will be a blessing to you.&#8221; Many times we are unthankful and complain, forgetting how patient and kind God is. Don&#8217;t you think He would be angry? But He is so gentle and good. God wants us to be loving and kind all the time, and to do the hard jobs with a willing spirit, like the burro.</p>

<h1>Project, poem, and verse</h1>

<hr />
<h2>Make a Bearing-Up Burro</h2>
<p>You will need for the donkey:</p>

<ul>
<li>a donkey front and back cut out of stiff paper</li>

<li>a toilet paper tube 3&#8221; long</li>

</ul>
<p>Other supplies:</p>

<ul>
<li>a piece of cloth 8&#8221; x 2-1/2&#8221;</li>

<li>a stapler and glue</li>

</ul>
<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_14/gems_burro.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="244" /></div>
<p>Put the donkey together like this:</p>

<p>Make his pack by folding each end of the fabric up 1-1/2&#8221; and stapling them on the sides to make pockets. Put the pack on your burro&#8217;s back, and put the paper in the pockets.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas of how to use your burro:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep him on the table for &#8220;thank you&#8221; notes</li>

<li>In one pocket put papers that tell Hard Things for Me. In the other pocket put verses of how Jesus Can Help. Jesus always has help for us to bear our troubles!</li>

<li>Keep his packs full of God&#8217;s promises or your memory verses.</li>

<p>&#8220;Grandpa?&#8221; Edward had listened to adults read a scary news story. &#8220;Do you think <i>we</i> will be taken away someday, and Mom and Dad put in jail?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We never know,&#8221; Grandpa said, thoughtfully, &#8220;but always remember that God will help you if you are true to Him. Let me tell you a story&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

<h1>The Boy That Was True</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Daniel+1">Daniel 1</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">He lived far away in the land of Judah, a hilly dry land with farms and orchards, villages, and walled cities. And he was raised to know God and love His ways, even when many other people did not. Daniel was different. Many other boys cheated in their lessons, fought, and broke the rules, but Daniel always tried to do his best. He was often at the head of the class because he studied hard. Most of all, Daniel prayed.</p>

<p>Then his home city, Jerusalem, was besieged by the Babylonians. Enemies had often camped around the high walls and battered them, but this time the Lord let them capture the city! The king of Judah had been living very wickedly and many people had turned from God. Now he and many of the temple vessels were taken captive. It was a scary time for Daniel and his family, but they trusted in God. They waited to see what the king of Babylon would do.</p>

<p>Then it came&#8212;a summons to appear before the king for questioning. Do you think that Daniel was a bit frightened to leave his family? He might never return. Daniel and the other boys were tested for strength and understanding by important officers, and the best were chosen. Daniel was one of them. Maybe he wished that he hadn&#8217;t studied so hard now! But he still prayed, and asked God to help him be true. Even in far away Babylon.</p>

<p>God did help Daniel, because he chose to do the right thing always. One time he was asked to do something he knew would be wrong. The officer in charge was angry at him for not obeying, but Daniel only said, &#8220;Please prove us ten days.&#8221; He knew God would help him, and the other boys who wanted to do right. And the Lord made the officer like them and treat them well.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure Daniel got lonely for his family and home, as he studied a new language in a strange land. Every day he prayed and did his best. And because he was true to God, God was his Friend. Even as a captive Daniel learned to serve God and help others. And because the boy Daniel trusted in God, one day he was appointed top ruler in the land.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Alice and Sammy had come in to listen as Grandpa told the story that they knew so well. &#8220;I never thought of it that way,&#8221; said Alice, as he finished speaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>was</i> sort of like the newspaper story,&#8221; said Edward, &#8220;because Daniel was taken away from his family when they were trying to obey God and everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Grandpa. &#8220;We often have to suffer for what other people do. Daniel was taken captive because other people had lived wickedly, even though he did right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it the story about the children who were home schooled?&#8221; Alice asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;What story?&#8221; said Sammy.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were a family trying to do right, and other people who didn&#8217;t like them turned them in as law-breakers,&#8221; Grandpa said. &#8220;But what matters most? To live so other people will like us, or so God will be pleased?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God,&#8221; said Sammy solemnly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard when others laugh or think I&#8217;m stupid,&#8221; said Edward, looking down.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that is how Jesus was treated, too,&#8221; put in Alice. &#8220;I guess many people didn&#8217;t like Him either, and He <i>always</i> did right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and now He reigns in heaven.&#8221; Grandpa smiled. &#8220;It was worth it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Family vacation is here and you can&#8217;t wait! But stop. Are you going to have a fun time by doing whatever you want, or what Jesus wants you to do?</p>

<h1>The Choice is Yours</h1>

<h3><a name="1"></a>#1. &#8220;We&#8217;re planning on a 3-day camping trip,&#8221; Dad says. &#8220;But we have two places to choose from.&#8221;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Willow Lake is closer, but more expensive. <a href="#8">Go to #8</a>.</li>

<li>Black Bear Creek is more rugged and not as convenient. <a href="#11">Go to #11</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="2"></a>#2. Mom calls you carry the sleeping bags, and then the tents have to be set up. You haven&#8217;t even touched the water yet!</h3>
<ul>
<li>You pray to help cheerfully, then ask about the plans. <a href="#19">Go to #19</a>.</li>

<li>You dawdle and try to get out of the work. <a href="#14">Go to #14</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="3"></a>#3. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to hear bickering,&#8221; Dad says. &#8220;This is not getting us to a happy start.&#8221; You must sit beside Baby, and the trip begins.</h3>
<ul>
<li>You&#8217;re sorry for fussing. <a href="#22">Go to #22</a>.</li>

<li>You&#8217;re grouchy. <a href="#14">Go to #14</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="4"></a>#4. Dad hears your calls and rescues you, but you can&#8217;t play by yourself anymore. Jen and you fish from the shore and get 3 bass for lunch. <a href="#32">Go to #32</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="5"></a>#5. The ride to Willow Lake doesn&#8217;t take long, and you&#8217;re glad to find a site near the water.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Yelling, you scramble out. <a href="#2">Go to #2</a>.</li>

<li>You help to unload. <a href="#19">Go to #19</a>.</li>

</ul>
<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_14/choice_dog.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="196" /></div>
<h3><a name="6"></a>#6. The dog waits outside in the early morning light. He barks and leads you to a steep trail. <a href="#30">Go to #30</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="7"></a>#7. Everyone starts planning how to have a good time. With a raft and fishing supplies, all is ready. Wait! Bobby wants his sailboat.</h3>
<ul>
<li>You grin as he fits it in. <a href="#5">Go to #5</a>.</li>

<li>&#8220;It&#8217;s too squishy now,&#8221; you complain. <a href="#3">Go to #3</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="8"></a>#8. Mom and Jen like the idea, too. But Bobby thinks it will be boring. You say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so selfish!&#8221; <a href="#3">Go to #3</a>.</li>

<li>&#8220;We can make it fun.&#8221; <a href="#7">Go to #7</a>.</li>

<li>&#8220;Let Dad decide.&#8221; <a href="#13">Go to #13</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="9"></a>#9. &#8220;One question at a time!&#8221; Dad says, &#8220;but be ready for a long drive.&#8221; You sit beside Bobby, with the dog by the window.</h3>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Bobby&#8217;s hogging all the room!&#8221; you say. <a href="#3">Go to #3</a>.</li>

<li>You&#8217;re warm and fall asleep leaning on the dog. <a href="#20">Go to #20</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="10"></a>#10. It&#8217;s morning and you&#8217;re in a tent! How will you start the day?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pray for help. <a href="#17">Go to #17</a>.</li>

<li>You hop outside to see the day. If at the creek, <a href="#6">go to #6</a>. At the lake, <a href="#27">go to #27</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="11"></a>#11. Bobby looks eagerly at the map. Mom asks, &#8220;Will it be too far away?&#8221; You say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be quiet in the car.&#8221; <a href="#26">Go to #26</a>.</li>

<li>&#8220;What can we do there?&#8221; <a href="#9">Go to #9</a>.</li>

</ul>
<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_14/choice_raft.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="98" /></div>
<h3><a name="12"></a>#12. By the last bit of strength you get on the bank. You feel sick, and have to rest in the tent while the others have fun. THE END</h3>
<h3><a name="13"></a>#13. Dad decides Black Bear Creek will be a better choice. <a href="#11">Go to #11</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="14"></a>#14. Your bad attitude doesn&#8217;t help anything&#8212;and the tent floor feels hard that night. <a href="#10">Go to #10</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="15"></a>#15. There are tall trees and many birds to see. With a lovely picnic in a meadow, the hike is great. You get back in time for some chili and cookies. THE END</h3>
<h3><a name="16"></a>#16. &#8220;Want to see the sunrise?&#8221; Dad says. You sit on a log, enjoying the view until breakfast.</h3>
<ul>
<li>You play with Baby. <a href="#24">Go to #24</a>.</li>

<li>You slip off to the shore. <a href="#27">Go to #27</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="17"></a>#17. With a smile, you get up to help with breakfast.</h3>
<ul>
<li>If at the lake, <a href="#24">go to #24</a>.</li>

<li>If at the creek, <a href="#29">go to #29</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="18"></a>#18. Sputtering from the spray, you try baling water. The raft sinks, so you jump out.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start swimming to shore. <a href="#12">Go to #12</a>.</li>

<li>Hold onto the raft. <a href="#4">Go to #4</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="19"></a>#19. &#8220;How about blowing up the raft?&#8221; Dad suggests. Soon your toes are trailing in the clear cold water while Jen paddles. <a href="#22">Go to #22</a>.</h3>
<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_14/choice_sign.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="360" /></div>
<h3><a name="20"></a>#20. You stop by a forest trail marked, &#8220;Black Bear Creek&#8212;no fires permitted.&#8221;</h3>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; you say. <a href="#25">Go to #25</a>.</li>

<li>You and the dog set out to explore. <a href="#30">Go to #30</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="21"></a>#21. Snarling, the raccoon starts snapping, and both you and the dog get scratched up trying to get away. You get bandages and camp confinement. THE END</h3>
<h3><a name="22"></a>#22. <i>Camping is wonderful!</i> you think as you sing and drink hot cocoa that night. It&#8217;s not even dark when Dad says, &#8220;Bag-time for children.&#8221; You say:</h3>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Not yet, Daddy!&#8221; <a href="#14">Go to #14</a>.</li>

<li>&#8220;Wake me up early, please.&#8221; <a href="#31">Go to #31</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="23"></a>#23. You follow a deer path to a meadow, and then climb some rocks. Looking around, you can see a tent, but it&#8217;s not yours. <a href="#28">Go to #28</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="24"></a>#24. Later Dad, Jen, and you go on a raft ride and watch Bobby sail his boat. After lunch you go wading and find a turtle. <a href="#32">Go to #32</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="25"></a>#25. Mom pulls out the propane stove. Bobby points out a good site and everything is soon set up. It is late, so you go to bed after supper. <a href="#10">Go to #10</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="26"></a>#26. Soon you&#8217;re snuggled down with a backpack, hiking clothes, books, and the dog. It&#8217;s crowded and tiring, but at last the bumpy ride ends. <a href="#20">Go to #20</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="27"></a>#27. The raft is floating on the lake, but it is low on air. You push out anyway, heading for a jutting rock. An outboard motor whooshes by and water pours in. <a href="#18">Go to #18</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="28"></a>#28. The dog runs up to a short lady. She sends you back to your camp, and Mom keeps you near the rest of the time. THE END</h3>
<h3><a name="29"></a>#29. Dad is planning on a 2-mile hike with Bobby and you. The dog joins up, and you start off with a picnic lunch. <a href="#15">Go to #15</a>.</h3>
<h3><a name="30"></a>#30. As you slip down a steep bank, you see that the dog has found a raccoon by a small pool.</h3>
<ul>
<li>You call the dog and head around the pool. <a href="#23">Go to #23</a>.</li>

<li>You hurry to get Dad. <a href="#29">Go to #29</a>.</li>

<li>You get a stick and join the fight, trying to scare it. <a href="#21">Go to #21</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="31"></a>#31. It is still dark when there&#8217;s a scratching at the tent.</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re at the lake, <a href="#16">go to #16</a></li>

<li>If you&#8217;re at the creek, <a href="#6">go to #6</a></li>

</ul>
<h3><a name="32"></a>#32. That night you play campfire games. What fun this trip has been! THE END</h3>

<h2>Something You Can Do</h2>
<p>Here is a yummy recipe that has a taste of Mexico, the land where Juan lived (see the <a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_14/Juans_Birthday/index.html">next story</a>). You must begin your cooking the night before, because beans must be soaked and cooked a long time. Because you will get to practice being patient and &#8220;bearing-up,&#8221; let us call them</p>

<h1>Burro Burritos</h1>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>dry pinto beans</li>

<li>salt</li>

<li>flour tortillas (say <b>tor-TEE-yuz</b>)</li>

</ul>
<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_14/something_toppings.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="163" /></div>
<p>Toppings:</p>

<ul>
<li>lettuce or sprouts (yummy and fun to make!)</li>

<li>chopped tomatoes</li>

<li>sliced olives</li>

<li>grated cheese</li>

<li>cooked meat</li>

<li>hot sauce</li>

</ul>
<p>Equipment:</p>

<ul>
<li>pot</li>

<li>potato masher <i>or</i> electric blender</li>

<li>several small bowls</li>

<li>a large, greased skillet</li>

<li>a pancake turner</li>

<li>a dishtowel</li>

</ul>
<p>Follow these directions carefully, and ask before you use the stove.</p>

<ol>
<li>The night before, <b>measure</b> the beans and put them into the pot. Cover them with water to <b>soak</b>. For each person you need 1/3 cup dry beans and 1 cup water.</li>

<li>The next day <b>drain</b> off the water and <b>add</b> hot water, half the amount you used before. Set the pot on a burner on medium heat until the water begins to bubble. Let it <b>bubble</b> softly for 2 hours. Stir once in a while and add extra water if the beans start to get dry.</li>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_14/something_tortilla.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="123" /></div>
<li>Now carefully spoon out a bean and blow on it. Sprinkle on some salt and taste. If it is <b>soft</b> it is done. If it is crunchy, turn up the heat a little and cook longer.</li>

<li>Add <b>salt</b> until it tastes right, about a heaping 1/4 teaspoon per person.</li>

<li>It is time to <b>mash</b> the beans! Turn off the heat and scoop out most of the bean juice (save it to eat with rice or for soup). Mash the beans with the potato masher, or ask an older person to blend them for you. They should be thick and <b>creamy</b> when they are ready.</li>

<li>Next get the <b>tortillas</b> ready. Heat the skillet on medium heat. <b>Warm</b> the tortillas one at a time. When it starts to get hot and <b>soft</b>, flip it over with a pancake turner to warm the other side. Be careful not to burn it! Put the warm tortillas in a <b>dishtowel</b> while you heat the rest.</li>

<li>Fix the <b>toppings</b> that you will want and put them in the bowls.</li>

<li>Now we will make the burritos. <b>Lay</b> a warm tortilla on the counter. Carefully <b>spread</b> one large scoop of mashed beans down the middle. Sprinkle on the toppings and fold over the end like this: Finally, <b>fold</b> over the sides and put on a plate to <b>eat</b>. <i>Delicioso!</i></li>

<h1>Juan&#8217;s Birthday</h1>

<p>Today Juan was ten. He held up two hands and said, &#8220;Yo tengo diez años,&#8221; because he spoke Spanish. Diez. Ten.</p>

<p>That was a big boy age, Mamá said, and sent him to gather firewood. &#8220;Take Lucita,&#8221; she said. &#8220;She can ride on Coco.&#8221;</p>

<p>Juan dragged his brown feet down the path to where Coco, the gray donkey, was tied. He didn&#8217;t feel like working on his birthday. Papá didn&#8217;t have lots of money for presents, but he could have played or gone swimming.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Coco.&#8221; The clip-clop of hooves followed Juan all the way to the shed. Lucita was waiting with a red bundle. &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; Juan asked, as he slapped the pack on Coco.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something for lunch,&#8221; she said with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine, but let&#8217;s hurry.&#8221; And with that little, seven-year-old Lucita was lifted on the sturdy donkey back and they set off. Behind the hut a dirt path led between the growing cornfields and up a hillside dotted with trees. Here Juan dropped Coco&#8217;s rope.</p>

<p>The burro stood quietly while they scouted through the grass. &#8220;Too bad,&#8221; Juan said, when they found only five small sticks. But he had gathered wood there only last week, so it was to be expected. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go,&#8221; Juan said, and trudged farther up the hill.</p>

<p>Large rocks and the bumpy ground made hard climbing, but Juan was impatient. &#8220;Coco, you must hurry or we will never get done,&#8221; he said sharply. But the little burro only plodded. &#8220;Get off and walk, Lucita,&#8221; Juan said. &#8220;You are probably too heavy for him when it is so steep.&#8221; So Lucita walked behind, holding the red scarf tightly.</p>

<p>Finally the ground leveled and the trees got thicker. &#8220;Let&#8217;s hurry and fill the sacks,&#8221; said Juan. Coco waited while they piled the load on his back, a bit on this side, a bit on that side. Some of the long sticks Juan snapped in half. At last nothing more could be added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go,&#8221; Juan said. But Lucita sat on the ground, one small foot held in her lap. &#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; he asked, and felt grouchy because the sun was so high.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got a poke in my toe,&#8221; she said. It was a little scratch, nothing to matter about, Juan thought. But Lucita wouldn&#8217;t walk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, for I&#8217;m hungry and Coco surely can&#8217;t carry you,&#8221; he said. Lucita started to cry. Juan began to feel a bit sorry for what he had said, for she was probably just as tired as he. Coco was tired, too, for the little donkey&#8217;s head hung to the ground, and they were far from home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I can find a spring to cool your foot,&#8221; Juan said, remembering some green grass that he had seen not too far off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we can have our picnic,&#8221; Lucita said, brushing away her tears. &#8220;Water will go well with cheese and bread and mango.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mango?&#8221; said Juan. &#8220;Did Mamá really pack a mango?&#8221; And when they sat beside the rippling little brook with their hot feet in the water, Juan thought it was a happy birthday after all. He cut the sweet, orange fruit with his jackknife: a piece for Lucita, a piece for himself, and the sticky pit for Coco to chew on.</p>

<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_14/Love_and_Hate/index.html">Love and Hate</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Love and Hate</h1>

<p>Billy looked up with a start. There was a big group of boys across the playground, and they were all yelling. They were at it again!</p>

<p>Where was Mrs. Johnson, the teacher? Everybody was jumping on Hank again. He was fighting hard, but it was hard to even see him. A big bunch of boys were all over him. There were so many of them that they couldn&#8217;t even all get at Hank because they got in each others way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop it!&#8221; Billy hollered. He ran into the crowd of fighting boys and began to pull them off of Hank. It wasn&#8217;t fair! All of those boys against one boy! Besides, people shouldn&#8217;t fight&#8212;they should love one another.</p>

<p>Bam! A fist hit Billy in the face. &#8220;Ow!&#8221; He was trying to pull a boy off of Hank when another boy, Jim, kicked him in the stomach. It hurt. Then Ronald tried to slug Hank in the ear, but Billy got in the way. For a moment, Billy saw stars. Ronald looked as if he wanted to hit Hank some more, but Billy was there, so Ronald quit. The other boys began to quit as well.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_14/love_boy.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="387" /></div>
<p>Finally, there was just Billy and Hank. Hank was lying on his stomach, but he started getting up. Billy smiled at him and reached out a hand to help him up.</p>

<p>It was then that Hank hit him! He hit him on the shoulder, hard enough to hurt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hank!&#8221; Billy said, &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to help you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hank hit him again. This time it was in the stomach. It hurt a lot and Billy could hardly breathe. He couldn&#8217;t say anything. Hank swung at his nose, and Billy ducked. Hank kicked him. Then he grabbed his left arm and twisted it behind his back. &#8220;Ow!&#8221; Billy hollered.</p>

<p>At that point Mrs. Johnson arrived. The principal, Mr. Jakowski, was there, too. Soon Billy was sitting in principal&#8217;s office, listening to him talk to his mother on the phone. &#8220;No, Madam,&#8221; Mr. Jakowski said, &#8220;I will not have fighting in my school.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was strange to be picked up early from school. All the other children were in class, except Hank. Billy wasn&#8217;t sure where he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened, Billy?&#8221; his mother asked as they drove home. So Billy explained how he had tried to help Hank.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t fight, Mother!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t even want to fight. I just wanted everybody to quit fighting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother nodded. Billy was different since he had gotten saved. Jesus had taken the fight out of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; asked Billy, &#8220;why did Hank start hitting me? I was trying to help him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he know that it was you?&#8221; Mother asked.</p>

<p>Billy nodded, strongly. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;he knew it was me. But he just kept on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother was quiet a moment. &#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;in Hank&#8217;s home, they fight all the time. There is not much love there. His mother and daddy fight with each other. Hank doesn&#8217;t know what love is.&#8221; Mother stopped talking a moment. &#8220;People need love so desperately,&#8221; she said after a while. &#8220;When they don&#8217;t have it, they need it so much that they do strange things to people they love.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy thought about this. &#8220;You mean that Hank was trying to show me that he loved me by hitting me!&#8221; he said. His Mother nodded.</p>

<p>Poor mixed-up Hank! Trying to show love to people by hitting them! Billy felt sorry for him.</p>

<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Princess,</p>

<p>It is a very special privilege to belong to King Jesus, for all His shining palaces and bright gardens are for you to enjoy. But, many princesses forget this and start acting like beggars. It happened to Princess Precious….</p>

<p>It all began when Discontent flounced into the palace classroom. She didn&#8217;t look like the other princesses at all, but all Princess Precious only saw her bright curls and lacy clothes, so different than her own plain ones. If only Precious had known that Discontent was an Imp from the enemy camp!</p>

<p>But that wasn&#8217;t all of it. When the lessons were given, the new pupil was very rude. &#8220;What a boring thing to do!&#8221; she said, and began to draw.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please attend to your work,&#8221; Mother Matron said. Discontent made a frightful pout and was sent from the room. Then, at recess&#8230;.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Brown-braid!&#8221; Precious turned to see Discontent wink at her. What did <i>she</i> want? &#8220;Want to have curls like mine?&#8221; Precious stopped. &#8220;I have a catalog mirror and comb I can give you, to fix your plain look.&#8221;</p>

<p>Precious blushed, but asked, &#8220;What does the catalog mirror do?&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_14/letter_discontent.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="249" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Why, to show you how to be pretty!&#8221; Discontent pulled out a fat, colorful catalog with a mirror on the front and a shiny comb attached. Precious stepped closer. She did look strange! Discontent shoved it into her hand, saying quickly, &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget, we live a lot better outside these prison walls.&#8221; Then she was gone.</p>

<p>All the rest of the day Precious thought about it. Could she really be pretty and live better? She flipped through the catalog and peered in the mirror. How ugly she looked! She took off her crown and tried combing her hair, but it only tangled. &#8220;It&#8217;s no use!&#8221; she sighed.</p>

<p>Precious lay awake thinking of all the things she wanted in the catalog, and got up with cross thoughts. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure Discontent was right. Life here is dull, and I don&#8217;t feel like a morning chat with King Jesus. I feel like donuts for breakfast and having a vacation.&#8221; She went down to the kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re having waffles,&#8221; Princess Praise said, stopping her singing only a moment. She looked very pretty, but that only made Precious crosser.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want donuts and cocoa,&#8221; she said, when Mother Matron came in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not today!&#8221; she said, then stopped short. &#8220;Why is your hair all messed and your clothes wrinkled, Precious? Did you forget to look in the glass of Truth in the King&#8217;s courtroom?&#8221;</p>

<p>Precious hung her head and muttered, &#8220;I need donuts and a vacation today.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you hear that?&#8221; Mother Matron asked quietly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;ve been to see the King this morning: you look more like a dirty beggar than a princess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t look pretty anyway, and He couldn&#8217;t help&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precious! You must have been poisoned by that wretched little Imp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What Imp?&#8221; But Precious knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are miserable because of Discontent and her words, are you not?&#8221; Precious didn&#8217;t know what to say. She had thought the catalog would make her happy, but it had not.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think a visit with the King will fix this all up,&#8221; Mother Matron said gently.</p>

<p>And it did, though Discontent&#8217;s gifts had to be burned and the tangled hair carefully brushed before the King was satisfied. At last He took Precious on His lap and smiled. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad to have my princess back! Remember that you are a Princess, and never let any lying Imps steal your treasures.&#8221; Precious looked up in surprise, and King Jesus pointed to her golden robe and crown, adding, &#8220;If you will work with Praise today, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll remember many more.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, dear ones, let us also remember this lesson.</p>
