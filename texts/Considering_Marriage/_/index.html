<h1>The Power of Influence</h1>

<p>Choosing a life&#8217;s companion is next to the most important decision one has to make in life&#8212;second only to the decision to accept Christ as one&#8217;s Savior. Many times it helps or hinders one&#8217;s entrance into heaven. So with a burdend heart for your spiritual welfare, the following thoughts are given with a prayer that they may help guide you in choosing the one who will share your life.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+2%3A18" title="Genesis 2:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 2:18)</span></a></span> After God had created man, He saw that man needed a companion, one to share his life, his experiences, his interests, and be a <span class="scripture">&#8220;help meet.&#8221;</span> So God took from Adam&#8217;s side a rib and made a woman and gave her to the man. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+2%3A21-24" title="Genesis 2:21-24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 2:21-24)</span></a></span></p>

<p>When God created man and woman, they were holy and pure and had companionship with Him. But because Eve, Adam&#8217;s wife, yielded to the deceptive influence of Satan (<span class="scripture">&#8220;The serpent beguiled me and I did eat&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+3%3A13" title="Genesis 3:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 3:13)</span></a></span>), she fell from the holy state in which God had created her, and took her companion with her. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+3%3A12" title="Genesis 3:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 3:12)</span></a></span> It is still true today that if one who has lived for God falls from grace, the holy state, he rarely falls alone, but most probably will cause someone else to lose out with God. Many times when husband and wife are both living for God, and one or the other loses his experience of salvation and turns again <span class="scripture">&#8220;to the weak and beggarly elements&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+4%3A9" title="Galatians 4:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 4:9)</span></a></span> of the world, the companion will be influenced or discouraged, and give up the Lord, also.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+6%3A2" title="Genesis 6:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 6:2)</span></a></span> Those who knew God were beguiled by the beauty of the daughters of men. <span class="scripture">&#8220;[They saw] that they were fair,&#8221;</span> which was all they looked at, and followed the choice which their corrupted affections made. They had known God, but were beguiled by those who were strangers to God and godliness. They married strange wives and were unequally yoked with unbelievers. They did not consider God&#8217;s will in choosing wives, but followed their own desires instead of letting God choose wives for them. And what was the result of this? <span class="scripture">&#8220;And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And it repented the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+6%3A5-6" title="Genesis 6:5-6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 6:5-6)</span></a></span> The offspring of these mixed, or unequal, marriages went farther and farther away from God and became so wicked that they were no more the sons of God. Iniquity abounded on the earth and it grieved God.</p>

<p>Dear saved young people, do not be beguiled by the ungodly daughters of men or sons of men. Some are very fair, very intelligent, educated, have charming personalities, but they will prove a snare to you. The sons of God got their eyes off God and were beguiled. That is the way Satan works. That is what happened to Eve. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+3%3A6" title="Genesis 3:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 3:6)</span></a></span> When Eve looked at the forbidden fruit, the devil began to beguile her&#8212;how good, how pleasant to the eyes&#8212;and she disregarded God&#8217;s commandment and took of the forbidden thing. If we keep looking at something that is forbidden, the devil will reason with us of its good qualities; the fruit Eve ate was good for food and was pleasant to look upon. But God had said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Ye shall not eat of it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+3%3A3" title="Genesis 3:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 3:3)</span></a></span> God desires His people to obey Him implicitly because He knows that to disobey, to become entangled with something or someone, however fair, however desirable, that is not pleasing to Him, will bring spiritual disaster.</p>

<p>It is far better to not keep company with the unsaved; to do so will be a snare to the saved. To go ahead and associate with and let one&#8217;s affection go out to the unsaved is treading on very dangerous ground, exposing one&#8217;s self to the wiles of the devil, and will most probably result in one&#8217;s losing out with God.</p>

<p>In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+24">Genesis 24</a> we read the story of Abraham sending his servant to his kindred to obtain a wife for his son, Isaac. He said to his servant, <span class="scripture">&#8220;And I will make thee swear by the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+24%3A3-4" title="Genesis 24:3-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 24:3-4)</span></a></span> This passage of scripture shows how very important Abraham considered it to be that Isaac should take a wife who would worship the true God with him. The Canaanites did not know or worship the true God, but were idol worshippers. Abraham said unto his servant, <span class="scripture">&#8220;I will make thee swear by the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>&#8230;&#8203;that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites.&#8221;</span> This is a most definite cornmand&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;Thou shalt not.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite: Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+26%3A34-35" title="Genesis 26:34-35"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 26:34-35)</span></a></span> Why were the Canaanite wives of Esau a grief of mind to Isaac and his wife Rebakah? The Hittite women were heathens, as were the people of the land, not knowing or worshipping the true God. In the <i>Encyclopedia Brittanica</i> there is an extensive account of the Hittite people. They were an ancient Oriental people, highly civilized, who ruled a great part of Asia Minor and Syria from 2000 to 1200 B.C. They worshipped many gods&#8212;the weather god, the sun goddess, the god of the fields, the heavens, the earth, mountains, rivers, wells, winds, clouds and many others. So these two Hittite women (daughters of Heth) were heathen, and did not worship the one true God, the God of Abraham and Isaac. They no doubt continued their worship of their heathen gods after they became the wives of Esau, and this could well be the cause of the grief of mind of Isaac and Rebekah. Oh, what sadness, heartache and grief godly parents suffer when their children take wives or husbands who do not know or worship the true, Living God, but worship and follow after the gods of this world, and influence the companions away from God. Esau&#8217;s marriages to the Canaanite women have been called foolish marriages, because the Canaanites were strangers to the blessings of Abraham. How foolish for one of God&#8217;s children to unite in marriage with one who is a stranger to God&#8217;s blessings.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+28%3A1" title="Genesis 28:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 28:1)</span></a></span> Isaac here commands Jacob not to become yoked up with the daughters of the heathen Canaanites, as did Esau. And Jacob went back to his mother&#8217;s homeland and took wives of his mother&#8217;s people, and through his lineage came our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.</p>

<h1>Unequally Yoked</h1>

<p>When God led the Hebrew children out of the land of Egypt, we read that there was a <span class="scripture">&#8220;mixed multitude [that] went up also with them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Exodus+12%3A38" title="Exodus 12:38"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Exodus 12:38)</span></a></span> Who and what was this mixed multitude? In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Leviticus+24%3A10-23">Leviticus 24:10-23</a> we read the story of <span class="scripture">&#8220;the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian.&#8221;</span> This was a mixed marriage, a daughter of God&#8217;s people married to an idol-worshipping Egyptian, and the son was one of the <span class="scripture">&#8220;mixed multitude.&#8221;</span> This son <span class="scripture">&#8220;blasphemed the name of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, and cursed,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Leviticus+24%3A11" title="Leviticus 24:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Leviticus 24:11)</span></a></span> and because of this blasphemy and cursing, he was brought forth out of the camp and stoned to death. What sadness and grief this must have been to his mother&#8217;s heart, to have her son to blaspheme and curse, and then to be put to death. We do not know the status of this Egyptian-Israelite marriage at the time the Israelites left Egypt. Perhaps the Egyptian father was dead, or it may be he would not leave Egypt with his family. We see the tragic influence of the ungodly, idol-worshipping Egyptian father manifested in the actions of the son who blasphemed the name of the Lord, and because of this great sin he suffered death. The mother may have realized too late her great mistake in marrying the Egyptian, one who was not a worshipper of the One True God. How much better it would have been if she had married one of her own people; then the father would have been an influence on the son to love the Lord and serve Him, instead of blaspheming the name of the Lord and suffering death. You who may be considering marrying one who is not a child of God, consider this: You are not the only one who will suffer from this kind of marriage. The children who are brought into the world suffer from the spiritual division in the home and the evil influence of the unsaved parent.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;When the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou; And when the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them: <i>Neither shalt thou make marriages with them;</i> thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son. For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+7%3A1-4" title="Deuteronomy 7:1-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Deuteronomy 7:1-4)</span></a></span> Here we have further commandment from the Lord to His people to keep themselves separate from the wicked, ungodly people of the land into which they were going. The Lord plainly tells His people <i>not</i> to make marriages with the heathen and gives them the reason why&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.&#8221;</span> What a solemn warning! God wanted His people to be a separate people then, and He wants His people to be a separate people today. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Leviticus+20%3A26" title="Leviticus 20:26"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Leviticus 20:26)</span></a></span> God wants His people to serve Him only. If one who professes to serve the Lord marries one who is not a child of God, that one is willfully transgressing God&#8217;s emphatic commandment to not marry one who serves other gods, and will surely bring God&#8217;s judgment upon his soul. He may repent and seek God for and receive forgiveness, but, oh, what a harvest of grief and sorrow there will be to reap! <span class="scripture">&#8220;So will the anger of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.&#8221;</span> That is surely too great a price to pay&#8212;to have the anger of the Lord against one.</p>

<p>We read, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+22%3A10" title="Deuteronomy 22:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Deuteronomy 22:10)</span></a></span> Two beasts of a different species cannot associate comfortably together. The ox is generally considered a docile animal, one which could be easily trained, but the ass is proverbially dull and obstinate. To yoke these two animals together would cause constant friction, and they could never pull well together in any kind of work. Surely this would be an unequal yoke. This is a good illustration of the unequal yoke which some have taken upon themselves by yoking up with the unsaved. Jesus said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Take my yoke upon you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+11%3A29" title="Matthew 11:29"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 11:29)</span></a></span> When one is saved from sin and becomes a child of God, he has taken upon himself the yoke of Christ. He is united in spirit to the Lord and cannot, if he pleases the Lord, henceforth be yoked up with the world or a worldly-minded person. If a saved person disregards the plain commandments of God&#8217;s Word and marries one who is unsaved, that one is endeavoring to yoke up the Spirit of Christ with the spirit of the devil, and <i>it will not work</i>. There will be constant friction. The two will be pulling in opposite directions&#8212;the saved toward the things of God, and the unsaved toward the things of the world. The Spirit of Christ and the spirit of the devil do not blend; there is no communion, no fellowship. <span class="scripture">&#8220;For what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? And what concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+6%3A14-15" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 6:14-15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 6:14-15)</span></a></span> There is no fellowship, no spiritual communion, but rather direct opposition. Jesus said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;He that is not with me is against me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+12%3A30" title="Matthew 12:30"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 12:30)</span></a></span> God planned that the husband-wife relationship should be first of all on a spiritual plane, and when the spiritual part of the relationship is ignored or neglected, the relationship descends to a low plane and falls far short of what God planned.</p>

<h1>Separate from Sin</h1>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations&#8230;. For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezra+9%3A1-2" title="Ezra 9:1-2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ezra 9:1-2)</span></a></span> When God delivered His people out of Egypt and led them into the land of Canaan, He gave them the commandment as Ezra relates, <span class="scripture">&#8220;And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments, Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness. Now therefore <i>give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons,</i> nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezra+9%3A10-12" title="Ezra 9:10-12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ezra 9:10-12)</span></a></span> Many of the children of Israel were deliberately and willfully disobedient to God&#8217;s commands and took unto them <span class="scripture">&#8220;strange wives.&#8221;</span> In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezra+10">Ezra 10</a> there is an account of how the people repented and <span class="scripture">&#8220;put away all the wives, and such as are born of them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezra+10%3A3" title="Ezra 10:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ezra 10:3)</span></a></span> To put away the wives and children of these marriages no doubt caused great sorrow and deep grief. All this could have been avoided if the people had obeyed God&#8217;s commandments and not become entangled with those who did not believe in or worship the true and living God. The saved cannot have fellowship with the unsaved. There has to be a &#8220;putting away,&#8221; spiritually speaking. The unsaved goes one way, the saved another. The unsaved goes on in the broad way, but the saved follows the Lord in the strait and narrow way. This spiritual separation between husband and wife causes many and deep heartaches. God calls His people to be a separate, peculiar people, zealous of good works, and they cannot mix with ungodly and worldly activities and keep their relationship clear with God.</p>

<p>Notice what the Lord says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands.&#8221;</span> God did not then want His people to mix with the people who were filthy in His sight, and he does not now want His people to mix with the unclean people of this day. Anyone who has not been washed (spiritually) in the cleansing blood of the Lord Jesus Christ is unclean, filthy in the sight of God. How it must grieve God to have His children let themselves become so blinded by Satan that they cannot see that this kind of a union will but bring disappointment, sadness, heartache, and, many times, tragedy. It is, indeed, a tragedy when one who has been saved from sin&#8212;translated from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God&#8217;s dear Son&#8212;willfully unites himself in the closest earthly union with one who is unsaved, and, therefore, a servant of sin. This kind of a union is not founded on a good spiritual foundation and cannot prosper, nor have God&#8217;s blessing upon it. The Christian loves to read the Word of God, loves to attend worship services, loves the people of God; while the unsaved is not interested in these things, but rather desires the things pertaining to the world. One who is contemplating marriage to an unsaved person may say, &#8220;Oh, but he (or she) would not oppose my being a Christian,&#8221; but Jesus said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;He that is not with me is against me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+12%3A30" title="Matthew 12:30"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 12:30)</span></a></span> If one is not a child of God, then he is a child of the devil, and is against the teachings of the Word of God, the beliefs, and the principles of Christianity. One may say he is not opposed to his companion living for God, but if he (or she) is not also living for God, then the two are living lives that are in direct opposition spiritually. This brings about misunderstandings, hurt feelings, heartaches, and separation in many activities. The one who is saved will have to constantly seek for grace to be able to suffer what the unsaved companion will inflict. You might say, &#8220;Oh, that seems an exaggeration.&#8221; No, it is not an exaggeration. It is not as strong an expression as could be made. Ask any saved person who has lived with an unsaved companion if there can be spiritual harmony in a &#8220;mixed marriage&#8221; home and you will be told that there cannot be. Although they might be reluctant to relate some unhappy experiences they&#8217;ve had with an unsaved companion, you may be sure there were many, and only by constantly seeking God&#8217;s grace could one endure and keep the victory.</p>

<p>If a saved person deliberately disobeys the scriptural teachings concerning marriage with the unsaved, and goes on and unites in marriage with a sinner, the Spirit of God is grieved and God will not bless that union unless there is repentance and coming back to God. But the marriage has taken place and God holds the two as husband and wife, bound together for life (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+7%3A39">I&nbsp;Corinthians 7:39</a>), regardless of what may come along life&#8217;s way.</p>

<p>If you marry an unsaved person, you may live the remainder of your life with a heavy heart because you stepped outside of God&#8217;s will. The Lord wants you to be happy in your marriage. He wants your heart to sing with joy. But this will not be so if you disobey God&#8217;s commandments.</p>

<p>Many young people have made the mistake of marrying an unsaved person thinking they could win the husband or wife to the Lord. In most cases, this leads only to great disappointment and heartbreak. The unsaved one generally goes on in the downward way, farther and farther from God, and the joy, the companionship hoped for, is never realized.</p>

<p>Dear young people, let God direct you in choosing a companion. You cannot of yourself choose the right companion. You may think that a certain one is the only one who can give you the love and happiness you desire, but it may be that love will grow cold, will wither and die. It may be that the passing of the years, with the troubles and problems of life and changing attitudes, will erode that young love until there is no love left, but the two are bound together by the marriage bond. What an unhappy state! How much better to let God give one a companion, then love and understanding will grow with the passing years and God&#8217;s blessing will be upon that union. You cannot know what one&#8217;s actions, words, and attitudes will be down through the years. You want and need one to stand by you in sickness with loving care, kind and encouraging words. You need someone who will uphold you in difficult and trying times with understanding and with earnest prayers, someone who will plead to God for the healing balm for you when your heart is crushed and broken from sorrow and disappointment. If one does not have a saved companion, there may be accusations instead of comfort, denunciations instead of blessings, criticism instead of appreciation.</p>

<p>God alone knows the right companion for you. With a yielded will, seek God earnestly to direct you in choosing a life&#8217;s companion, and remember to marry <span class="scripture">&#8220;<i>only</i> in the Lord.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+7%3A39" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 7:39"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 7:39)</span></a></span></p>
