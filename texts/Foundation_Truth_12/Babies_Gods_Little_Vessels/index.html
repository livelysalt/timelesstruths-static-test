<h1>Babies&#8212;God&#8217;s Little Vessels</h1>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Foundation_Truth_12/babies_a.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="124" /></div>
<p>One of God&#8217;s little vessels was in our midst for almost a year. We did not expect the permanent guardianship to be terminated. It seemed everything was on our side, and that the best interest of the child would prevail. We didn&#8217;t know God&#8217;s appointment for her would end so soon. It seemed almost everyone in the court room was shocked that the verdict would be to take her from the stable environment she had enjoyed her first year. She was a happy, well-adjusted baby, yet very wary of strangers. But it had been prayed that God would cause the judge to speak God&#8217;s will for the baby. We wanted God to have His way even if it hurt.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Foundation_Truth_12/babies_b.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="109" /></div>
<p>As we recovered from the shock and started dealing with the reality of it all, we asked, why must she suffer so? She won&#8217;t understand! There was no possible way to communicate our love, care, and great concern for her welfare to one so young! She had won our hearts by her sweet innocent smiles and affection given. She was just learning to walk. She was articulating that little tongue, and many sounds were beginning to form words. How delightful to watch a little one learn and grow! And now she must go away. What would her future be like? How hard the anticipation of parting! Tears, sleepless hours, praying for forgiveness of the unjustness to the child.</p>

<p>We were confident God was watching over all. The sad day arrived&#8212;Resurrection Sunday; there were weekend guests at services. It was still our Gethsemane. The text of the Sunday school lesson was in Rev. 19:6-9, &#8220;fine linen is the righteousness of saints.&#8221; It was brought out that it is hard in great tribulation to keep your robes washed, but we must! We must be free from any resentment or bitterness. Then the second message was taken from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+1%3A14-20">Mark 1:14-20</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8220;The time is fulfilled.&#8221;</span> We can dip in the stream of righteousness. How all of the prayers of the saints helped in that hour. The Lord knows how to draw all His people together. Around 1:00 p.m. our family all drove to meet the new parents at the appointed place. It was raining&#8212;it seemed God was crying too. As we rode along, our minds went back over the past year and it&#8217;s happenings: the attempted kidnapping, how God helped then and protected, how the promises of God really came alive. One sister called from out-of-state to give us this scripture: <span class="scripture">&#8220;The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+34%3A7" title="Psalm 34:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 34:7)</span></a></span> I thought about how the baby&#8217;s presence had brought us closer to God. The Lord had used this little human vessel to help those around her get closer to God. It was then my prayer that she would be able to continue the job God had for her, as she moved on to this new home. The Lord gave opportunity for this to be shared with the new mother as tears flowed in the giver as well as the receiver.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Foundation_Truth_12/babies_c.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="128" /></div>
<p>Oh, all who know the power of prayer, may you also lift your heart to heaven for the little vessel God is using to touch lives! Just think of all the little vessels God is using to touch lives everywhere! What a different place this world would be if there were no babies. Each little life is such a miracle. They are God&#8217;s gifts, just lent to us for a time. Parents, don&#8217;t take your children for granted. They are very special&#8212;study them, get all the good God has for you in sending them to you. He has things to teach you through them.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Foundation_Truth_12/babies_d.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="112" /></div>
<p>It is an amazing picture. God continually sends innocent little ones among the human race. It is true that they each become tainted with the nature of sin upon conception, but they are innocent before God in that they have committed no wrong, and they remain innocent for a number of years. How this innocence works on the hearts of mankind! What mercy, that God continually blesses the human race in this way! Some are wanted and desired; many are not. The precious gift of innocence is despised and disregarded with many, but still it exerts its effect. Even when the recipients abuse and neglect the precious little one, the lesson will not go away. The increased brutality on the part of the unappreciative continues to preach and warn, though the little innocent ones suffer in their mission.</p>

<p>Then they come to an age where they are accountable for their doings, and they sin, too. The little innocent ones are no longer innocent, but sinners before a just and loving God. And then, in their turn, as they continue on, God sends them yet more little innocent ones&#8230;. Thus the entire human race goes through an enormously significant change. All were clear before God at one time. Then <span class="scripture">&#8220;all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+3%3A23" title="Romans 3:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 3:23)</span></a></span> Then a few are saved. O reader! Will you be one of those who come back to God? Will you find what it means to be innocent before Him again? <span class="scripture">&#8220;Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+18%3A3" title="Matthew 18:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 18:3)</span></a></span></p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Foundation_Truth_12/babies_e.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="126" /></div>
<p>Adolf Hitler was once innocent before God. King Ahab and Queen Jezebel were once innocent little ones. Genghis Khan, at one time, had done no sin. God, in His mercy, continually injects living proof that there is innocence before God in human beings. It is possible to regain that innocence after losing it to sin. Oh, that all men would <span class="scripture">&#8220;become as little children&#8221;</span>!</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Foundation_Truth_12/babies_f.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="123" /></div>
<p>The sacrifice was made. The baby was committed to God&#8217;s keeping and both cars went opposite directions. We have been comforted that God is watching over her. It has been only a week ago, but it seems like its been a month. There just seems to be a curtain between us and the grief we experienced. Surely we serve the God of all comfort.</p>

<p>The Lord gave my husband this scripture: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that in heaven <b>their angels</b> do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+18%3A10" title="Matthew 18:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 18:10)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+35%3A10" title="Isaiah 35:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 35:10)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+30%3A5" title="Psalm 30:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 30:5)</span></a></span></p>
