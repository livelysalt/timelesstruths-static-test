<h1>Dear Reader</h1>

<p>As I look at the front and back covers of this issue, I am strongly reminded of these two aspects of our walk with the Lord&#8212;uplift and danger. The Lord is in the business of redeeming lost humans, and lifting us up from the pit of sin and despair to the high places of His love and grace, but because we always are free to choose, the peril of falling remains.</p>

<p>Just as the mountaineer&#8217;s triumph is all the more real because of the real dangers involved in the climbing, so the ascent to the spiritual heights the Lord has for us are accomplishments to cause real rejoicing because the possibilities of not making it are real.</p>

<p>We rejoice greatly when we have the privilege of seeing people respond to the cry of the watchmen, &#8220;Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion to the Lord our God,&#8221; not only because we are burdened as the watchmen in the scripture is to cry out this message, but also because so many succumb to the perils of the way. Indeed, I&#8217;ve cried out for help more than once this past week, and by the grace of God I&#8217;m still climbing, thanks be to God!</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+3%3A16" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 3:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 3:16)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Now something can be profitable without you or me profiting from it. I am grateful that there is something profitable available to me, but I want to actually profit from it.</p>

<p>If I need some truth to lean on, or if I need to be checked in something I&#8217;m aiming to do, or if I&#8217;m mistaken and need to be corrected, or if I need to know what is right to do in my situation, the Word of God has what I need. What do I need to do, to see to it that I <i>do</i> profit? <span class="scripture">&#8220;All scripture is given by inspiration of God.&#8221;</span> This alerts me right away, that if it took the Lord&#8217;s inspiration for the scriptures to initially be written, then I need the same inspiration from the same source to get the benefit that was designed in it all the way to me. Sometimes I have needed to humble down, and get rid of my own notions. Other times, I have needed to have some foundation laid (perhaps some other truths in the scripture, or some experiences the Lord must give me) to be in the position to get the inspiration. Still other times, I could not get to the point of inspiration without being in the midst of spiritual battle, in the midst of a trial&#8212;and then the inspiration blazed out to me in my time of great need.</p>

<p>Dear readers, what you read in the following pages are truths that we have found profitable for us, and we desire them to be profitable for you. If you need to humble down, please do&#8212;the inspiration is so necessary, so precious. If you must wait on the Lord to have some more foundation laid, be patient and wait on Him, for <span class="scripture">&#8220;when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+13%3A12" title="Proverbs 13:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 13:12)</span></a></span> If you are in the midst of the battle, may the &#8220;Lord of battles&#8221; inspire it to your immediate need, and to many future needs as well.</p>

<p>Our heart&#8217;s desire is to see more of you in Zion&#8212;pray for us, we want to stay on the mountain!</p>

<h1>God at Work Today</h1>

<p>We seek to print what the Lord has anointed to our hearts, whether written by our hands or those of others&#8212;a lot of blessing has come to our hearts through some recent correspondence, which we have reproduced with slight modifications below.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Please, tell us what kind of church you are. We are particularly interested with the true church of God saints who have fled the apostasy&#8212;which is still called the &#8220;Church of God,&#8221; but is nothing but divided and hating people who seem to ignore the Word of God, which demands unity and love of God&#8217;s children. It is such a deplorable situation; we are disgusted with all the sectarianism depicted by the Church-of-Godism today. We are these days so afraid of man rule that we are shy about whom we fellowship or get involved with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noindent first">Dear Bro. &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;,</p>

<p>Greetings in the name of Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep. I am writing to you with a full heart; and, in accordance with <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+12%3A17">Romans 12:17</a>, I am determined to tell you as fully as I know about the battles and burden of our times in general and what specific experience and direct knowledge I have of things.</p>

<p>I was saved when I was eight years of age, just a child; but the experience was very real and definite. Before then, I had been raised in a Christian home by folks who were saved (their background was Nazarene, therefore holiness), but it was all mental&#8212;I knew not anything of God from the heart. This all changed when God spoke peace to my soul.</p>

<p>Although entire sanctification as a definite second work of grace was taught where my folks went (and by then, my father had found the teachings of the church of God and had left the Nazarene church), I did not find that experience in services, but at home, in the woods, when I was thirteen. I could take you to the spot where I died, kneeling on an old metal folding chair, and the Holy Spirit took full possession. God broke the high-minded opinion I had of myself as a result of being raised to excel in the world, and He broke the ambition that went with it. How I do praise Him for His great mercy to me! I would never have survived the things that followed on my pilgrimage if God had not brought me to that.</p>

<p>The congregation that my father found had largely the form of doctrine correctly, but the essence and spirit of the truth was passing from them because they were not willing to pay the full price to walk in the light as He is in the light. They perceived it not, and were a great deal like the congregation in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+3%3A17">Revelation 3:17</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.&#8221;</span> It was in this place that I made my start to serve my Lord with all my heart, and there was no difference between me and them that would have given me any advantage. The only difference has been that I was not satisfied to dabble at this; that is, to play a game. The next verse in the above quoted reads, <span class="scripture">&#8220;I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+3%3A18" title="Revelation 3:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 3:18)</span></a></span> This buying of the gold tried in the fire is the way of the Lord, for it is what He did while He was down here. It will make one spiritually rich. It could have made them spiritually rich, too; but I am sorry to report that they chose it not, and I am fairly confident that He took away their candlestick, and their house has been left desolate. My mother yet abides in that congregation, although she gets no food there.</p>

<p>I went from there to other congregations among a group of people. The Lord had called me to be a minister for Him, and I labored among those people for many years, until about 1989. There was a great deal of spirituality among them when I first started, although a decline was evident, and particularly evident in some congregations. But a number had a vision from God and considerable light and blessing. Most of those brethren are gone home, and the succeeding generation of leaders have fallen away a lot.</p>

<p>As a example of the light they had on man rule, I will tell you of an experience I had as a young minister. I was very naive and did not realize how someone could take advantage of me. I loved the Lord dearly and earnestly wanted to measure up to all truth; I was very vulnerable to counsel and did not have the seasoning to discriminate subtly between truth and error. One dear brother had been a blessing to me, and I very sincerely entreated him to come to me if he saw anything wrong with me and tell me. He looked at me, comprehending my youth and inexperience, and said, &#8220;Brother &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;, God bless you, if I see anything wrong with you, I think I&#8217;ll go tell Jesus and let Him tell you.&#8221; This kind of love, this kind of respect for God and His ways, this kind of humility&#8212;it won my confidence and set a standard in my heart and mind. The brethren were reluctant to assume any more responsibility in my life than the Lord had laid upon them; they would not lay hands upon the ark.</p>

<p>I watched this group of ministers compromise and sin, including the same minister who told me what I related above. In 1984, they had a minister&#8217;s meeting in which they were afraid to deal with a minister who was plainly off on a number of lines. He was influential, and they were afraid it would split them. There were a few who opposed that compromise at the meeting, and all of them are gone now to meet the Lord. A number of the spiritual ones who taught us in the last years of their lives were not in the body by the time of the above-mentioned minister&#8217;s meeting. The decline was very definite after that. A spirit of human wisdom and reasoning took hold, and real authority and blessing from God departed. Eventually, He led us out&#8212;first He required it of me, and I left without my wife; then He dealt with her and led her out. Our children were young; we had expected there to be a small handful of saints, at least, but all of those in whom we had good confidence decided to stay in. It did not seem that God was dealing with them as He dealt with us, and this was hard to understand, but I felt then and I feel now that we must be true to God, whatever the cost.</p>

<p>We would not have survived if God had not helped us, <b>but He did help us!</b> He had prepared a family. They knew nothing of the true church and were members of a big, proud Baptist church where his parents were missionaries. Her parents were doctors. It seems incredible that God even works in such places, but He did. They were honest and willing to pay the price to walk in the light. Brother &#8212;&#8212;&#8212; told me that he keep feeling that &#8220;there had to be more.&#8221; This was surely true, and they left. A fanatical couple found them and dominated them. This just about finished them and thoroughly prejudiced their relatives against them. Finally, they escaped this couple, and as Brother &#8212;&#8212;&#8212; puts it, &#8220;floundered around.&#8221; Then she met my wife at a homeschooling function. They were drawn to the truth, and we began to meet together.</p>

<p>We have made numerous efforts to find other saints who want to walk in the light, and have found a lot of people who don&#8217;t. We have met with a group of folks who escaped from a deception, only to watch as nearly all of them went out into the world while still professing. Most of the survivors have been greatly damaged and hurt. Hardly any have escaped bitterness. There are a few who know us and attend our local services from time to time, but most of them will not have anything to do with us. Our closeness of life reminds them too much of where they escaped, and they are afraid we are like their old masters and will try to dominate them as they were dominated. That is about the last thing we would want to do, but they will not give it a chance to prove itself, so they only feel comfortable with people who do not live very carefully. This includes the people we had to leave. Evidences of spiritual need are rampant among them. They are being devoured by the world, little by little.</p>

<p>We have learned, little by little, how very much there is out there, and it is not longer a mystery to me why there are few that be saved (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+13%3A23-24">Luke 13:23-24</a>). The opposition of the enemy of all righteousness is quite effective in the minds and hearts of mankind. But, I am glad to report, God is still saving people right now (a new one was born in the family this past Sunday), and there are people everywhere who want the gospel message and are willing to meet God&#8217;s requirements to them as He makes it known.</p>

<p>When we first heard from you, your correspondence coincided with a number of other letters, which overwhelmed the amount of time available for correspondence. There was a letter from a man who had escaped from Islam after 30 years of immersion in that religion. (He seems to have really got something from God, and recently the Lord healed him of an awful affliction.) There was another letter from some folks who assumed a fellowship with us which did not seem to have any foundation to it&#8212;they did not know us, but claimed that we had just what they were looking for, etc. We took these burdens and others to the Lord for direction. The ones who assumed fellowship wrote us every week, but we could not feel a burden from God to reply, so we waited. Eventually it came out that they wanted money. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+13%3A5-6" title="Hebrews 13:5-6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 13:5-6)</span></a></span> This exposed motive was sad to see, but we were glad that we had waited on God. We have tried to be led by the Lord in our replies, for we want to really be of help to people. We are poor people, too, and live by faith. However, if God gives us something to pass along, we want the blessing of passing it along. Mostly, though, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Silver and gold have [we] none.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+3%3A6" title="Acts 3:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 3:6)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Now, regardless of where this goes, I want to say that the Lord has given us a heart of love for you. As a brother said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know you, but I know God, and He knows you; so, indirectly, I know you.&#8221; That is, I recognize the principles at stake in these writings, agree with them, and want to do you any good I can.</p>

<p>We have nothing for you to join. Consequently, we have nothing that we can kick you out of, either. Unless God gives us something for you, both in material and in spiritual things, we have nothing to give. He has given us a love and burden for you.</p>

<p>I am sending you several writings. One is Sister Lottie Jarvis&#8217; book, <a href="../../../texts/A_True_Story_in_Allegory/index.html" title="A True Story in Allegory">A True Story in Allegory</a>. It symbolically portrays compromise and fanaticism. I hope and pray that it is a blessing.</p>

<p class="signature">Love and prayers,
<br />Bro. &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p class="noindent first">Dear Bro. &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;,</p>

<p>Holy greetings to you, dear brother, in the name of the Dear Lord and Master. Praise the Lord for all His goodness and mercy! <span class="scripture">&#8220;O sing unto the Lord a new song; for he hath done marvelous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+98%3A1" title="Psalm 98:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 98:1)</span></a></span> I thank God for using you to bless and raise me higher up in the heavenly places and in great hopes and confidence in the Lord. May He continue to use you this way with all other seekers and those hungry for the Truth. Amen. First, allow me to tell you that I am saved and living a holy life the best I know how through the power of the Holy Ghost. I love the Lord and live for Him with all He has given me&#8212;body, soul, and all else. Please, continue to pray for me to live a victorious life all the rest of my life.</p>

<p><i>[At this point, the author identified six different religious persuasions in his area of residence.]</i> All these divisions are characterized by hatred, strife, bitterness, and so on, within themselves, and against the other groups. Each one uses money to woo followers here and keep them held up to a small or great extent, &#8212;&#8212;&#8212; being the richest and most affluent, but very small. Local members keep fighting for position to get the money and its advantages. I know all of them and have been actively involved in Numbers 1, 2, 4 and 5; tried to work as part of each one of them, but had to flee out of one to the other as rottenness became noticeable, and I opposed it to no avail. I experienced what the Lord says in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+51%3A9">Jeremiah 51:9</a>&#8212;if Babylon could be healed, He would have healed her.</p>

<p>God had initially showed me in a vision that He has a clean, pure, and spotless church, made up of only the pure in heart here on the earth. I did not comprehend the meaning of this wonderful vision then, in October 1977. So I jumped from one group to the other, hoping it was the pure Bride of Christ I had seen in the vision, but only to be frustrated. Then, in around June 2002, God in His love, care, and grace, sent me another wonderful vision, which I did not comprehend clearly until the beginning of 2003. He showed me that I was faithfully going after Jesus, but before I would reach Him, a group would emerge in between with its fogs. I would get enmeshed in this group and get blinded by the fog, but would almost as soon find out that Jesus was not in the group. Then I would get out, see Jesus afar off on the Way ahead and start running after Him again, only to be obstructed by a group again. It was not until I had run clear out of every group division that I caught up with Jesus, who hugged me and kissed me and held me by the hand to lead me on. As said before, I did not see what the Lord was teaching me in this vision until January 2003. When the full meaning of this vision sunk into my mind, I completely stopped looking for groups, confessed my unfaithfulness to the Lord, and fully consecrated to serve Him and Him only as He showed and led me free from all divisions and their inherent evils. I offered to Him my whole being and asked God to fill me with His Holy Ghost, which I understood as His fully taking His abode in my body (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+14%3A23%3B+1+Corinthians+6%3A19-20">John 14:23; I&nbsp;Corinthians 6:19-20</a>), cleansing me wholly from all carnality and giving me the power to live holy all my life. It was then peace flooded my soul, joy unspeakable became part of my life in all circumstances, and love for God and all His creation is now so much my part of life that I would give everything to live this way. I am rejoicing in this glory up to now, for which I truly thank God.</p>

<p>I made all effort to do restitution to the best of my ability and I am still willing to do it whenever I become aware of anything of the past not corrected or returned to whoever owed. It is this love that sent me to the internet, after seeing what several men are doing, to look and see if there are brothers like that in the other parts of &#8212;&#8212;&#8212; and also in the other parts of the world. I have written to several, but many have proved to be only sects (from studying what is in their websites), and others have never bothered to reply. Some have replied but as soon as they ask about me from the groups I have mentioned above, they cut me off completely. Letters accusing me of all sorts of things have been flying all over. Some are genuine but most are false accusations. I do not know what you will do with me when you ask about me from those groups I have mentioned above, but I trust the Lord to lead you the right way and would not blame you at all if you decide to cut me off, too. But I have a soul and I expect every true man of God to be fair and true to my soul. That is one reason I have lost faith in all those groups I have listed above. They do not care about a soul that has rejected or found fault with them. However, I am entirely in the hands of the Lord and want determinedly to remain there until He takes me home. Please, pray for me in that God-given love for me you mentioned in your letter.</p>

<p>Now, in the light of what I have said above, I hope you can see what you mean to me at this very needy hour and why I am rejoicing about your coming my way. The material you have sent me has been so uplifting and encouraging that I truly thank you. I have read all of it and will studiously, prayerfully, re-read it all over again. God has been true and poured His love upon me again through you. I have refused (I am referring to <a href="../../../texts/A_True_Story_in_Allegory/index.html" title="A True Story in Allegory">A True Story in Allegory</a>) Mrs. Simpleton&#8217;s great praise Ointment, also Mr. Big Heart&#8217;s purse of gold coins, and Mr. Worldly-Wise&#8217;s little gilt-edged book on philosophy. I no longer desire to indulge in the forbidden things and becoming a friend of the world, thus incurring the enmity with God. I want to be a member of the &#8220;Hold-Fast Family&#8221; on the top of Mt. Zion where I can see the heavenly home. The &#8220;Apostasy Valley&#8221; with its &#8220;little villages of like-mindedness and group spirits&#8221; no longer appeals to me. I am so glad to be free of this group spirit. I want to be one with those who are doing all the King&#8217;s will as revealed in His law. Praise the Lord!</p>

<p>So, my dear brother, have you been to &#8220;the Revelation Point&#8221; near the &#8220;Celestial Country&#8221;? Are your souls &#8220;vibrating with the harmonies of heaven&#8217;s music&#8221;? Are you holding &#8220;a convocation and reading of the law of the Lord&#8221;? Will you welcome us to the Camp of the Saints and help us stay there waiting for our Lord&#8217;s return? I await the answer prayerfully and humbly. But please, be forewarned that we do not expect to be dragged back to the &#8220;Morality Plain&#8221; in the &#8220;Apostasy Valley.&#8221; We have committed our all to the Lord (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+1%3A12">II&nbsp;Timothy 1:12</a>). We are hoping to be one with those whom the King is adding to on the Sea of Glass (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+15%3A2-4%3B+Matthew+25%3A33%3B+13%3A30">Revelation 15:2-4; Matthew 25:33; 13:30</a>). They are the ones eating the fruits of the tree of life on this side of the River of Life&#8212;this tabernacle of flesh (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+5%3A1-4">II&nbsp;Corinthians 5:1-4</a>) &#8212;while awaiting the return of the Lord. We feel He is so near (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+25%3A6">Matthew 25:6</a>), and that the door will soon be shut immediately He comes (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+13%3A25">Luke 13:25</a>). I want to be found there, within the walls of the City (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+26%3A1%3B+60%3A18">Isaiah 26:1; 60:18</a>) where I am constantly beholding the great heavenly city, having the glory of God (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+21%3A10">Revelation 21:10</a>). This is the only glory I want. My dear ones, may the dear Lord keep blessing you and refreshing you as you have refreshed me. My hope and courage has been so raised that I am rejoicing and thanking the Lord for you. Thank you, once again, very much.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noindent first">Dear Bro. &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;,</p>

<p>Thank you so much for writing. We are praying that your trials and tribulations will work together for much good in your life and ours, too.</p>

<p>I want to say right away that no one has told us anything about you, and all that we know is what you have related in the emails that we have received from you. If we had heard anything, then we would have just committed it to God anyway, until He caused the truth of the matter to be revealed. But we haven&#8217;t heard or seen any of those letters that you have mentioned.</p>

<p>This scripture has been a comfort to me in these things: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man&#8217;s sake.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+6%3A22" title="Luke 6:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 6:22)</span></a></span> Jesus has a blessing for us in being misrepresented, as long as there is no merit to the rumors or charges. <span class="scripture">&#8220;If, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+2%3A20-21" title="I&nbsp;Peter 2:20-21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 2:20-21)</span></a></span></p>

<p>The Lord gave me something that has been of great value to me when I was in a trial from people&#8217;s talk. The realization that I was being treated this way had hovered over me for quite a bit of time&#8212;several months, as I recall&#8212;and it was getting me down. Just crushing and depressing me. I went out to a pasture to pray in a car that I had. I knelt down in the grass by the open door and poured out my heart to God. He gave me an answer: <b>It&#8217;s not so much what happens to you in life that matters; it&#8217;s how you take it!</b> This came as light from heaven to my soul. These things could do me good! God had designed them carefully to work together for my good! My despair was turned to praise. The Lord said, &#8220;It&#8217;s not how people treat you; it&#8217;s how you treat people!&#8221; Praise His name! Yea, <span class="scripture">&#8220;We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A28" title="Romans 8:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 8:28)</span></a></span></p>

<p>It is our blood-bought privilege to live right all the time&#8212;in the face of the most awful evil and wickedness. To overcome evil with good by the power of God. To take without flinching the most scalding rejection and vituperation. To stay humble and loving in our heart in the face of the most outrageous injustice. Jesus has bought and paid for an experience in our hearts to do this, and He carefully regulates our temptations and trials so that we are not tempted above that we can ably bear. He makes a way of escape in His grace so that we can bear it.</p>

<p>Meeting these experiences is exceedingly dangerous to our spiritual life, yet it is the very means that God uses to help us grow and thrive. A minister was once preaching on the battles of the church at Ephesus in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+2%3A1-7">Revelation 2:1-7</a>. He read, <span class="scripture">&#8220;how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+2%3A2" title="Revelation 2:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 2:2)</span></a></span> Then he read, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+2%3A4" title="Revelation 2:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 2:4)</span></a></span> He said, &#8220;This is very likely where they lost their first love&#8212;in exposing and dealing with the false brethren.&#8221; I believe he had and has a good point. It is of great importance to me to learn the secrets that God wants to teach me of how to maintain holiness without losing holiness. (If you think that you must step outside of holiness to maintain holiness, you have already lost it.)</p>

<p>It is in this spirit and attitude that we value the writing of Sister Lottie Jarvis, <a href="../../../texts/A_True_Story_in_Allegory/index.html" title="A True Story in Allegory">A True Story in Allegory</a>. She was a survivor of the great compromise after the 1880 reformation (this compromise occurred between 1910-1915). I believe that God gave her this message in symbolical form to help those who would hunger for and lay hold on truth after her time.</p>

<p>I heard a story of a minister. He said at one time that if God would hand him the Bible and say, &#8220;Here, George, just take this book and fix it to fit you,&#8221; he would just hand the Bible back to God and say, &#8220;God, the book is all right just like it is. Just fix George to fit the book.&#8221; I believe this with all my heart. God has already made a church that is just right. He operates it, puts people in it as they as saved, and takes them out if they sin. When men lose sight of it, it still continues on just as God wants it to do so. His way is perfect. It is just as it should be. The kingdom has not been left to other people (including you and me). Jesus runs it, for He is the Head of the body. Nobody fools Him. He deals with everyone justly and rightly. He helps us to hold still and wait on Him to do His work. He gives us courage and faith to trust Him for strength to do the work He has for us.</p>

<p>The 1880 reformation was a re-discovery of what God had and had been doing all the time since Jesus built His church, against which the gates of hell have never prevailed. It was there all the time while men stumbled around and lost sight of what truth was, what man rule was, what Holy Spirit government was. It will be there if you or I lose it. If everyone in the world were to turn away from Jesus, the gates of hell still would not prevail, for paradise is filled with saints, who are going to be coming back with Him at the end of time.</p>

<p>My dear friend, we have no power to turn you back from truth. You can go on and be faithful to God without our assistance at all. But we do love the Lord and want to do what He has for us to do all the time. We are thankful that we have received a kingdom which cannot be moved, and we pray for grace to be faithful and hear, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Welcome, thou good and faithful servant! Enter thou into the joys of thy Lord!&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+25%3A14-30" title="Matthew 25:14-30"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 25:14-30)</span></a></span> The Lord of the harvest has posted us in a little place in His vineyard. He has laid a burden on our heart to be &#8220;Johnny Appleseed&#8217;s&#8221; for Him. (This individual was an American figure, and his life illustrates what I am trying to say.) What we live, preach, and teach is not a secret. Saints have been living it for years. The narrow path is well-worn. Many have lived it before you and me. We are deeply interested in those truths that served them so well. We want to learn them and lay hold on eternal life, too.</p>

<p>I, too, abhor the fog line. I want nothing to do with an atmosphere &#8220;which causes the objects therein to appear much taller than they really are, so that a very ordinary person appears as a walking giant, especially to himself.&#8221; I have learned something of the extreme danger of thinking of myself more highly&#8212;not soberly&#8212;than I ought to think (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+12%3A3">Romans 12:3</a>).</p>

<p>It is possible for us to be one in Christ without trying to be one in each other. We can keep each other consecrated to the Master and let Him inform or reveal about us that which either makes unity or reveals the lack of it. It is blessed to abide in the vine without unduly concerning myself over how my brother is doing. I can leave that to Him who knows all things and has all power.</p>

<p>And, so, dear brother, we rejoice in your escape from the groups of men. We especially rejoice in your continued love for them and your watchfulness to keep everything as clear as you can toward them. God has appointed you your Sanballat&#8217;s, Tobiah&#8217;s, and Geshem&#8217;s to refine you and humble you. You will not be able to build the wall acceptably without the effect of these deadly trials. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Beloved, think it not strange.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+4%3A12" title="I&nbsp;Peter 4:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 4:12)</span></a></span> They are our path to heaven.</p>

<p>We are only some of the smallest and most unworthy of the King&#8217;s servants (for He has many), but you set the joy-bells ringing around here when you follow the Lord&#8217;s way with all your heart. All of His servants joy in His salvation. All adore His great plan and shout His praises, both those of us down here and those above who are resting.</p>

<p>So as to what we will do with you is what we have learned to do all the time: <b>commit you to God</b>, as we do ourselves, also. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+4%3A19" title="I&nbsp;Peter 4:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 4:19)</span></a></span></p>

<p>A great number of the names mentioned in your letter are unknown to us. I would be glad to do good to any of these people if good can be done, but I am doubtful that there is an open door. We have approached some folks in the past to try to be of help, only to find that they were not really open, and that we were naive.</p>

<p>Please write to us as often as you wish and ask any questions you wish to ask. I am attaching a chapter from Sister Katherine Helm&#8217;s book, <i>The Lure of Divine Love</i>, and <a href="../../../texts/God_or_a_System_Which/index.html" title="God or a System: Which?">a tract by Sister Jarvis</a> that you might enjoy.</p>

<p class="noindent first">Dear Bro. &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;,</p>

<p>Greetings dear brother, in the name of the Dear Lord. My problem is this. There were many preachers in the meetings. Many of them want to come over to us and work with us as whole congregations. To me, this is fearful, particularly when I consider what Ezra did (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezra+9-10">Ezra 9-10</a>). The people had to get rid of <span class="scripture">&#8220;strange wives.&#8221;</span> John the Baptizer would not baptize those who had not repented. The early church would not work together with the Pharisees, Sadducees, and the scribes. Therefore, please, advise me on what line of action to take in these matters. My feeling is that they all individually have to forsake all their Babylonian ideologies and traits, and for the ministers to sit down in the pews, until they know all the truth, measure to it and then be sure the Lord has laid a hand on them to minister. If this be the case, who will then minister to the distant congregations, as there are so few church of God ministers? But it is a hard thing for them to do. As for the individuals in the individual congregations, my feeling is that they should each examine themselves and if any feel they have ever sinned (which is so common in the sect world who teach the &#8220;sin-you-must&#8221; doctrine) since they initially professed salvation, they lost out with the Lord. So they have to come in through the altar. But this cannot be done legalistically. The Lord needs to show them this, and not me demanding it of them. It is a predicament. Can you please, advise me?</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Bro. &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;,</p>

<p>Greetings in the name of the Lord and Master. I shall now be able to send you another question, which for ease of reference, I mark as Number Two here below. Please, help with answers and comments if the Lord gives you the time. If you cannot get the time, please, let another minister (true church of God minister, please) help me. Please, I do not ask the questions unkindly in any argumentative spirit or in any testing spirit. I just want to know, and also I want to know if the Lord has given us the same light in some matters or it is just my &#8220;notions.&#8221; I have also been mixing up with the false Church-of-Godism and there are some things I must get rid of. Therefore, please, do not take me wrongly when I ask questions. I believe you are on the mountain and can help me and the church here to live there. God bless your heart, dear brother.</p>

<p>2. Divorce and Remarriage:</p>

<ol class="list-a">
<li>I have read the article on the above subject on the website. I would like to know if this is the saints&#8217; stand on divorce and remarriage. I ask this because you have written a disclaimer on the website saying that whatever you add to your site is not to be taken as your stand. I just want to be sure.</li>

<li>Jesus said that there should be no putting away of a wife (spouse) except for adultery/fornication. How is this exception taken by the saints? Is it their stand that one should live with the spouse in spite of adultery/fornication?</li>

<li>I have always stood that marriage is for &#8220;till death doth part us.&#8221; (But the &#8220;putting away of wives&#8221; for other reasons other than adultery/fornication by many people here has puzzled me and I have met even American ministers who have married women who have left their husbands or who have been put away. One of the minister-missionaries defended their actions by telling me that marriage was for this life when we are in the flesh and for our happiness and should not therefore be taken as influencing life after death. Please, comment.) Do we disfellowship those who marry women who are put away? Do we disfellowship wives who have married men who have been put away? Are people who have remarried those put away to be accepted as ministers and even as saints?</li>

<li>Here, we have people who do not marry the Christian way (church marriages), or even the legal way (going to a registrar of marriages other than a pastor and getting legal documents as they are married). The traditional way is that a man and a woman just come together and live as man and wife as long as they are permitted by the parents of both parties&#8212;though mainly it is the girls&#8217; parents who play the greater part of permitting the marriage. We do not take this as a Christian way of marrying as it sets a bad example and is actually living in fornication. We insist that such people marry legally and in church. Can you please comment?</li>

</ol>
<p>Please, as I said before, help if you can. But if you do not have the time, we would be glad if another minister can help.</p>

<p>Trusting to hear from you as the Lord leads and directs. Blessings and love from this way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="signature first">Dear Bro. &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;,</p>

<p>Greetings in the name of Jesus. I checked my email this morning and retrieved your two letters on fellowship and divorce and remarriage.</p>

<p>Let me say first that I feel very inadequate to the task of answering your questions. Although I have a good hold on the Bible principles involved, and the Lord has blessed me with a good understanding of how these things apply within my own society and culture, I have enough experience to know that things are somewhat different elsewhere. I am still quite confident that the Bible has the answers for all men, all ages, all ways; but I am quite aware that I do not understand all the depths in the scriptures on all these points. I am trusting the Lord to help us both to find what He put there for us on the questions at hand.</p>

<p>The Bible tells us, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+4%3A1" title="I&nbsp;John 4:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 4:1)</span></a></span>
It is a mistake to assume or extend naked faith with no evidence to go on. This situation of looking for the fingerprints of God in a man&#8217;s heart is not a case of &#8220;innocent until proven guilty.&#8221; It is a case of seeing what is and what is not established. The Bible tells to <span class="scripture">&#8220;Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+5%3A21" title="I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:21)</span></a></span> Again, <span class="scripture">&#8220;And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+12%3A2" title="Romans 12:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 12:2)</span></a></span> You will note in this last verse that there is an establishing, a transforming, a renewing that is needed in us to make it possible to prove what is good, acceptable, and perfect, will of God. In other words, we must have it to recognize it. And we must have it established in us to where it proves to be more than a passing thing, and then recognize that same process of qualification of each person that He saves, and we must wait and be witnesses of this in others.</p>

<p>To put this thought in the words of the parable of the sower, no person has any business taking on the position of a leader to the others until they have borne a crop in the field of their own heart. Merely putting down root is not enough. Merely looking promising is not enough. There must be fruit, recognizable fruit; not just buds or blossoms. <span class="scripture">&#8220;The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A6" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 2:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 2:6)</span></a></span> Note the authority of this verse. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Must be first.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>A brother was saved from being an alcoholic. Immediately he felt a burden to preach. His conversion and deliverance was real and beyond doubt, but he was advised to wait a year by brethren who were aware of God&#8217;s qualification plan. He did so, and God blessed him. Recently he died after many years of laboring for the Master as an evangelist. The brethren who advised him were standing on the Word of God. They were following the Bible. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Lay hands suddenly on no man.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+5%3A22" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 5:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 5:22)</span></a></span> This laying on of hands is no more or less than recognition of what God has already done, and we are here advised to go about it slowly and not do it suddenly. The gift should prove itself. The steadfastness of the individual should prove out. Time must be given for the proving.</p>

<p>I watched a minister violate this scriptural counsel. He was an older minister, and the deliverance of the young man under consideration seemed past doubting. The older brother had some misgiving (he should have stayed his hand), and he expressed himself that there had only been three months since the young brother had been saved and sanctified, but he said that the blessing on the young brother was so great that he felt he should go ahead. It had precisely the effect of <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+3%3A6">I&nbsp;Timothy 3:6</a> in due time. Today, he is the head of a fanatical movement after leading a split in that group of people where he was ordained.</p>

<p>We do not know until it is too late to know just what is in each other&#8217;s hearts a good part of the time. God has not designed for us to just discern immediately all of the time. He has designed for us to trust Him. We might say that in this business of extending or not extending fellowship, trust in God is the first thing, trust in God is the second thing, trust in God is the third thing, and right on&#8212;it is trust in God all the way. It is having a loyalty and trueness to what God has got over to us that we will not attempt to negotiate or rationalize. If the other fellow does not see it the same way, we wait on God and trust Him to bring us together. If the other fellow does not see salvation as the end of sin in the life with real deliverance, then we simply recognize that we are not the same. No matter whether he is sincere or not, it is not the same. We are not standing on the same basis. This goes deeper than whether he says it exactly the same; it depends on what the actions of his life reveal about his heart&#8217;s condition. We wait on God to bring it out.</p>

<p>This is the principle that Jesus told the disciples. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us. But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me. For he that is not against us is on our part.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+9%3A38-40" title="Mark 9:38-40"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 9:38-40)</span></a></span> People who have done business with God to the extent that His grace has regenerated their hearts cannot lightly speak evil of Jesus. That is because there is a real love for God right in there. I had better leave such folks in God&#8217;s hands, and extend confidence gradually as the evidence piles up that God is really in them and using them.</p>

<p>With respect to people who are not delivered from Babylonian tendencies and who have a secret idol (perhaps secret even to themselves) in their hearts, I would like to mention this scripture in Isaiah: <span class="scripture">&#8220;And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord&#8217;s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+2%3A2" title="Isaiah 2:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 2:2)</span></a></span> This flowing is completely contrary to nature, for it is all <b>uphill</b> to the top of the mountains. Also, for people to flow <b>together</b> in this manner, they must <b>melt</b>. There are a whole lot of things that can only work in the Bible pattern if the <b>melting</b> occurs. Peter melted before he went to Cornelius&#8217; house. I suspect that Cornelius did his melting before he got to the point of sending for Peter. He and others there were so melted before God that the Holy Ghost fell upon them during the message. It was a meeting of great melting down before God. What happens in our hearts in these meltings make it possible for us to <b>flow</b> together <b>up</b> to where God would have us&#8212;to what He has prepared for His melted people. Unity without melting is merely union&#8212;pounded together, tied together, bound together. But Holy Spirit melting!&#8212;Praise God, it just melts us down with great abba&#8217;s in our heart to God and His ways, and we flow together upwards.</p>

<p>Brother, ask God to so fill you with His Spirit and His truth, and to so melt you before that truth that you will hold it up continually before everyone. Those who want it will seek God for it, and those who do not will persecute and trouble you, but God will bring it out all the clearer in those tribulations. Let us buy (only) the truth and sell it not. Nor discount it. Nor exaggerate it. It is just right all by itself. God knew what He was doing when He put it all together.</p>

<p>I feel burdened to present one more thought on this subject. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Kings+6%3A7" title="I&nbsp;Kings 6:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Kings 6:7)</span></a></span> This was spoken of the temple which Solomon built, which was a shadow of the temple of our hearts for a habitation of the Spirit today. There <span class="scripture">&#8220;was neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.&#8221;</span> With that scripture, let us read: <span class="scripture">&#8220;And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A24-26" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 2:24-26"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 2:24-26)</span></a></span> Here is lack of the noise of strife. <span class="scripture">&#8220;In meekness.&#8221;</span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;Gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient.&#8221;</span> Waiting for the work of God to be done off premises, so to speak, in the hearts of the individuals in need of help.</p>

<p>A pastor had a situation in his congregation like this: after every Sunday, a certain sister took it upon herself to privately criticize the message to everyone who would listen to her thoughout the week. It was quite effective at destroying the burden of the message. He had borne with this quite a while, and arrived at the conclusion that he had a Bible right to go to her (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+18%3A15-17">Matthew 18:15-17</a>). So he got in his car and started to her house. As he drove, the Lord spoke to him and said, &#8220;You do have a right to go to her, but if you do, it will destroy her.&#8221; He pulled over by the side of the road. After meditating about this for a while, he made a U-turn and went back home. He continued preaching, praying, bearing, and forebearing as before.</p>

<p>Dear brother, be true to God and to the souls of the people. Tell them the truth in love. Suffer yourself to be the offscouring of the earth; your rights to be trampled. Entreat with all longsuffering and doctrine. Will not He who waits for us at the end of our course be pleased if we thus labor in His vineyard at His direction? Leave the results with Him, and give yourself completely to God, to be used of Him as He sees fit. Whether a vessel of suffering or lightly esteemed, it matters not, as long as He is pleased. If the people hold you up, pray to be hidden behind the cross.</p>

<p>A final thought from Brother C. E. Orr&#8217;s writings:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Two men went to hear a preacher preach one Sunday morning. One said to the other after the preaching, &#8220;That was an eloquent discourse; he is a wonderful preacher.&#8221; In the evening they went to hear another preacher. After the services one said to the other, &#8220;What a wonderful Savior is Jesus.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The whole question of acceptance of others comes down to this: Does God accept them? Has He qualified them for what they are attempting to do? (That is, are they in His order?) Perhaps they are saved, and we should recognize that fact, but they are not taught of God in other matters yet. We must wait on God to teach them and establish them. We must do the part He lays upon our hearts while we wait.</p>

<p>I will answer the letter on divorce and remarriage as soon as possible.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p class="noindent">Dear Bro. &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;,</p>

<p>In our day, we understand marriage to mean the union of a man and a woman to be husband and wife from the time they take vows of consecration to each other until death dissolves the union. We do not consider the couple to be married before these vows are taken. We label sexual impurity before the vows are taken as fornication. We label sexual impurity after the vows are taken as adultery. We do not understand the engagement period before the marriage vows are taken to be a part of the marriage, but a time prior to being actually married.</p>

<p>However, the Jews at the time of the New Testament did consider that pre-marriage engagement period to be part of the marriage, and they considered that dissolving of that engagement bond to be a putting away. Accordingly, we read, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily. But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+1%3A18-20" title="Matthew 1:18-20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 1:18-20)</span></a></span> Notice that Mary and Joseph were not married as we understand marriage. She was espoused (engaged) to Joseph. They had not come together. The angel told him not to be afraid to take unto him <span class="scripture">&#8220;Mary thy wife&#8221;</span>; and he was called <span class="scripture">&#8220;her husband.&#8221;</span> Yet, by our standards, they were not married, but simply promised to be married. It appeared (although it was not as it appeared) that she was guilty of fornication, and he was minded to put her away privily. To our minds, the period of espousal, or engagement, is not as binding as these folks regarded it, but to them it was, and to break it was a solemn step, entitled, &#8220;to put her away.&#8221;</p>

<p>I will here quote from an article on the subject which addresses the original scriptural words for fornication and adultery:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first"><span class="scripture">&#8220;And I say unto you, whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication and shall marry another, committeth adultery; and whoso marrieth her which is put away, doth commit adultery.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+19%3A9" title="Matthew 19:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 19:9)</span></a></span> If the verse is read at first omitting the parenthetical phrase, <span class="scripture">&#8220;except it be for fornication,&#8221;</span> it will be seen that divorce and remarriage are forbidden in the strongest terms. What a volume of sin and wickedness has been excused with that little parenthetical phrase! We note the exception rests with the word <i>fornication</i>, while the word <i>adultery</i> occurs twice later on in the same verse. Exactly the same thing is true in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+5%3A32">Matthew 5:32</a>. We are forced to conclude then that there is a definite distinction in the use of the two words <i>fornication</i> and <i>adultery</i>. The consultation of any reputable English dictionary will show that <i>fornication</i> means &#8220;illegitimate sex relation on the part of an unmarried person,&#8221; while <i>adultery</i> means &#8220;illegitimate sex relation on the part of a married person.&#8221;</p>

<p>A study of the Greek words which these English words are used to translate will show about the same meanings, with the difference that <i>porneia</i> (fornication) widens out on some occasions to mean general unchastity. However, when in this verse Christ uses it in contradistinction to <i>moikeia</i> (adultery), we are compelled to the conclusion that it is used in its specific sense of premarital impurity.</p>

<p>A simple illustration will aid us in understanding the issue. The word <i>man</i> has both a specific and a general meaning. Specifically it means the male of the human species; in general it means the whole of the genus <i>homo</i>. The context will always reveal whether it is used in its general or its specific sense. If the word <i>man</i> is used in the same sentence with the word <i>woman</i>, one is sure that it is used in its specific and not in its general sense.</p>

<p>So it is with <i>porneia</i> and <i>moikeia</i>. When these words are used together they denote a contrast and no amount of sophistry or obscurantism can make them synonymous or interchangeable. Fornication here simply does not mean adultery unless words have lost their meaning, and it is a reflection if not an insult to the omniscient Son of God to insinuate that He was unable to express Himself clearly in such an important statement. If He had intended to make adultery a ground for divorce under His law He could very easily have said so. When He meant <i>moikeia</i> (adultery), He said, &#8220;Moikeia.&#8221;</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[Graham, James B., Jr.; <a href="../../../texts/Divorce_and_Marriage/index.html"><i>Divorce and Marriage</i></a>, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Divorce_and_Marriage/Demon_of_Divorce/index.html">Demon of Divorce</a>&#8221;]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>I have attached the entire article to this email for you to read. Since the phrase <span class="scripture">&#8220;except for fornication&#8221;</span> applies to the what we understand to be the engagement or espousal time, then it follows that there is no scriptural grounds whatsoever for dissolving the marriage bond until death does so.</p>

<p>The question: &#8220;Is it [the saint&#8217;s] stand that one should live with the spouse in spite of adultery/fornication?&#8221;</p>

<p>This question does not attempt the dissolving of the marriage, but questions how a marriage in trouble should be conducted.</p>

<p>If my wife should leave me and become the (illegal) wife of another man or divorce me and (illegally in the eyes of God, but legally in the eyes of the civil law of the country in which I reside) marry another, I am still her rightful husband, and have no right to marry anyone else until she has died. As a practical working relationship, my marriage is dead, but I am not released from my marriage vows by her sin. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth? For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+7%3A1-3" title="Romans 7:1-3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 7:1-3)</span></a></span> As long as she is alive and I am alive, we are husband and wife. As to the duties and responsibilities of a husband while she is false to her marriage vows: <span class="scripture">&#8220;And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband: But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife. But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away. And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy. But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+7%3A10-15" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 7:10-15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 7:10-15)</span></a></span> I must keep an open door; I must desire a reconciliation. She is still my wife, although she has defiled our marriage. As to the reconciliation, it may not be possible to share a marriage bed after infidelity because of disease. It may not be possible to live in the same house because of the nature of sin in the life of the one unsaved and the effect on other members of the household, yet <b>she is still my wife</b> until death do us part, and I must pray and find what my responsibilities are under the current conditions and do them with the Lord&#8217;s help.</p>

<p>As you can see, brother, this question of &#8220;living with the spouse&#8221; involves quite a bit more than the question of attempting to dissolve the marriage.</p>

<p>I know a couple who have been separated for years because of infidelity on the husband&#8217;s part. He was a minister, fell, and committed adultery with their niece. He married this girl, but later, she divorced him and married a younger man. Then he lived single. Eventually, he got back to God, and then he attempted to woo his wife. She had remained saved and chaste. She could not find grounds to take him back. There were other questions than the adultery offense, which had ended. She questioned some of his business dealings, etc. It all added up to a lack of confidence, as far as we can see. Whether there is more to it (a lack of forgiveness, etc.), only God knows. They remain apart, but know that they are married until death part the marriage bond.</p>

<p>I have been with other ministers who counseled wrongfully-married couples to part. They were advised to immediately stop living together as husband and wife. They were counseled to pray and look to God to help them untangle their financial affairs, including property, money, etc. To give time for the children to adjust. But they had no right to each other, and must needs steer away from each other until there was no longer a reproach.</p>

<p>It is a Bible standard, brother, that marriage is for &#8220;till death doth part us.&#8221; I am sorry to say that the land is full of adultery, just as we read about in the Bible (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+23%3A14">Jeremiah 23:14</a>). This scripture covers the comment of the minister-missionary who defended second marriages while one has yet a living companion. As to the sad philosophy expounded to defend his sin, the Word says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+5%3A10" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 5:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 5:10)</span></a></span> This minister-missionary says that what we do here in the flesh should not therefore be taken as influencing life after death, but the Bible says that we will <span class="scripture">&#8220;appear before the judgment seat of Christ [to] receive the things done in the body.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>The question: &#8220;Do we disfellowship those who marry women who are put away?&#8221;</p>

<p>Every minute spent in a state of adultery is continually committing of adultery. So, &#8220;Do we disfellowship those who sin?&#8221; We don&#8217;t have to do anything but recognize the fact that they are not walking in the light as He is in the light (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1%3A7">I&nbsp;John 1:7</a>). Fellowship is automatically broken by sin. We began to pray for them to be delivered as we would any other kind of sin. If you accept them as ministers or brothers or sisters in the Lord when you know what they are doing, you will become a partaker of their sin and not be pure yourself before God.</p>

<p>In reply to the ways that people marry&#8212;non-Christian or even non-civil&#8212;that we call in this country &#8220;common law marriages.&#8221; In this state, I think, about ten years of living together will cause you to be recognized by the state as married. More and more, in this country that is losing what virtue it has had, people just take up living together. They don&#8217;t even try to get parent&#8217;s permission or anything&#8212;just cohabit. And they break up and live with someone else, many times dragging around and scarring little children and bigger children.</p>

<p>The Bible has very little to say about just exactly where the line is when people actually begin a marriage. It recognizes an illicit union between man and woman when fornication is committed (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+6%3A16">I&nbsp;Corinthians 6:16</a>). But it is obvious that this does not mean they become married. It seems that the Bible recognizes the great diversity of ways that people approach this business of committing to each other, with all that comes from it&#8212;what we term <i>marriage</i>. If two people just start living with each other, all the things that should be committed to up front start taking place little by little, step by step. The two become more and more entwined in their lives&#8212;children, everything. Even the world calls them &#8220;significant others.&#8221; A term I dislike, because it signifies that they have gone at it backwards. But the point is this: salvation brings about a great recognition of reality&#8212;sober-thinking. I must face what I have done and what it means. I must do the right thing. Maybe that means that I recognize that I have someone else&#8217;s companion, and I have ruined my right to take a companion by how I have lived. To get clear and do right, I must move away from wrong and do what is honorable and upright. If I have a right to my companion, I need to do the honorable thing and take vows before others. Perhaps they are vows I have already been doing to some extent, but it is aboveboard and proper to formally and publicly acknowledge and consecrate to the highest standard of light and truth that I perceive.</p>

<p>When I get to this thought, brother, I am strongly reminded of the uplifting effect that (true) Christianity has! Surely it raises a man to heavenly places in Christ Jesus to follow the gospel! God melts us so that we can flow upwards!</p>

<p>On another note, we are particularly interested in testimonies of deliverance that you are aware of, both in your life and the lives of those around you. We want to scatter the news far and wide of God&#8217;s saving power.</p>

<p>I trust and pray that these thoughts will be enlarged and taught by the Holy Spirit in a way that is profitable to you. I wish to say that I believe God knows how to get us to heaven, and He will get us there if we let Him. Brother, we are not the least disturbed by your questions. We, too, are seekers for truth.</p>

<h1>The Process of Maturity</h1>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+13%3A11" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 13:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 13:11)</span></a></span></p>

<p>God has designed that we all come into life as a child. The only two human beings who ever avoided this childish existence were Adam and Eve. They were not created as children. God created them as mature adults. But for everyone else, He made it so that we all experience life as children.</p>

<p>This childish condition is distinguished from adulthood by a number of characteristics.</p>

<h3>God made us so that we need governing, teaching, and training.</h3>
<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+4%3A1-2" title="Galatians 4:1-2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 4:1-2)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+22%3A6" title="Proverbs 22:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 22:6)</span></a></span></p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>In these perilous times in which we live, many children are left to fend for themselves, and they do indeed bring their mothers, fathers, and all of the rest of us to shame by their ungodly deeds. From time to time, these poor, foolish children break out in acts of spectacular savagery which warn all who will pay attention of the awful cost of ignoring the realities portrayed in the scriptures quoted above. A large portion of this problem can be traced to parents who never really matured themselves. They are still just as self-centered as the children are. A lot of the extreme problems we experience today are the result of children raising children.</p>

<p>We are burdened to focus on the process of maturity. What does it mean to train a child <span class="scripture">&#8220;in the way he should go&#8221;</span>? What is a mature person, anyway? I am reminded of one man who intercepted a note from his sixteen-year-old daughter to a friend of hers. It read, &#8220;I think I&#8217;m mature. Don&#8217;t you think that you are mature?&#8221; Whereupon the father commented, &#8220;I wondered if I were mature at forty!&#8221;</p>

<p>What does it mean to join the ranks of the grownups? In outward, physical life, the evidences of maturity are easy to recognize. Puberty brings its changes, and the boy begins to appear as a man; the girl as a woman. They put away childish things, i.e., the toys that were their learning tools, to experiment with life, and began to take up the things of adulthood. Formal schooling is concluded. The young man earns his first pay. Wherein there is wisdom and proper understanding, the young woman takes on more responsibility for the care of children and domestic duties in some capacity. These are the more obvious changes.</p>

<p>There are less obvious changes taking place. As the poet said, &#8220;I slept and dreamed that life was beauty. I awoke and found that life was duty.&#8221; Idealism is replaced by necessity, and the young idealist begins to learn that life is largely about survival and coping, rather than the careful formulation and accomplishment of dreams and plans.</p>

<p>Most of all, there is an awakening toward God that is different than the awareness in childhood. The acceptance of responsibility brings with it a deepening sense of what it means to be a man or woman before God.</p>

<p>Now God has designed all of this to work in this way. And He designed it so that the change to a certain extent is involuntary, but He also designed that we should embrace and choose to grow up. That is, it is our privilege to participate voluntarily with the full consent of our will. <span class="scripture">&#8220;When I became a man, <b>I put away</b> childish things.&#8221;</span> One of the characteristics of maturity is to decide to be mature&#8212;and to translate that decision into grownup deeds. To seek out and bear responsibility. To police one&#8217;s self. To enter the world of men or the world of women as one of them. To appreciate and respect the weight and privilege of being an adult human being among other adult human beings.</p>

<p>Now this process is remarkably uneven. The young person seems only partly a young adult; he is a boy-man or a man-boy, and she is a girl-woman or woman-girl. They are only partly baked, and this is a frustration to those who have borne the responsibility of them all of their lives and, most of all, to the young person maturing. No wonder that the adolescent years are the most unstable of life! How easy it would be if it could all be settled in one day! But it cannot. Much patience is needed. The young person must be patient with the process taking place inside. The older folks must be patient, too. Fretting will not help. No one takes on this load of responsibility and does it without mistakes. There is much room for humility, as well.</p>

<p>There needs to be <b>a mutual recognition for adjustment</b>. A significant part of the maturity process is acceptance and appreciation of the responsibility that the parents have borne so long. This is a difficult thing for the young person, not that they are ungrateful in many cases, but simply that it is hard for them to see. In fact, they don&#8217;t really see it in its true light until they have raised their own. But the aspiring young adult must begin to see, to peck out of the shell of his/her self-centeredness, so to speak. It means a great deal to say, &#8220;My parents were right to spank me and reprove me. I deserved it and needed it, and I am so glad that they did.&#8221; It is a definite step toward growing up. A young man or woman who embraces their past in this way is getting rid of some more of the foolishness that was bound up in them as a child.</p>

<p>But I said, &#8220;a mutual recognition.&#8221; Mom and Dad have a right to keep treating the young person as a child <b>in any particular area</b> until the young person begins to plainly demonstrate that he/she is not childish in that area. The unevenness of growing up produces an unevenness of oversight which is just as frustrating to Mom and Dad as to the young person. If a young person concludes that Mother and Daddy just don&#8217;t understand where I am, and then rebels against what he/she views as an unfair oversight, then the lesson of waiting on God will be missed. I am aware that parents have problems, and there are overbearing, dictatorial parents who are unfair and even abusive. I am also thankfully aware that God can handle anybody, and that one cannot go wrong by committing one&#8217;s case to God and waiting patiently for Him.</p>

<p>Some might say, &#8220;I can hardly wait until I am an adult and can do as I please.&#8221; To them, being grownup is defined as doing as I please. It is not like that, and the keys to respectable maturity are forged in the struggles to put away childish things.</p>

<h1>I Shall Never Be Moved</h1>

<p>Instability. It is everywhere around us. From homes that have been shattered by mistrust and lost values, to the doubts and temptations that daily assail those that seek to live right before God, the <span class="scripture">&#8220;power of the air&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+2%3A2" title="Ephesians 2:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 2:2)</span></a></span> is set to overthrow us. The course for heaven is a narrow one and the devil knows that to get us one step off the rock is to stage our downfall. He would beguile us with a multitude of &#8220;custom-made&#8221; deceptions. The cares and troubles of life entangle our thoughts and drag us downward. The temptations of this world tug at us and would, like the wind, carry us along. We need an anchor&#8212;desperately. The following scripture was impressed upon me several years ago, but the weathering of time only has proved its enduring qualities. Though this truth is costly to obtain, it has kept me through many storms.&#8212;L.E.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3><u>I</u> have set the Lord always before me</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m the one responsible for me. It is my will that runs the engine of what I will do, and the choices I make that direct my course. I can not shove this responsibility on others, neither can I be the propeller of another&#8217;s life. None can hold sway in my life without me allowing it. And in the end I will be judged according to my own actions, words, and thoughts. Therefore, what I do is crucial.</p>

<h3>I <u>have set</u> the Lord always before me</h3>
<p>My action is that of the will. My feelings or the circumstances will not be allowed play in this. To have set is a past action, preceding all I do and say and the decisions I make. It is a determination as well as a yielding position, a self-imposed but self-disposed act. I can fall back on it, yet it must be continually renewed. The object of the setting is what plays the vital role in the results.</p>

<h3>I have set <u>the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span></u> always before me</h3>
<p>He who is both my Creator, Redeemer, and Master. All that is good comes from Him, for He is goodness and blessing in His very presence. His overwhelming interest and sacrifice for me is reason enough for my complete trust. He is everything a heart can desire, yet marvelously greater and wiser than human comprehension. Here is my vision to keep going, for He never will forsake. Here is a strength to hold to, for He stands unmovable. Here is something to depend on, for His way alone is best. He crosses my natural man, yet extends the sweetest rest to the soul, for He teaches of a victory that triumphs even over death.</p>

<h3>I have set the Lord <u>always</u> before me</h3>
<p>With no exceptions. An absolute that is seldom found in the history of a fickle race, we who are so prone to an unstable, undisciplined, feelings way of life. In all ways is to make neither preference of type or time or place, but to do it none the less. When my feelings are dull and uninspired, I will; or my thoughts are fearful in a flutter of what may come, I will; or the mountains and valleys seem impossible to traverse, I will. Though it be loss to me, or gain, I stand aloof of the consequence and stay my course on an &#8220;always&#8221; that I trust more than myself.</p>

<h3>I have set the Lord always <u>before me</u></h3>
<p>First to be considered in all matters. He stands in front of the &#8220;me&#8221; in life. Dreams held dear, aspirations of attainment, desires for the best, personal interests, and whatever else concerns me must take the hidden place in His shadow. His mind is sought before my own, His perspective is considered superior, and His life become the sole aim. As we set a captain or pilot at the helm of a mission, so is He at the helm of my life. The leader that takes the brunt of all force and opposition, who selects the route and provides the protection and necessities, who holds the responsibility as well as the glory, must necessarily go before.</p>

<h3><span class="scripture">&#8220;&#8230;&#8203;because he is at my right hand, I shall never be moved.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+16%3A8" title="Psalm 16:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 16:8)</span></a></span></h3>
</blockquote>


<p>Is this your stand? Can you say of yourself, &#8220;I determine to have no one but the King of heaven rule my life&#8212;He bought me with His life and He&#8217;s due to have my all&#8221;? It is not only the happiest and most fulfilled way to live; it is the only safe way to live. I mean to press on for that high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Will you do the same?</p>

<h1>&#8220;I Write unto You, Young Men&#8221;</h1>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first"><span class="scripture">&#8220;I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+2%3A14" title="I&nbsp;John 2:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 2:14)</span></a></span></p>
</div>


<hr class="minor" />
<p>In an earlier issue I wrote about King David&#8217;s charge to his son Solomon to <span class="scripture">&#8220;shew theyself a man.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Kings+2%3A2" title="I&nbsp;Kings 2:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Kings 2:2)</span></a></span> By the help of the Lord, I want to write now about the period after David&#8217;s death, described as follows: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Kings+2%3A12" title="I&nbsp;Kings 2:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Kings 2:12)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Kings+2%3A46" title="I&nbsp;Kings 2:46"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Kings 2:46)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Between these two scriptures lies a description of what Solomon had to do in order for the kingdom to be established. In brief, he dealt with four threats to the establishment of his kingdom: Adonijah, Abiathar, Joab, and Shimei. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+1%3A13" title="Colossians 1:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 1:13)</span></a></span> A part of the process of being established in <span class="scripture">&#8220;the kingdom of his dear Son&#8221;</span> is by removing threats from our lives. Let us examine these one at a time, and see what lessons the Lord has for us in establishing His kingdom in our hearts.</p>

<p>Adonijah is best described by his stated ambition: <span class="scripture">&#8220;I will be king.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Kings+1%3A5" title="I&nbsp;Kings 1:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Kings 1:5)</span></a></span> His self-will had never been contested by his father (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Kings+1%3A6">I&nbsp;Kings 1:6</a>), and as his father was old and stricken in years, but not yet dead, he carried out his plot to rebel and take the kingdom. His father proved able to quash this rebellion before it gained substance, and Adonijah submitted (apparently) meekly to Solomon&#8217;s authority. However, we find that the spirit <span class="scripture">&#8220;I will be king&#8221;</span> was still there, seeking opportunity through subtle means to undermine his brother Solomon&#8217;s authority in the eyes of the people and to establish his own. Solomon recognized the spirit behind the supposedly harmless request he sent through Bathsheba, and had him put to death.</p>

<p>After we get saved, as we seek to be established in God&#8217;s kingdom, the Lord will show us that our &#8220;Adonijah&#8221; self, though outwardly obeying to God&#8217;s rule, remains a foe to the establishment of God&#8217;s kingdom. The particular things in us that must &#8220;die&#8221; will very from individual to individual&#8212;but there will be something that is the manifestation of the old life that still wants to rule. It will be such a natural part of us and our thinking, and the devil will be so cunning in justifying it, that we will need the Lord&#8217;s help and a real determination to have God&#8217;s kingdom established to recognize and put to death whatever it is. I had a long battle with my desire to reserve control of my destiny and my family&#8217;s destiny. You may say that God is so much bigger than us, and so much is out of our control anyway, how could I think such ridiculous thoughts? And yet God showed me this &#8220;desire&#8221; was a poison in my vitals, keeping me from being launched out into God. It is true that as parents we carry a solemn responsibility to protect and nurture our children, but I am speaking of a quality that will argue with anything God puts in our path that does not seem like a good idea to me. There are trials the Lord has brought me through in the past few years in which I would have given up my integrity (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Job+2%3A9-10">Job 2:9-10</a>) if I had not laid this desire on an altar before the Lord as a &#8220;burnt offering.&#8221;</p>

<p>Abiathar had been loyal to David in all his afflictions and trouble, even loyally helping him at risk of his own life under Absalom&#8217;s rebellion, but at the very last, he turned aside and joined in Adonijah&#8217;s rebellion. There are qualities in us, perhaps strengths in our character, that have served us well many times, but will prove our undoing if we let them remain in a place of eminence and honor in our hearts.</p>

<p>I knew a man who had developed an abundance of patience in his character. He was much more &#8220;naturally&#8221; patient than I, and I watched with some awe and wonder over the years at the amount of difficulties and burdens he put up with in his home life. His wife was an unstable person and brought many troubles into his life. She even became unfaithful, and he bore that. But something had begun to collapse inside him. He did not have enough to wait out her rebellion. A time came when she repented, but though he spoke of forgiveness, he had no grace to contemplate having her be his wife again. He had leaned on his own virtue, and not the Lord&#8217;s inexhaustible supply. May the Lord help you to recognize your own strengths as simply human strengths, and learn early to depend on the Lord, and not your own _______ (fill in with wisdom, understanding, strength, ability, patience, etc.).</p>

<p>Joab had been loyal to David just as long, if not longer than Abiathar. He had faithfully served David as his general most of that time, and many times been a great help to him, but his harsh, unforgiving nature had been a cause of trouble to David a number of times, most particularly in the matter of the deaths of Abner, Amasa and Absalom. David summarized the problem in this way: <span class="scripture">&#8220;these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Samuel+3%3A39" title="II&nbsp;Samuel 3:39"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Samuel 3:39)</span></a></span> In the end, his very hard-heartedness had led him to despise David&#8217;s leadership and join in Adonijah&#8217;s rebellion. When it became evident that Adonijah could not be trusted, Joab had to go as well.</p>

<p>We very much need the determination to fight the Lord&#8217;s battles through to victory, but there is a hardness and mercilessness that easily comes with that will to win. <span class="scripture">&#8220;I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name&#8217;s sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted. Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+2%3A2-5" title="Revelation 2:2-5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 2:2-5)</span></a></span> We need the love and mercy of God continually refreshed in us, or we will become carnal fighters. <span class="scripture">&#8220;For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+1%3A20" title="James 1:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 1:20)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Shimei was described thus by David: <span class="scripture">&#8220;And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the Lord, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword. Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Kings+2%3A8-9" title="I&nbsp;Kings 2:8-9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Kings 2:8-9)</span></a></span> Solomon dealt with him by keeping him under close watch, saying: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither. For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Kings+2%3A36-37" title="I&nbsp;Kings 2:36-37"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Kings 2:36-37)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Let me suggest to you that there is a close line to be drawn between sober and honest dealings in our own hearts and a spirit of accusation prompted by the devil. If we make mistakes in judgment that bring trouble in our lives, the devil will jump all over us, making it out to be sin, bringing up past sins that God has forgiven, and trying to crush us with discouragement and despair. Even if we have sinned, and need to acknowledge it and repent and get back to God, this spirit will endeavor to make us wallow in sorrow and despair, instead of taking action to get right with God. We must be humble enough to receive correction from the Lord, but there must be a tight rein kept against a false, accusing spirit from the devil getting loose. <span class="scripture">&#8220;But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man&#8217;s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self. For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+4%3A3-4" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 4:3-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 4:3-4)</span></a></span> We will only be established when the Lord is our judge, and not other men, nay, not even our own selves. When questionings and doubts about our standing or the rightness of our actions or course come to mind, we must submit them to the Lord, and take a stand against holding conversations with the devil. Sometimes I have had to stand thus: &#8220;Lord, I am willing to make anything right that you say I need to make right, or repent of anything that you say is wrong, but right now I&#8217;m under attack and I need relief. At a time when I can think calmly, will you please make it plain to my soul if I need to do anything about this?&#8221; The devil will undertake to run our spiritual lives if we give him room. We must keep ourselves out of his hands, and safely in the hands of the Lord.</p>

<p>Dear reader, is the kingdom of God fully established in you? Is there &#8220;unfinished business&#8221; between you and the Lord, things that threaten the kingdom from within? Let the Lord have His way fully with you. Remember that while those under the Old Covenant found physical violence necessary, we under the New Covenant will find spiritual violence necessary. <span class="scripture">&#8220;The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+11%3A12" title="Matthew 11:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 11:12)</span></a></span></p>

<div class="center"><img src="../../Foundation_Truth_12/battle_ships.jpg" alt="The Battle of the Atlantic" title="The Battle of the Atlantic" width="720" height="345" /></div>
<p>In the contest between the Allied and Axis powers in World War II, a great battle developed over the supply lines which crossed the Atlantic Ocean. The Allies&#8217; ships brought both the military supplies and the essentials of life to Europe, most particularly from the United States to Britain. Against the supply lines were pitted the U-boats, surface raiders (battleships, cruisers and other warships), and airplanes of Hitler&#8217;s Germany, in an ongoing effort to sink the ships that were carrying the supplies before they could bring them to their destination. This great conflict became known as &#8220;The Battle of the Atlantic.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a long time, the ships were sunk much faster than they could be built, not only preventing the immediate supplies needed from reaching their destinations in the quantities needed, but threatening to destroy the ability to supply at all. First the British, and then later the Americans, thought they had the problem in hand, but discovered they hadn&#8217;t, and had to learn various ways to overcome this opposition and keep the lifeline going. They armed the merchant ships, and used escort vessels with guns and depth charges, and equipped them with ASDIC (an early form of underwater detection, similar to SONAR used later). They grouped the ships into convoys, protected by groups of armed escorts. Wherever possible, they provided support with aircraft, also equipped with depth charges. They sought to break the secret code in which messages were sent to and from the U-boat commanders, and they re-routed convoys to avoid areas where U-boats were known to be. Finally, the industry of the United States and Britain was focused to build ships faster than they could be sunk.</p>

<p>The enemy never gave up, and each time some improvement in defenses was developed, a way to overcome the new defense was sought. The U-boats would move to new locations, to attack where the convoys could not be protected by airplanes, and they formed in groups called &#8220;Wolf Packs&#8221; to break into large convoys. In the end, only constant effort and vigilance made possible the victory.</p>

<p>Friends, this is not at all unlike the battle against our life-line to the Lord. How many strategies the enemy of our soul has to cut off our prayer and meditation upon God&#8217;s Word! How cunning and merciless He is. But our Lord&#8217;s &#8220;intelligence&#8221; of enemy movements is perfect, and if we are diligent to mind the checks and receive His corrections in our &#8220;movements,&#8221; He will enable us to keep the lifeline open.</p>

<p>In <i>Hinds&#8217; Feet on High Places</i>, an allegory of Hannah Hurnard&#8217;s own spiritual journey to the &#8220;high places,&#8221; we find the following conversation between Much-Afraid and the Shepherd:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">&#8220;Shepherd,&#8221; asked Much-Afraid earnestly, &#8220;tell me why I nearly got into Pride&#8217;s clutches again, and why Resentment, Bitterness, and Self-Pity have been able to pester me for so long in this dreadful way. I did not call you before, because they never dared to come close to me or to make a real attack, but they have been lurking around all the time and making their horrible suggestions, and I couldn&#8217;t get away from them. Why was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said the Shepherd gently, &#8220;that lately the way seemed a little easier and the sun shone, and you came to a place where you could rest. You forgot for a while that you were my little handmaiden Acceptance-with-Joy and were beginning to tell yourself it really was time that I led you back to the mountains and up to the High Places. When you wear the weed of impatience in your heart instead of the flower Acceptance-with-Joy, you will always find your enemies get an advantage over you.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The Lord will show us, if we seek His help, the places that our &#8220;convoys&#8221; need re-routing, and when we need to make greater efforts to build the supply line. In my own life, the Lord shows me when things are draining away my spiritual appetite or places where traps are laid for my soul. If you and I place no confidence in our own wisdom, and pay close attention to our Lord&#8217;s direction, we will prosper and win the victory!</p>

<h1>Babies&#8212;God&#8217;s Little Vessels</h1>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Foundation_Truth_12/babies_a.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="124" /></div>
<p>One of God&#8217;s little vessels was in our midst for almost a year. We did not expect the permanent guardianship to be terminated. It seemed everything was on our side, and that the best interest of the child would prevail. We didn&#8217;t know God&#8217;s appointment for her would end so soon. It seemed almost everyone in the court room was shocked that the verdict would be to take her from the stable environment she had enjoyed her first year. She was a happy, well-adjusted baby, yet very wary of strangers. But it had been prayed that God would cause the judge to speak God&#8217;s will for the baby. We wanted God to have His way even if it hurt.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Foundation_Truth_12/babies_b.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="109" /></div>
<p>As we recovered from the shock and started dealing with the reality of it all, we asked, why must she suffer so? She won&#8217;t understand! There was no possible way to communicate our love, care, and great concern for her welfare to one so young! She had won our hearts by her sweet innocent smiles and affection given. She was just learning to walk. She was articulating that little tongue, and many sounds were beginning to form words. How delightful to watch a little one learn and grow! And now she must go away. What would her future be like? How hard the anticipation of parting! Tears, sleepless hours, praying for forgiveness of the unjustness to the child.</p>

<p>We were confident God was watching over all. The sad day arrived&#8212;Resurrection Sunday; there were weekend guests at services. It was still our Gethsemane. The text of the Sunday school lesson was in Rev. 19:6-9, &#8220;fine linen is the righteousness of saints.&#8221; It was brought out that it is hard in great tribulation to keep your robes washed, but we must! We must be free from any resentment or bitterness. Then the second message was taken from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+1%3A14-20">Mark 1:14-20</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8220;The time is fulfilled.&#8221;</span> We can dip in the stream of righteousness. How all of the prayers of the saints helped in that hour. The Lord knows how to draw all His people together. Around 1:00 p.m. our family all drove to meet the new parents at the appointed place. It was raining&#8212;it seemed God was crying too. As we rode along, our minds went back over the past year and it&#8217;s happenings: the attempted kidnapping, how God helped then and protected, how the promises of God really came alive. One sister called from out-of-state to give us this scripture: <span class="scripture">&#8220;The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+34%3A7" title="Psalm 34:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 34:7)</span></a></span> I thought about how the baby&#8217;s presence had brought us closer to God. The Lord had used this little human vessel to help those around her get closer to God. It was then my prayer that she would be able to continue the job God had for her, as she moved on to this new home. The Lord gave opportunity for this to be shared with the new mother as tears flowed in the giver as well as the receiver.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Foundation_Truth_12/babies_c.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="128" /></div>
<p>Oh, all who know the power of prayer, may you also lift your heart to heaven for the little vessel God is using to touch lives! Just think of all the little vessels God is using to touch lives everywhere! What a different place this world would be if there were no babies. Each little life is such a miracle. They are God&#8217;s gifts, just lent to us for a time. Parents, don&#8217;t take your children for granted. They are very special&#8212;study them, get all the good God has for you in sending them to you. He has things to teach you through them.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Foundation_Truth_12/babies_d.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="112" /></div>
<p>It is an amazing picture. God continually sends innocent little ones among the human race. It is true that they each become tainted with the nature of sin upon conception, but they are innocent before God in that they have committed no wrong, and they remain innocent for a number of years. How this innocence works on the hearts of mankind! What mercy, that God continually blesses the human race in this way! Some are wanted and desired; many are not. The precious gift of innocence is despised and disregarded with many, but still it exerts its effect. Even when the recipients abuse and neglect the precious little one, the lesson will not go away. The increased brutality on the part of the unappreciative continues to preach and warn, though the little innocent ones suffer in their mission.</p>

<p>Then they come to an age where they are accountable for their doings, and they sin, too. The little innocent ones are no longer innocent, but sinners before a just and loving God. And then, in their turn, as they continue on, God sends them yet more little innocent ones&#8230;. Thus the entire human race goes through an enormously significant change. All were clear before God at one time. Then <span class="scripture">&#8220;all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+3%3A23" title="Romans 3:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 3:23)</span></a></span> Then a few are saved. O reader! Will you be one of those who come back to God? Will you find what it means to be innocent before Him again? <span class="scripture">&#8220;Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+18%3A3" title="Matthew 18:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 18:3)</span></a></span></p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Foundation_Truth_12/babies_e.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="126" /></div>
<p>Adolf Hitler was once innocent before God. King Ahab and Queen Jezebel were once innocent little ones. Genghis Khan, at one time, had done no sin. God, in His mercy, continually injects living proof that there is innocence before God in human beings. It is possible to regain that innocence after losing it to sin. Oh, that all men would <span class="scripture">&#8220;become as little children&#8221;</span>!</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Foundation_Truth_12/babies_f.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="123" /></div>
<p>The sacrifice was made. The baby was committed to God&#8217;s keeping and both cars went opposite directions. We have been comforted that God is watching over her. It has been only a week ago, but it seems like its been a month. There just seems to be a curtain between us and the grief we experienced. Surely we serve the God of all comfort.</p>

<p>The Lord gave my husband this scripture: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that in heaven <b>their angels</b> do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+18%3A10" title="Matthew 18:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 18:10)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+35%3A10" title="Isaiah 35:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 35:10)</span></a></span></p>

<h1>Learning to Pray</h1>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Foundation_Truth_12/learning_pray.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="272" /></div>
<p class="verse">Kneeling fair in the twilight gray,
<br />A beautiful child was trying to pray;
<br />His cheek on his mother&#8217;s knee,
<br />His little bare feet half hidden,
<br />His smile still coming unbidden,
<br />And his heart brim full of glee.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;I want to laugh. Is it naughty? say;
<br />Oh, Mama! I&#8217;ve had such fun today,
<br />I can hardly say my prayers;
<br />I don&#8217;t feel just like praying,
<br />I want to be outdoors, playing,
<br />And run all undressed downstairs.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;I can see the flowers in the garden bed
<br />Shining so pretty, and sweet and red,
<br />And Sammy is swinging, I guess!
<br />Ah, everything is so fine out there,
<br />I want to put it all in my prayer.
<br />(Do you mean I can do it by &#8216;Yes&#8217;?)</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;When I say, &#8216;Now I lay me,&#8217; word for word,
<br />It seems to me as if nobody heard.
<br />Would &#8216;Thank You, dear God,&#8217; be right?
<br />He gave me my mama,
<br />And papa and Sammy&#8212;
<br />Oh, Mama! You nodded I might.&#8217;</p>

<p class="verse">Clasping his hands, and hiding his face,
<br />Unconsciously yearning for help and grace,
<br />The little one now began;
<br />His mother&#8217;s nod and sanction sweet,
<br />Had led him close to the dear Lord&#8217;s feet,
<br />And his words like music ran:</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Thank You for making this house so nice,
<br />The flowers, and folks, and my two white mice,
<br />(I wish I could keep right on,)
<br />I thank You, too, for every day,
<br />Only I&#8217;m most too glad to pray;
<br />Dear God, I think I am done.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Now, Mama, rock me just a minute,
<br />And sing the hymn with &#8216;darling&#8217; in it.
<br />I wish I could say my prayers!
<br />When I get big I know I can,
<br />Oh! won&#8217;t it be nice to be a man,
<br />And stay all night downstairs.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">The mother singing, clasped him tight,
<br />Kissed and cooing her fond, &#8220;Good night,&#8221;
<br />And treasured his every word,
<br />For well she knew that the artless joy,
<br />And love of her precious, innocent boy,
<br />Were prayers that her Lord had heard.</p>

<p class="noindent first">Dear Princesses,</p>

<p>The following article is written from the perspective of a young sister, and therefore will communicate the vision more understandably to your hearts than I could. My prayer is that both she and you will let the lesson sink deeply into your souls. The devil fights hard against the &#8220;keeper at home&#8221; because his success at destroying our society is most threatened by the soldier of Jesus who stands in this gap and defends it.</p>

<h1>Homemakers</h1>

<p>A young woman once told me, &#8220;Homemaking is such a brainless task! Dishes, laundry, food preparation, diapers&#8230;&#8203;I would get so <i>bored</i>.&#8221; As she talked, memories began to flood my mind, and a very different picture of homemaking forms&#8230;.</p>

<p>My view of a homemaker starts with my mother. Mothers make and hold the family together, you know. My dad, with his endless ideas and plans, may have given me the spark of life and adventure that runs in my blood, but my mother gave me a picture of what a fulfilling job homemaking can be. My very earliest memories are of my parents together. I remember Mama making breakfast and Daddy singing songs about Mama being the &#8220;sweetest one&#8221; in the world. Mama would plot and plan to make special things for Daddy, things he would especially like. Once, when Daddy came back from a business trip to Alaska, he brought back a lemon muffin that he particularly enjoyed. Mama said, &#8220;Abigail, try this muffin with me and see if you can tell what flavorings are hidden in it.&#8221; Mama taught me how to taste something and figure out what ingredients were inside, so we could make the item ourselves. Mama must have saved Daddy thousands of dollars by taking his favorite store-bought items and learning how to make them&#8212;usually with better taste&#8212;from scratch. When she would succeed, Daddy would crow over her accomplishments like she was a queen.</p>

<p>Mama was always busy and nearly always humming or singing a song. Besides cooking up all those delicacies for Daddy, she homeschooled my sister and me. Mama read us stories, and listened to us read. She had us cut pictures out of magazines for noun and verb books. Her kitchen table was always covered with some project. Mama would see a two-dollar dollhouse at a garage sale as a fantastic project and spend hours with her girls painting it to fix it up. She taught us how to make curtains and bedspreads and provided us with books that showed us how to turn sponges into couches. She oohed and aahhed over the creative things we did and kept a careful eye on everything we learned. Once, working on my dollhouse, I strung &#8220;Christmas lights&#8221; (it was actually ribbon with little fabric balls) all over my house. Mama was a little quiet when I showed her my latest invention and then she said, &#8220;Abigail, don&#8217;t you think that looks a little fancy? Would we put that on our real house?&#8221; That&#8217;s all she said, but I took down those &#8220;Christmas lights&#8221; and never put them up again. Mama knew the danger of doing things in play that we considered wrong to do in &#8220;real life.&#8221;</p>

<div class="center"><img src="../../Foundation_Truth_12/homemakers_canning.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="299" /></div>
<p>In the summertime, Mama gave us bonnets and buckets and away we went to pick berries. Strawberries came first, then raspberries, cherries, blueberries and peaches, and last, marionberries and blackberries. Some women may consider berry picking brainless, but because of my mother, berry picking is a season I still look forward to each summer. Mama taught us that it took careful planning in the summer to have your pantry and freezer filled all winter. One year my sister and I waxed very enthusiastic about picking peaches, picking nearly 400 lbs. That was two or three times more than the amount our family of four needed for a winter. Mama smiled at our enthusiasm and paid for the peaches. It took the three of us four days straight (with hardly any sleep) to can/freeze/dry the peaches before they rotted in the hot August weather. I think we had enough peaches for at least two years after, but for some reason we picked peaches again the next year.</p>

<p>I do not remember ever going to a baby-sitter while Mama went shopping or had free time. When we were little, she took us with her to do grocery shopping and all her errands. I know we must have tried her patience and the trips would certainly have been less work without us, but mothering was her job, and she never considered leaving us behind. I remember trying to read the labels off the cans, and as we grew older, sometimes she&#8217;d have us figure up the total that was in the cart. Although the library was not a place Mama grew up visiting, Daddy thought it was important for us, so our grocery trips often included a trip to the library. Mama taught herself how to use the library and found books on cooking, gardening, sewing, and soap-making that enhanced her homemaking job. Mama was always trying to be a better homemaker. She taught my sister and I that there is so much to learn about homemaking that she had just started to scratch the surface.</p>

<p>I grew up thinking that homemaking was the most wonderful job in the world for a woman. In a homemaker&#8217;s day, you might be a secretary taking down business calls for your self-employed husband. You could be a scientist learning what makes the best meringues on a lemon pie that does not &#8220;weep&#8221; liquid, or a seamstress making tailor-made clothes that look professional. Mother always had a quest for wanting to sew faster. She would talk to professional seamstresses for hints and ideas. You can become a biologist gardener that studies the soil and learns the best nutrients for growing certain plants and vegetables. You can be a professional house cleaner, developing the best system ever invented. You can have that great joy of little arms around your neck, telling you that you are the best mother in the world. Isn&#8217;t that worth more than any self-esteem-boosting job anywhere?</p>

<p>Homemaking&#8212;a waste of brains? A boring job that buries you at home? That depends on your vision. Is it really that fulfilling to be a secretary at a law office? Is it so very exciting to be a vet that works on sick animals day after day? To bring home a paycheck of considerable size, is that what life is about?</p>

<p>When I was a young teenager, I remember that the example of my mother made me think that making a home for my husband and children was all I ever wanted to be. I loved to cook, tried my best to sew (something that was frustrating for me!), and even enjoyed things like washing windows and learning the laundry. Somewhere along the line though, homemaking became less glamorous. Perhaps it was because I didn&#8217;t have a husband, and it seemed like one would never appear. Why learn to keep house for one&#8217;s self? Youth is so impatient. I began to think about school&#8212;higher schooling. I began to see shortcomings in my parent&#8217;s way of home schooling and decided that perhaps private school was a better method of becoming educated. I began tutoring and working my way to become a teacher. There was nothing wrong in this, but perhaps my focus was off in the fact that I contended that being involved in ministerial work was more fulfilling than being a wife and mother. I felt that I did not want to be tied down to &#8220;just my family&#8221; someday. I wanted to tell the gospel&#8212;and there was nothing wrong with this, except that I couldn&#8217;t imagine how I was going to minister to others while being a wife and mother, and tried to combine in theory the roles of a single woman and a married woman. I really was pretty rock-hard about still being in ministry after I was married and had children. I said I would only marry a man who was into the same ministry as well and we&#8217;d do it together. (Guess I skipped all those passages in the Bible about being <i>his</i> help meet?) God knew that I was sincere in what I believed, and He also knew how to change me.</p>

<p>Early one spring, I became the mother to a newborn baby girl. I was appointed guardian with the intention of adoption, bringing her straight home from the hospital. I was still teaching school. I spent a week with my new daughter after she was born, but because it was still the middle spring term of school, I had to go back. My daughter was seven days old the morning I took her to my parents&#8217; house to be cared for by my sister while I was at school. I&#8217;ll never forget that morning. I laid my sleeping newborn daughter into my sister&#8217;s arms and kissed her goodbye. Near panic welled up into my heart as I thought of the eight hours I would be gone from her. I cried all the way to school that morning and every day after that for at least a week. I prayed that God would help me do the &#8220;job of my dreams&#8221; because it was still my job.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got a stubborn personality, but God completely changed my heart and helped me to realize that the job of being a keeper at home, is the only happy one for a woman, because <i>in God&#8217;s word that is the work He has outlined for us</i>. It is the enemy that tells us we are wasting our brains. The devil knows what a wonderful plan God has designed in having the women be keepers at home. It is the most fulfilling, self-esteem-boosting, interesting, and creative job out there for a woman. The enemy wants to rob mothers of their joy, telling them they are wasting their lives on the husband and children. A woman&#8217;s ministry is loving her husband and training her children about the real virtues in life. A woman&#8217;s ministry is being a living example of a stay-at-home wife and mother to all her neighbors and those she comes in contact with. My mother had countless women visit her. Most of them envied my mom. She was happy and they envied her marriage, because most of the time, theirs were falling apart. I remember mom teaching other women how to can fruit, and we weren&#8217;t always alone when we went to pick berries. Some women wanted to learn how to sew, and Mama was always happy to share her expertise. Most of the time, though, they just wanted to talk, and take Mama&#8217;s time. She always took time to listen to other women (although the phone did go off the hook during school time). Mama would do daycare and counsel the mothers to quit their jobs to take care of their children themselves. Very rarely would this happen, but she always told them if they cared to listen. Now that my sister and I are grown and away from home, Mama&#8217;s time is even more taken up with counseling women. Sometimes mothers of my dad&#8217;s tutoring or piano students come to talk to Mama. Recently, a broken woman, deep in sin, called my mom and asked her why life was so hard. Mama has a ministry, right there in her home. Her ministry springs out of being a stay-at-home wife and mother.</p>

<p>If you are standing on the brink of life, with all the decisions that come with being a youth, choose God&#8217;s way. The beauty of a career is painted in bold colors by the world, but you will find that when you choose that way, the beautiful colors disappear, and reality is not what it was painted to be. You can never find happiness in the job of your dreams.</p>

<p>Dear mother, are you discouraged with the challenges of being a stay-at-home mom? Does leaving your child with a baby-sitter seem a small price for a few hours of quietness? Embrace your calling. If your mother did not stay at home with you, think of all the memories you want to make with your children that you missed. Seek to please your husband. Treat him like a king. Fix the foods that he likes. Dress the way he wants you to dress (if it is modest and pleasing to God). Arrange the house the way he likes it and finds it comfortable. Don&#8217;t think about yourself and how to make <i>you</i> happy, focus on your husband and your children. Mama says that making your husband happy will make you happy. Establish a story time with the children and talk to them throughout the day. I knew I could always talk to my mother, anytime, and she would listen. You don&#8217;t have to be a super woman. Enjoy quiet moments with the children&#8212;braiding your daughter&#8217;s hair, telling a Bible story, admiring your son&#8217;s dirt city, and tasting a bit of that mud pie. There is no greater job than training the hearts and minds of little eternal beings. Stop wishing you were a missionary. Did the mother of Betty Stam spend her days wishing she could be someone great, or did she train her daughter to love God? God wants to use you, right there in your home, caring for your fussy baby. Someday your baby girl is going to be a woman. What image of womanhood will you have portrayed to her?</p>

<p>For those of you young women who are out there saying, &#8220;But I don&#8217;t have a husband. I don&#8217;t have a family. Why should I learn to be a keeper at home? Why can&#8217;t I pursue a career while I&#8217;m waiting?&#8221;</p>

<p>I want you to listen to this scripture. <span class="scripture">&#8220;I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+5%3A14" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 5:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 5:14)</span></a></span> God has said in His word that it is His will for us, as young ladies, to marry, bear children and guide our homes. For those of us who are not married, perhaps it would be well for us to seek God to prepare us for our calling. God will not give us husbands if our hearts are not at home. I am aware that God does not call every person to marriage, but certainly He intends the majority to be married. Seek God&#8217;s way and follow His path. It is certainly not wrong to be a teacher, florist, baker, cake decorator, house cleaner, work in a greenhouse or sewing shop, but it is the attitude of the heart that is important. Are we learning these skills to better prepare ourselves for our future homes? Or are we selfishly pursuing a career and seeking fulfillment in a paycheck? We are only given so much preparation time. It is difficult to learn to shop with a baby and a couple of toddlers hanging on your skirts. Yes, you can take a cooking class at 55 years old, but how much are you going to have to give to others if you have to spend your later life learning the skills you should already know?</p>

<p>So many young people I meet in life just seem to sort of &#8220;fall in&#8221; to being wives and husbands and parents. They waste their youth, but then life &#8220;happens&#8221; to them and they find themselves married. This is not God&#8217;s way. He has a plan for your life, a future designed, and a path to get you to the place He wants you to be. But God only does the planning. It is us up to us to do the choosing.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p class="verse">God has a plan for every man and nation;
<br />God has a plan for every lost creation;
<br />Often that plan I cannot always see,
<br />But, if I trust Him, He&#8217;ll make it clear to me.</p>

<p class="verse">I want my life to magnify the precious Son of God,
<br />I want my life to glorify the path that I have trod,
<br />I want to walk so all the world can see
<br />Christ only, always, living each day in me.</p>

<h1>A Letter About Courage</h1>

<p>The Lord showed me some things the other day that I wanted to share with you.</p>

<p>It was on courage. I was first reading in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Numbers+13%3A23-33">Numbers 13:23-33</a> about the spies&#8217; report of the land of Canaan. What made the difference between the two reports? They all ate of the fruit of Canaan. They confessed that the Lord&#8217;s promise was true: <span class="scripture">&#8220;surely it floweth with milk and honey.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Numbers+13%3A27" title="Numbers 13:27"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Numbers 13:27)</span></a></span></p>

<p>I looked at the report. It was true that the people were stronger than they; it was true that there were walled cities; giant people did dwell there, and there were many nations to conquer. It is later stated (speaking of those nations) that they were <span class="scripture">&#8220;greater and mightier.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+4%3A37-38" title="Deuteronomy 4:37-38"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Deuteronomy 4:37-38)</span></a></span> It wasn&#8217;t something to be ignored, but what did Caleb say? <span class="scripture">&#8220;Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Numbers+13%3A30" title="Numbers 13:30"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Numbers 13:30)</span></a></span></p>

<p>How did he have such confidence? Had the Lord prepared them for this trial? Yes, He had promised the land to them. Right before the spies were sent out (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Numbers+13%3A1">Numbers 13:1</a>) the Lord had again confirmed the promise, saying, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan which I give unto the children of Israel.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Numbers+13%3A2" title="Numbers 13:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Numbers 13:2)</span></a></span> And Moses, when he was telling them how to spy out the land, added, <span class="scripture">&#8220;and be ye of good courage.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Numbers+13%3A20" title="Numbers 13:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Numbers 13:20)</span></a></span></p>

<p>In the first chapter of Joshua we see how necessary it was for them to have courage to conquer the land. The Lord says to them not once, not twice, but three times to <span class="scripture">&#8220;be strong and of a good courage.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Joshua+1%3A6%2C9%2C18" title="Joshua 1:6,9,18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Joshua 1:6,9,18)</span></a></span> The Lord knew how vital it was. It is vital for us to <span class="scripture">&#8220;be strong and of a good courage&#8221;</span> to be able to conquer over our enemy and claim God&#8217;s promised land.</p>

<p>I thought of the first part of the command: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Be strong.&#8221;</span> God brought the verse to my mind in Ephesians where it says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+6%3A10" title="Ephesians 6:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 6:10)</span></a></span> Be strong by leaning on Him.</p>

<p>Next I looked at the second part: <span class="scripture">&#8220;and of a good courage.&#8221;</span> Different times when I have read through this first chapter of Joshua, I have had a sinking feeling in my heart. God&#8217;s command to <span class="scripture">&#8220;be strong and of a good courage&#8221;</span> seemed so huge. I tried to obey it, but always felt lacking.</p>

<p>As I looked at the passage again, the Lord spoke to me. &#8220;I don&#8217;t command something unless I also give you the power to do it.&#8221; I certainly didn&#8217;t feel courageous with the almost certain fact staring me in the face that I wouldn&#8217;t get through this allergy season without another attack of asthma. I stopped, considering what I was saying inside: &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel courageous.&#8221; Did God command us to <i>feel</i> courageous? No. So I thought, well then, what is <i>being</i> courageous? I looked up the word <i>courage</i>. I didn&#8217;t know what some of the words defining it meant so I looked them up also. Here is a summary of what I found:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first"><b>courage</b>: that quality of mind which enables men to encounter danger and difficulties with firmness, or without fear or depression of spirits.</p>

<p><b>intrepidity</b>: fearlessness; fearless bravery in danger; undaunted courage or boldness.</p>


<p><b>undaunted</b>: not subdued or depressed by fear</p>

<p><b>valor</b>: strength of mind in regard to danger</p>

<p><b>resolution</b>: the effect of fixed purpose; firmness, steadiness or constancy in execution, implying courage</p>

</blockquote>


<p>It was so encouraging to me. The Lord had given the command to me in a bite size. All I had to do to have courage was to set my will and take a stand against the fears the devil wanted to paint in my mind&#8212;to fixedly choose to believe in God&#8217;s promises.</p>

<p>The Lord is so good to us. He gives us one step at a time. Like the song says, &#8220;One step at a time, you see,/Is enough for you, is enough for me.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Step_by_Step/index.html" title="Step by Step">*</a> If we desire with all our hearts to follow Him, He will enable us, like Much-Afraid in the allegory <i>Hinds&#8217; Feet on High Places</i>, to climb even the great precipice of Injury.</p>

<p>The enemy is greater and mightier than us. But wait a minute&#8212;God is able, with His little finger, to cast him down. Praise God!</p>

<p>I would appreciate your prayers in this that when the going gets tough I would set my will to have courage and trust in God. As the Lord brings you to mind, I pray for you.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+3%3A20-21" title="Ephesians 3:20-21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 3:20-21)</span></a></span></p>

<h1>A Young Sister&#8217;s Letter to an Older One and Her Reply</h1>

<p class="noindent">May, 1978
<br />Dear Sis. F&#8212;&#8212;,</p>

<p>Greetings to you this evening in Jesus&#8217; name. I am so thankful for His great love and mercy to me.</p>

<p>You are probably surprised to be hearing from me. It has come to my mind several different times to write you, asking for prayer and advice. I have complete confidence in your life and appreciate your sincerity so much. I also feel I can tell you what is on my heart and it will be kept confidential.</p>

<p>I am enjoying my work here. I find it satisfying and rewarding to be doing something for the Lord. Yet at other times I have a very strong desire to have a companion and a home of my own. I don&#8217;t want to shirk my duty here. I want to stay here just as long as the Lord wants me to stay, and to be content where He has placed me. I have even asked the Lord to take the desire for a companion away if He didn&#8217;t want me to have one, because I know if it wasn&#8217;t given from the Lord, I wouldn&#8217;t be happy. I want His will to be done above all. But the desire for a companion and home just about overwhelms me sometimes. I just felt like I needed someone to help me pray. I know the Lord will not fail; His promises are sure. He said He would give us the desires of our heart if we delight in Him. I have asked the Lord to give me desires that would only please and glorify Him, because I don&#8217;t want anything that He doesn&#8217;t want me to have. <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+37%3A4-7">Psalm 37:4-7</a> has been a comfort to me many times. Committing our way unto the Lord, trusting in Him, and He shall bring it to pass. Also resting in the Lord and waiting patiently. The Lord has pointed out many scriptures to me about waiting on the Lord in the past years. But of late, He has been bringing the thought of having faith. Even though there are so few single boys my age among the saints, I just feel there must be somebody somewhere for me.</p>

<p>I learned a new song, which has been an encouragement to me. It says:</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Keep on praying, prayer of faith avail,
<br />Keep on praying, God can never fail,
<br />Keep on praying, plead His promise true,
<br />Keep on praying, God will answer you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before starting this letter, I knelt in prayer asking the Lord to help me write what He wanted and to help me put on paper just what was on my heart, so you would understand my need. I do want the Lord&#8217;s will to be done in my life and I want to be happy, content and satisfied with Hisdealings. Pray for me.</p>

<p class="signature">&#8212;A single young sister of 28</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p class="noindent">Dear Sister,</p>

<p>Greetings to you in the precious name of Jesus. Yes, truly His love and mercy are great towards us. I am glad that I ever found Him precious to my soul, and I want to live for Him all the days of my life.</p>

<p>I am glad that you shared your burden with me. It helps oft times when we can confide the burden of our heart with someone. You explained how you felt about your work&#8230;&#8203;and that you wanted to stay there just as long as the Lord wants you there and desire to be contented where He has placed you&#8212;also that you want His will to be done in your life above all. Dear sister, strive to keep that consecration. I believe that is what the Lord desires you to do. Your desire for a companion is a natural desire, and it is our privilege to take this desire to the dear Lord. As you continue holding it before the Lord, continue to keep your consecration, &#8220;Lord, Thy will be done above all else.&#8221; You may have to battle sometimes to keep it that way but this is a part of our Christian warfare. Like you said, if the Lord doesn&#8217;t give you a companion, you wouldn&#8217;t be happy with one.</p>

<p>God has answered prayer for different ones who looked to God for a companion and waited on Him. Sister H&#8212;&#8212; took this matter to the Lord and God saved a young man for her. Others have looked to God, and God answered their prayers. After you came and talked to us while Sis. P&#8212;&#8212; was still living, we continued to hold this matter before the Lord. (You no doubt remember the time I am referring to.) She and I would have prayer together after my husband would go to work of a morning. I will continue to be in agreement with you in this matter.</p>

<p>Sister, there is a precious scripture in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+54%3A5">Isaiah 54:5</a>, <span class="scripture">&#8220;For thy Maker is thine husband; the Lord of hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel, the God of the whole earth shall he be called.&#8221;</span> Then in the New Testament, the thought is brought out of the church being the bride of Christ. I like this thought of being the bride or wife of Christ. He is our spiritual husband and companion. He loves us with an everlasting love. He even gave His life for us. He is with us continually and will never leave us nor forsake us. Others may not always understand us, but He always does. We can share every burden, tell Him every secret of our heart, knowing He knows and understands and cares. We must be fully obedient to Him as a true wife must, but He will never require unreasonable or unseasonable service. He will never send us to do a task alone but will go with us, and help us. He can fill the place in our life that even an earthly companion cannot. An earthly companion can do much for us, but they cannot fill the need of our soul as our heavenly companion can. This relationship with the Lord is one we can enjoywhether single or married. I have two husbands&#8212;the Lord and A&#8212;&#8212;.</p>

<p>Dear Sister, you have a freedom now that you want to appreciate and use wholly to the glory of God. I believe that you are striving to do this, but I feel like speaking now of it. I mean the freedom of a single life. I was once a single girl serving the Lord, striving to serve the Lord and wanting to fill the place of service to the Lord just as you are. I didn&#8217;t have a companion until I was nearly 26. When I entered into the marriage covenant with A&#8212;&#8212;, fully believing it to be God&#8217;s plan for my life, I found that it brought many responsibilities, and that I didn&#8217;t have the freedom that I had in my single life. I speak of this with the desire that you may fully realize and appreciate the freedom which you now have while you have it. You may already appreciate it, but I felt like speaking of it. Sometimes, we don&#8217;t fully realize or appreciate a blessing which we have until it is gone or in the past.</p>

<p>May the dear Lord truly bless you and work out that plan in your life that will be to His greatest glory and for your best good. May you be like Mary of old. After the angel revealed a part of God&#8217;s plan for her life, she said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;q=Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to thy word " title=""><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> ()</span></a></span></p>

<p>I will continue to pray.</p>

<p class="signature">Christian love,
<br />Sis. F&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>The Lord indeed did answer prayer. It was a year later that the Lord put it in the heart of a young man to court and marry this young sister. Young sisters, it truly pays&#8212;let me repeat it again, it really, truly pays to wait on God.</p>

<blockquote><p class=" center first">from <i>Letters of Love and Counsel</i>, by Jenny C. Rutty</p>
</blockquote>


<h1>Pride and Rebellion</h1>

<p>The root of all rebellion is pride. So no one who rejects any of the requirements of the Lord can be free from pride; for we read, <span class="scripture">&#8220;If any man&#8230;&#8203;consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness, he is proud, knowing nothing.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+6%3A3-5" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 6:3-5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 6:3-5)</span></a></span> <b>Many religious people will be quite submissive to many of the teachings of the Bible, but if certain truths are held before them, pride of heart asserts itself in opposition and contention or in apparent excuse for difference of opinion or belief.</b> If all pride is removed from the heart, there is nothing to hinder the Spirit from revealing the precious truth of God to our hearts and minds, thus bringing us to the knowledge of His will.</p>

<p>Will each one who reads this letter look into her heart, by the grace of God, and see if all this bitter root is removed by His grace? If it is not removed, please do not rest until by consecration, and faith in the precious cleansing stream of Christ&#8217;s atoning blood, it is removed, and you can praise His name from whom all blessings flow.</p>

<p>Humility is one of the most precious fruits of the Spirit of Christ in our hearts; for instead of desiring the approval and admiration of others, it seeks only to do and be what is good, true, and noble, because it is right and honors God.</p>

<p>When I have seen girls trying to show off, desiring to win attention from others, or to &#8220;hold their own with anybody,&#8221; endeavoring to &#8220;be boss of the situation,&#8221; as they express it, there has been a deep longing in my heart that they might see the sweet beauty of true humility. Very many love to be thought bold and careless, quenching all the sweet, gentle, and loving ways that make them truly lovable. Unassuming gentleness, thoughtfulness, firmness, and humble boldness for the right, are much more becoming, even among worldly people. But when we name the name of Christ and profess to be His followers, and do not seek meekness and Christlike humility, we dishonor His blessed name; for He entreats us to &#8220;be clothed with humility, for he resisteth the proud but giveth grace to the humble.&#8221; If we humble ourselves, He will exalt us by giving us the blessings of salvation.</p>

<p>True humility reveals our own nothingness, but receives the promises of God as a full supply for our lack, that in Him we can do all things that He requires, for &#8220;he strengtheneth us.&#8221; There is a false modesty or humility that springs from pride. For instance, a young lady is asked to sing for the entertainment of friends; she refuses, excuses herself, and becomes embarrassed and diffident, because some one there can sing better than she can. <b>The woods would be very silent if no birds sang there but those who sing best. The truly humble will do the best they can, not expecting commendation.</b></p>

<p>Then, dear girls, will you be subject to pride&#8217;s tyrannical control, or have it removed root and branch from your hearts, that you may obtain the pure humility of Christ and enjoy His blessings for time and eternity?</p>

<p class="verse">Come yield to God, give up your pride
<br />That grieves our Lord, and tries to hide
<br />In depths of fruit, that outward seem
<br />Quite fair and pure, but as the gleam
<br />Of truth divine shall pierce it through,
<br />Behold, it&#8217;s wormy, bitter, too,
<br />It has no value, cannot bring
<br />True peace or joy or anything,
<br />But sorrow deep or endless woe&#8212;
<br />&#8217;Tis true, we reap just what we sow.</p>

<h1>Just Mary: Part 4</h1>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">As we continue our story, the troubles that come into Mary&#8217;s life from living with a hostile stepmother intensify to a crisis point&#8212;will Uncle Roy&#8217;s desire to help his niece ever materialize into reality before it is too late?</p>
</div>


<hr class="minor" />
<p>Roy Harmon&#8217;s letters, his pictures, and the curios that he sent to Mary did not make things better for her in her stepmother&#8217;s home. By the age of fourteen, life was almost unbearable to her. Practically all the work of the home was left to her, and, try as she might, there was never anything done just right. Her stepmother never failed to humiliate her all she could if anyone chanced to be there.</p>

<p>There were two more children in the home now&#8212;Henry, aged two, and a small baby girl, Rosa, just three months of age. There was a lean-to storage room behind the house, which could only be entered by going outside. Mary had to take this room, and her bed was reduced to a straw bed on the floor. It was not an uncommon thing for her to awaken to find rain coming through the cracks, or the snow sifting through on her face. She knew she was not there because it was really necessary, for there was the front room, which was always used as a spare room for company, and the bed was always dressed in snowy whiteness. But her stepmother would never hear to her occupying that bed at all. If Mary would ever mention the rain or the snow coming in through the cracks in her room, her stepmother would say, &#8220;Well, that is better than you deserve.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary could not go to her father with anything, for he had become cross and sullen, never giving a kind word to any of the children nor to his wife, and seldom spoke when about the place. But through it all, Mary could not think that her father was altogether bad when she recalled pleasant memories of the past.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Winter had passed. A program and old-fashioned spelling bee was announced to close the school term. Caroline and Nancy had been attending school and were given a part in the program. As an invitation was given to all the parents to attend, Myra made preparation to go with the children&#8212;planning on Mary&#8217;s remaining at home to care for the younger ones. Mary longed to attend that spelling bee, but she knew if she should mention the fact to her stepmother, there would be no chance for her to get there at all. So the days went by and the evening came for the program and the spelling bee.</p>

<p>They were all seated around the table when Myra said, &#8220;Dan, I want you to get cleaned up a little and go with me tonight to the schoolhouse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon being informed as to what was taking place, he said, &#8220;Can&#8217;t Mary go with you and help you with the children? I&#8217;m not going, but I shall keep Elmer and Ellen. I think that you and Mary can manage the rest of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Myra flew into a rage, as she very often did, but Dan had become very obstinate. &#8220;Very well then, if Mary doesn&#8217;t go none of the others need go either.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Mary went to the spelling bee that night, with Otis holding onto one arm and carrying baby Rose in the other arm. She was dressed in a garment made from one of her stepmother&#8217;s old dresses, and her shoes were laced with a calico string, but her heart sang because she was attending the spelling bee.</p>

<p>The schoolhouse was packed. You could see eager expectancy written on all their faces as proud parents came to hear their children do their part in the program. Caroline and Nancy each gave a recitation. Mary&#8217;s heart beat a rat-a-tat in her bosom as they each spoke their pieces that she had taken so much pains to help them memorize, and as they did their part without any blunder, she felt that she had been rewarded for all her efforts. How cute they looked in their new dresses and hair ribbons; dresses that Mary had made for them! She felt proud of them.</p>

<p>After a short break came the old-fashioned spelling bee in which Miss Myers asked that all take part. Henry and Rose were both asleep, and when all were called to take part, Myra stood with the other students&#8217; mothers. When Mary saw her leave the baby, she too left Henry sleeping on the desk where she had been sitting and took her place in line.</p>

<p>Only one chance was given at a word, and if it was misspelled, it was passed on to the next one and the one who missed took his seat. After several times around, so many had taken their seats that Mary was now standing beside her stepmother and therefore spelling against her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Audacious,&#8221; pronounced Miss Myers.</p>

<p>It was now Myra&#8217;s turn to spell, and all could see that she was very uncertain about the word. Finally she spelled in a questioning way, &#8220;a-u-d-a-s-h-u-s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Myers smilingly said, &#8220;Next.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not any question with Mary as to how it was spelled, for she could see it in her mind&#8217;s eye&#8212;on page eighty-three of the speller, on the left side of the book, in the third column of spelling&#8212;and so she spelled it unhesitatingly, &#8220;a-u-d-a-c-i-o-u-s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Correct.&#8221;</p>

<p>Myra took her place with the others who had missed their words, but her face was scarlet and her eyes flashed fire. She felt humiliated in being outspelled by her stepdaughter.</p>

<p>But Miss Myers kept pronouncing words and those around the wall kept spelling until there were only two left standing, and they were Mary and Frank Fletcher, who was a cousin of Myra&#8217;s. Five minutes passed, and the two were still standing.</p>

<p>Miss Myers had turned to the back of the old speller, to find some more difficult words, when off the desk rolled Henry, landing in the seat below and letting out a frightened scream.</p>

<p>Myra rose to her feet, and in a sharp tone of voice said, &#8220;Mary, I think you have stood there long enough; if you had been there with your little brother where you belong, he would not have rolled off the desk. Go on now and take care of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another mother had already lifted Henry in her arms and quieted him, so that he lay back in her arms and went to sleep again. She said, &#8220;Let her alone, and I shall see after him.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Mary kept her place beside Frank, spelling her words positively. Another leaf was turned; and Miss Myers then began to pronounce words taken from the French language and used in the English language. Several words were pronounced, each taking their turn in spelling, and then came the word rendezvous to Frank. He stood hesitatingly for some time before trying to spell. When Miss Myers pronounced it for him the second time he began in an uncertain manner, &#8220;r-e-n-d-a-v-o-u.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Next.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary caught the word and spelled positively, &#8220;r-e-n-d-e-z-v-o-u-s,&#8221; and pronounced it also.</p>

<p>&#8220;Correct.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the old schoolhouse rang with cheers. But anyone could see that Myra was angry. She took the family home just as soon as they could get away at the close, and poor Mary had to bear the sharpness of her tongue all the way home. Dan was delighted when the news was broken to him the next morning at the breakfast table. When told that Mary spelled the word that his wife had missed he burst into a loud, &#8220;Ha ha!&#8221; This, of course, started another scene in the Dennison home on which we shall draw the curtain.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Two days after the close of school, the news was circulated over the community that Fred Peffers had measles the evening of the spelling bee at the schoolhouse, so that he exposed all the children in the community. True enough, in a short time those children who had not had measles came down with them, and in many homes some of the older people. Caroline and Nancy came down with them first in the Dennison home; then Ellen and Otis. Ellen was quite ill of them, but the other children were only confined to their beds a few days. Poor Mary had much to do. Three weeks had passed and the two little ones in the Dennison home took measles; then Elmer and finally Mary. It was now the last week in April and a cool rain was falling, but Mary lay on her straw bed in the old lean-to off the kitchen. There had been another scene in the home. Dan was going about in one of his sullen moods; and Mary had been sick for two days before he inquired as to why she was not about the place. About this time Otis stole up to him and said, &#8220;Papa, Mary is awful sick; she won&#8217;t talk to me at all, and her bed covers are as wet as can be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, where is she?&#8221; inquired Dan. Otis led him to the little storeroom, and there he saw his eldest daughter on her straw bed, damp from the rain that had come through the cracks in the wall. He saw she was quite ill and that something must be done.</p>

<p>When he informed Myra of her condition, she said, &#8220;Well, she is your young one, not mine, and if you want anything done for her, do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dan immediately went to the spare room, and with the aid of Caroline soon had the bed ready for Mary, only to be opposed by Myra, who declared she should not be placed in the best room they had. This brought forth another scene in the Dennison home, but Dan came out the victor, for, taking Mary in his arms, he carried her to the front bedroom where he laid her on the best bed in the house.</p>

<p>Mary lay there for many days, hovering between life and death; pneumonia had set in, and Mary was a very sick girl. Aunt Millie came to Dan&#8217;s aid in caring for her, and the two of them nursed her back to health again.</p>

<p>It was there by the bedside of his eldest daughter that Dan Dennison came to himself and found what Mary really meant to him. Over and over he would chide himself for his neglect of her. Many times while she raved in delirium, he would sit by her bedside weeping and cry out, &#8220;Oh, Elsie, Elsie; I have been so neglectful of yours and mine. I have forfeited the right of being called a father, for I have not been one.&#8221; And one night as he and his sister watched by her bedside, expecting the little spark of life to flee at any time, he fell upon his knees and cried out, &#8220;O God, if You will but spare her, I promise you to be a better father than I have ever been and never neglect her again.&#8221; Her severe illness proved what she really meant to him. He knew that, had she not been neglected and left to sleep in the open, when ill of measles, the other affliction would not have come on her. But he was untiring in his attention to her and in his care of her. After several days of doubtful watching, Mary began to amend.</p>

<p>When she did recover, the front bedroom was now Mary&#8217;s room, and she no longer had to go to the old lean-to off the kitchen.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Another year passed, and there came a great hubbub in the Denison home, for Mary received a letter from Uncle Roy, sent from the Philippines, stating that he was soon sailing for the United States. His time had expired in the navy, and he did not mean to reenlist, so it would not be long until he would come to see his little Peachy girl. Soon another letter came from San Francisco stating he was in the States expecting to get his discharge in a few days, and he would then come to see them. But days passed, and then weeks, and the weeks stretched into months, for when entering the States he got a job which kept him busy so that he could not get away often. So Mary contented herself with his letters, although her disappointment was very great.</p>

<p>But Mary&#8217;s life was not so hard, for there were many bright spots in it. Dan was indeed a changed man and very kind and tender to Mary; his tenderness toward her now meant to be doubled, so that he might in some way atone for the neglect of bygone years. She no longer had to dress in cast-off clothing, for when the other children got new dresses, there was always one or more new ones for Mary. As she was neat about sewing, her clothes always looked nice, and she was developing into a beautiful young lady. After her illness, she lost all her hair, and now it hung in a mass of curls about her shoulders. Dan would often run his hands through her hair and say proudly, &#8220;My old curly-head.&#8221; Such attentions to Mary only angered her stepmother all the more, and she resented it with all the power there was in her, threatening many times to wait until she caught Mary asleep and cut the every last one of them off. But she did not get this opportunity, and, as she was so often cruel to the extreme with Mary and Otis, making them do things that were so unnecessary, Dan held a conference with Mary one day which brought desired results.</p>

<p>Myra had invited a number of her neighbors to her place for a quilting, and had left Mary to cook the dinner.</p>

<p>Mary was mixing some dough when Myra came to the kitchen. While opening the cabinet door to get a saucer to make some round markings on the quilt, she knocked the bowl containing the dough off, and it landed bottom side up on the floor. She flew into a rage and began to heap abuses on Mary for letting the bowl sit there. Mary went about cleaning up the mess that was made on the floor, and Myra returned to the room where the women were, telling what a time she had with Mary and how careless she was, stating that Mary had been so awkward and knocked a bowl of dough off on the floor.</p>

<p>Mary heard her through the open door, and all the resentment of her soul went out against her stepmother. Rising, she went into the room and confronted Myra, saying, &#8220;Now, Mother, you know that is not true at all, for you know that you upset that bowl yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Myra turned toward her and with her voice pitched high in anger said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll teach you to dispute my word like that,&#8221; and, raising her hand, tried to strike Mary on the face, but Mary was not there, as she had dodged the blow. Then she struck Myra with her open hand across the mouth. Those present stared open-mouthed as they saw these two return blow for blow. Mary was quicker than Myra, and so dodged many of her blows. Soon Myra sank into a chair and told Mary to behave herself. Mary was so angry she could not control herself, and there before those women told Myra of the past, of the threats made, of the many brutal beatings she had given her, and of putting her out in the lean-to to sleep and trying to make her stay there when she had measles. No one present interfered, and so Mary was left to have her say. She took advantage of the opportunity. She told her stepmother that her father had told her to do this very thing the next time she tried to punish her unjustly, and she did it and concluded by saying, as she pointed her finger in Myra&#8217;s face, &#8220;And I never expect to take another beating from you, for from now on the beatings will go the other way.&#8221; Myra sat dumb-founded, and then tried to silence her. After some time Mary became quiet, and then, returning to the kitchen, completed the dinner.</p>

<p>When Myra related the incident of the day to Dan, there was another scene in the Dennison home, as he informed her that he had instructed Mary to do the very thing she had done that day. Needless to say she was never compelled to take any more abuse from her stepmother, but a bitterness sprang up in Myra&#8217;s heart against Mary which ripened into hatred, and from that time on Mary made Myra&#8217;s life miserable. Many times Myra was tempted to drive her from home, but she was needed badly for the work which she did, and then she knew also that Dan would interfere, and she also knew that she now was being paid back and in good measure for some things she had done in the past. She was beginning to reap some things she had sown.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>One evening, in the last week in August, as the Dennison family sat down to their evening meal, a livery rig stopped at their front gate. A man and woman alighted, a couple of hand grips were set out of the rig, and the driver turned about in the road and headed his horses toward town. These two opened the gate and started up the walk. The Dennison&#8217;s did not recognize either of them until they were near the house, and then Mary ran through the room calling out, &#8220;It&#8217;s Uncle Roy; it&#8217;s Uncle Roy.&#8221; Soon Roy was again holding his little Peachy girl in his arms. He then presented the lady with him as her Aunt Ethel, and as Mary felt her warm handclasp and the loving caress on her cheek, her heart went out to her aunt; and Ethel in turn loved the curly-haired niece of her husband. Dan and Myra received them cordially, and all noticed the tears that fell from her eyes as Aunt Ethel felt the blind fingers of Otis pass over her face, as he tried to &#8220;see&#8221; his new aunty. A pleasant evening was spent together, and before the Dennison family retired for the evening, Ethel had found a warm place in each of their hearts.</p>

<p>It was not very long until Dan learned the reason for their visit. Roy had seen how Mary&#8217;s education had been neglected, and he asked that he might take her and Otis and educate them. At the end of the third day Dan consented, and then the children were consulted as to their desire. When Mary was informed, she fell on her Aunt Ethel&#8217;s neck and wept tears of joy, for the desire of her heart was now to be realized, and she could go to school at last. Otis, too, was delighted beyond words, for he was to be sent to a school for the blind in the same city where Uncle Roy lived. The next few days were spent in making preparation, with Myra moody and sullen. But she could say nothing, and did not, until the morning of their departure, when there was another scene in the Dennison home which made Uncle Roy more determined than ever to care for his sister&#8217;s children.</p>

<p>Dan went with them to the train, and, as he told his children goodbye, he broke down. Gathering them both in his arms, he sobbed like a child. He knew that he would not see them again for many days and possibly never, and although he had not done as some would think that he should have done, he loved the children of his young wife. It was hard to part with them although he knew it was all for the best for both him and them.</p>

<p>Otis and Mary enjoyed the trip greatly. When they arrived in the city where they were to live, they stared about them open-mouthed. Neither had ever seen a street car. They rode one home, and again Otis&#8217; fingers helped him to see what he was riding on.</p>

<p>Upon entering their new home, Mary stared in amazement, for there stood an upright piano, the first she had ever seen. When Aunt Ethel seated herself on the stool and began to run her fingers over the keys and bring out beautiful music, Mary looked on top of it, around the back of it, and then, getting on her hands and knees, tried to peep under it to see where the music was coming from. To others this would have been very amusing, but tears of sadness rolled over Uncle Roy&#8217;s cheeks as he thought of the neglected children who were so dear to him. He meant to do all that he could that others could see his Peachy girl as he saw her.</p>

<h1>Joy for Tribulation</h1>

<p class="author">L. E. and J. E.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Child, count it all joy,&#8221; He whispered the word,
<br />When hard the day and long,
<br />For no one took time to comfort and care,
<br />And all about felt wrong;
<br />&#8220;Just do it for Me, for Father alone&#8221;&#8212;
<br />For tears He gave a song.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Rejoice evermore,&#8221; the song sweetly sang,
<br />A gentle, pleading tone,
<br />When I had been called to give up my way,
<br />And seek another&#8217;s own;
<br />&#8220;The Savior&#8217;s own life was given for you;
<br />Will you repay the loan?&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Now count it all joy&#8221;&#8212;there murmured the breeze,
<br />When trials filled my way,
<br />When cares did surround and pulled from all sides,
<br />And troubles brought dismay;
<br />&#8220;God&#8217;s way is the best; His grace ever sure&#8221;&#8212;
<br />And peace dispersed the fray.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Rejoice in the Lord,&#8221; the Word of God said,
<br />When worries brought a frown;
<br />Anxiety&#8217;s cloud would give me no rest,
<br />My heart with care would drown;
<br />&#8220;Would Father above abandon His own?
<br />Why then are you so down?&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">Then joy, sweetest joy, was given to me,
<br />His Spirit came to stay&#8212;
<br />I yielded my will to Father&#8217;s control,
<br />To use as He should say;
<br />Surrendered and sealed, my heart He has filled 
<br />With joy for every day.</p>
