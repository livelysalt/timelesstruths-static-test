<h1>What is <i>Dear Princess</i>?</h1>

<p><i>Dear Princess</i> is a newsletter for young girls who seek and strive to please their Father, the King. It was started to encourage young girls in pursuing after the things of righteousness, growing in grace and becoming Godly young women. Most young ladies have the desire, Lord-willing, to become a wife and mother someday. To prepare for the future, we need to develop homemaking skills. Mothers and Grandmothers are very welcome to write in to encourage and teach us younger women.</p>

<p>This publication is free to anyone who request it. It is sent out prayerfully as the Lord lays upon my heart to do so. (About quarterly.) Stories, poems, articles, recipes, and letters are always welcome. If the Lord has blessed you with any special thought, send it in. Share your blessing with others that they may be blessed, too!</p>

<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
<p><i>Dear Princess</i> is published by Abigail Spinks with my family&#8217;s help. I assure you I couldn&#8217;t do it with out them! Also, thank you Laura, Alisha, Kara, Susan, and Skye and everyone else that made this issue possible by sending in submissions, working on proofreading and helping with editing, it was very much appreciated.</p>

<h1>Be Ye Kind One to Another</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>Greetings in the precious name of Jesus! The Lord has been speaking to us about being kind at home and we would like to share it with you. We pray it may be a blessing to you as you read it. (Note: Coquetta&#8217;s parts of this article are italicized.)</p>

<p>How often do we find ourselves being kind, polite, and gracious to our friends and neighbors only to feel tired and irritable when they leave toward our brothers and sisters and the rest of the family. Is it because it is so much effort to be kind to someone or is it that we feel like since it&#8217;s &#8220;just family,&#8221; we don&#8217;t need to guard our words and actions as we do when others are around. <i>Do we love our friends and neighbors more than our family? Most girls, I think, would say they loved their family more.</i> It is easier to be kinder to our friends because we don&#8217;t live with them all the time and know their weaknesses. But the Lord has grace for us to get along with the people we do live with. Namely, our father, mother, brother and sister. We may think, why does someone in my family always have to irritate me? But remember, that if we never had any trials we would never grow. The Lord will turn the trials into blessings, if we let Him. <i>Or else they will get just more and more irritating.</i> When something irritates us, or doesn&#8217;t please us exactly, we just need to ask the Lord what He wants us to get from this trial. We can be sure He will show us. <i>Sometimes, in mercy to us, because we don&#8217;t see ourselves, He will allow an embarrassing situation to happen to us and humble us down. Then He won&#8217;t leave us alone, and, if we don&#8217;t get in the &#8220;blaming shape of mind,&#8221; He will show us how to gain the victory, where before we failed of His grace.</i> I&#8217;ve learned that a lot of the time if I would just give in right away then it is not nearly so irritating as when I contended for my way and didn&#8217;t get it. What I mean is that when we humble down and aren&#8217;t selfish, (thinking about only your desires), it is easier not to be irritated because we are not focused on what we want. Also if it doesn&#8217;t concern you, there is no reason for you to be irritated.</p>

<p>The Lord has so many good things in mind for us if we will just let go and stop trying to do it our way! It would be a pretty sad thing if the Lord just left us alone! I&#8217;m thankful He has promised to never do that! He is so patient with us! The Bible instructs us to follow Him as our example; if we keep following Him, He will eventually lead us to the point where the things that bother and irritate us now, will be behind us. We want to get to the place where we can turn every thing over to Him&#8212;the fact that your sister always leaves her side of the room messy and your brother always leaves his jobs half done so you have to go back and do them for him. Ask the Lord for longsuffering, because, after all, someone is having forbearance with you.</p>

<p>We want to get all the Lord has for us in this; we surely don&#8217;t want to lack grace when the Lord freely gives it to us! The following situation is a familiar one between a grace-lacking sister and brother. Your brother comes in from the chicken yard. He forgets to wipe his boots on the mat or to take them off. He tracks mud in from the two-day rain across your beautiful, freshly-mopped floor. You forget that your friend did the same thing an hour ago, the only difference being she hadn&#8217;t been in the chicken yard. You start to yell at him to take off his boots and look what he has just done to the floor! He probably will answer something defensive and clump upstairs. After a few minutes reflection, to your shame you will realize that you have failed again.</p>

<p>There is something better for us than this. We may wonder why we usually have plenty of grace when friends are over and not with our brothers and sisters. First remember that &#8220;a soft answer turneth away wrath, but grievous words stir up anger.&#8221; If you had said in the situation above, &#8220;John, will you please take off your boots, I just cleaned the floor and would like to kept it that way for a while if I can,&#8221; John would probably feel ashamed of himself, take off his boots and clean the floor. Then you would have a blessing in your heart. And if John didn&#8217;t respond that way, still in your heart you would have a blessing because you did what was right!</p>

<p>If John had tracked in the mud while your friend was here, chances are you would not have yelled at him or gotten upset like did when only the family was present. You may say, &#8220;Oh, I would not want to embarrass my brother by correcting him in front of a friend. But really down inside you do not want your friend to know that you act that way toward your brother. You would like her to think that you are a kind, sweet, gentle girl under provocation&#8212;like the way you always act when she is with you. I don&#8217;t mean that it is right for us to go without grace when we are with our friends. <i>We need it then too.</i> Our usual manner when they are here, is to put on a front, <i>instead of making things right in our attitude toward the family.</i> If we really want help, ask the Lord to take that front away. He will help us start building the characteristics we need to have in our lives, such as gentleness, patience, purity, and trueness at home. It will not happen over night. <i>Every day there are trials and the victories for them, if we will act in such a way as to win them. We all have certain weaknesses. Every battle we fail to win, that certain weakness becomes weaker and the next time we have a trial in that area, it will be a little harder to win the victory. If we keep failing in that area, it will be harder and harder to get the victory that is there for it. Consequently, we will be very weak in that area. God has all the help we need to make all of our weak points strong. No matter how trying, irritating, annoying, aggravating, bothersome, or maddening the situation, God has <b>all</b> the grace we need to gain the victory!
<span class="scripture">&#8220;My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+12%3A9" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 12:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 12:9)</span></a></span>
Upon reflecting on some of the trials that I&#8217;ve failed in, I&#8217;ve often seen where if I&#8217;d had more of the grace of God, I would have gained the victory and been stronger; many times if I&#8217;d just spent more time with God, I would have had more of His mind in how to respond to the present trial. Sometimes we have easy days, when nothing seems to go wrong, but we really do not grow that much, whereas when we have trials we do. There are things inside of me that I don&#8217;t even know about, but God does. Just a few weeks ago I learned of some pride which had been in my heart since I was little that I never suspected was there. Trials purge (take away), the dross (things in us other than the things of God), and put things of true value in our hearts.</i></p>

<p>You are not alone as you try to please your Heavenly Father in this way. We are learning how to please Him and be true princesses in His Kingdom as many other dear sisters are.</p>

<p>We are glad to report this is not just a dream&#8212;it is a reality, for you too! You can make excuses and say, &#8220;Well, I was born with this temperament. I can&#8217;t help acting this way.&#8221; <i>But if you do, your heart won &#8217;t have the precious blessing that the Lord gives to those who gain the victory.</i></p>

<p>Praise the Lord, there <b>is</b> victory!</p>

<p>Love to all of you,
<br />From two princesses in the Kingdom,
<br />Abigail and Coquetta</p>

<h1>The Wretchedness of Sin</h1>

<p class="author">Skye Erickson</p>

<p>My life has been one of sorrow, pain, and deep cuts. I was adopted from South Korea when I was five months old. I was welcomed by a lovely couple and two older brothers, who loved me as much as they know how. Unfortunately, my new mother had married at 19 and much too immature for the kind of responsibility it takes to be a wife and mother. She battled with depression and self esteem continually, and was often in her room. My father, mainly, raised us children, with the help of other relatives. He tried to raise us the best he know how. We went to church each Sunday and we probably were thought of as as typical &#8220;Christians.&#8221; We grow up in public schools, watching TV, going to movies, wearing pants, etc. I had a very rebellious spirit, mostly against my mom. I was a chronic stealer. Thank the Lord for taking that out of me! I have no desire to steal whatsoever!</p>

<p>I remember my mom being in her room, while my dad was at work and a maid taking care of us. Although my dad worked a lot, I have many memories of spending time with him. My dad, brothers and I were always alone in family activities, never with my mom, unless we were going to see family members or such. I am very thankful for that time because, after the divorce, I hardly ever saw my dad due to the fact that he had quickly gotten re-married and I was not liked by his new wife. I was about 8 years old, and my mom had told us that she was divorcing my dad. It was a hard time for us all. After the re-marriages, my brothers and I had a strong resentment towards our mother and all that she had done and caused. I went back and forth between homes and finally ended up with my mom. Well, years kept going by. My rebellion kept getting stronger and stronger, as well as my other bad habits. In the sixth grade, I was a little, proud, mean, selfish snob! I was popular and loved to be with my friends. I was hardly at home, but when I was, I was very difficult. I never listened to a word my mom and step-dad told me unless it was to my self-interest. At the end of sixth grade, some friends and I got into some real deep trouble. My parents then decided it best for me to go to my aunt&#8217;s house in Mexico to live for about a year. To me, that year was one of the years that I felt most loved at the time.</p>

<p>When I came back, all the old habits came back with me. Fortunately, I had controlled my stealing habit and hadn&#8217;t stolen anything for a year. Coming home, I found out that my mom was divorced again, which was a relief to me. Since I never listened to my mom, she was unable to control me, and therefore sent me to live with my aunt and uncle near Salem. They were Christians, didn&#8217;t have a TV, they dressed modestly, all the things that were totally opposite from me and how I was raised. Slowly I began to get accustomed to their ways, I was forming new habits, new interests, I was enjoying other godly girls and families that we got together with, etc. Even though I was still rebellious, I knew I needed to obey. The Lord was faithful (and still is faithful!) and was working on my heart during this time. He brought me to a place where I longed to be one of His children. Two weeks before I actually got saved, my aunt asked me what my relationship with the Lord was like, and if I had a desire to live for Him. Well, that is exactly what I needed to really get down to business and repent and get saved. For two weeks, I was constantly praying that the Lord would forgive me of my sins. During those two weeks I was extremely rebellious. As I was diligently seeking salvation, the enemy was working hard to hinder.</p>

<p>Then, it happened, after two long weeks of everyone&#8217;s prayers, the Lord saved me! I believed! Finally, my soul was at peace, I felt like I was walking on clouds! The nights that followed were of peace! For hours, after all had gone to bed, I would lay in bed at night singing all the hymns I knew. Now, as the months have gone by, the Lord has totally changed my life around! Instead of wanting to be a rich, single lawyer, I pray that someday the Lord will allow me to get married, have children, and be a homemaker. About a week after I got saved, a lot of my thoughts reflected back to the people I had done wrong to. The Lord has slowly showed me people that I need to make things right with. To this day, I am still trying to make things right with different ones, as the Lord reveals it to me. The Lord has changed my rebellious heart to a heart that wants to do right and is striving to do the will of God, as well as be obedient to my parents. As I compare back to the first months of my being saved to now, I see a miraculous change! Even in the last month, we all have seen a big change in my behavior, character, and spirit. Long ago I used to love worldly music. I used to listen to it all the time and when I came here, it was hard for me not to be able to listen to it. After I got saved, I prayed for victory to overcome this strong temptation. The Lord is good, and He answered my cry! Now when I hear worldly music, I just start to sing a song that is pleasing to the Lord and I feel blessed! The Lord has taken out of me all the worldly desires that I once had. Just recently I have been praying for better obedience to my elders, more respect, and also more patience. The Lord has answered me; He gave ear unto me; He answered my prayers! I thank Him for the miracle He did in my life! I am confident that the Lord will continue to help me in my walk with Him! Praise God! May the Lord bless your efforts in your newsletter!</p>

<h2>The Choice Is Yours</h2>
<p><i>The Choice Is Yours</i> written by Mary R. Zook, is a variety of true stories for teens. It has been a real blessing and encouragement to me! (Even though I won&#8217;t be 13 till June!) One story that was encouraging to me was the last chapter, &#8220;The Joy of Submission,&#8221; in which a young wife was having trouble in submitting to her husband, and gets help through a older sister and the Lord. I applied the same truth to my situation&#8212;submitting to my parents. It also brings out the effectiveness of prayer and a warning of a froward way. It is an excellent devotion book.</p>

<p>She also wrote <i>The Price of Peace</i>. It was a real blessing to me also. It applies Bible teaching to everyday problems. The main characters range in age from mid-teens to young parents. We enjoyed reading it as a family for devotions. Both books can be purchased from Rod and Staff Publishers, Inc.</p>

<h2>On This Side of the Mountain</h2>
<p><i>On This Side of the Mountain</i> is a story/diary of a boy, named Sam, who wanted to live in the wild. Many years ago, his great-grandfather had bought a mountain of land, but being a sea-faring man, he left it and went back to the sea.</p>

<p>Now Sam really wanted to go live there, but when he asked his father, he laughed and said he could try; but he would probably come home the next night. After Sam had done some research, he left, taking with him some flint, steel, and clothing. Some of the adventures he recorded are: first night outdoors, catching and training Frightful, his falcon, making a house out of a large tree, Dad coming to visit, deer season, and the first snow storm. (You need to read the book to see what else he did!} Hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I did!</p>

<p>There is a sequel, called <i>On the Other Side of the Mountain</i>, but I did not care for it as well.</p>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">(This chapter from Mary Landis&#8217;s book, <i>Dear Princess</i>, was a blessing to me. I read it for my devotions one morning, after I had written about being kind at home, and thought it might be an encouragement to you.&#8212;Ed.)</p>

<h1>My Sister Is a Princess</h1>

<p>Every princess finds herself living in a small, self-contained community. This community is under the roof of her father&#8217;s house. Each member of this little community has his own responsibilities and contribution to make to the whole.</p>

<p>The family, ideally, is a place of love, peace, harmony, security, and close ties that bind each member into a strongly-welded relationship where Christ, the supreme Head, reigns.</p>

<p>Hilda entered the house in a rush. &#8220;Oh, Mother,&#8221; she called as she kicked off her barn boots by the kitchen table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hilda!&#8221; Martha Mae protested sharply. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know better than to come into the kitchen with your barn boots on? You are old enough&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to A. T.,&#8221; Harold teased as he turned from the kitchen washbowl to the towel.</p>

<p>Martha Mae&#8217;s eyes flashed as she looked in his direction. &#8220;Harold,&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;you are making that clean towel perfectly black! You didn&#8217;t wash half the dirt off your arms!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A.T.! A.T.! Assistant Trainer! Assistant Trainer!&#8221; Little Raymond mimicked the chant he had often heard the older ones sing to Martha Mae.</p>

<p>&#8220;Raymond!&#8221; Martha Mae exclaimed sharply. &#8220;I&#8217;ll slap you if you say that once more!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Big Sister&#8217;s mad,&#8221; Harold explained to Raymond in a confidential tone that was intended to reach Martha Mae&#8217;s ears, as he wiped the last gray streak on the kitchen towel. &#8220;You better watch what you say to her when she is feeling this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tears filled Martha Mae&#8217;s eyes. Quickly she turned and fled upstairs to her room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Martha Mae?&#8221; Mother asked as she entered the kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think she&#8217;s gone upstairs to pout,&#8221; Hilda answered lightly.</p>

<p>But Martha Mae had not gone upstairs to pout. In remorse, she crouched, crying, on her knees by the side of her bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Father,&#8221; she prayed and sobbed, &#8220;I&#8217;ve failed to speak kindly to my brothers and sisters again. Oh, what shall I do with my sharp tongue? When will I ever learn to control my temper?&#8221; And Martha Mae sobbed bitterly.</p>

<p>Soon Martha Mae&#8217;s tears subsided and she took a long breath. &#8220;Dear Father, I know the way I talk and feel toward my brothers and sisters is wrong. And Father, I am looking to You to give me the victory over this sin that defeats me daily.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused and took another long quivering breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Father, how should I feel when I&#8217;ve just washed the kitchen floor and they track barn mud across it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fruit of the Spirit is gentleness and longsuffering,&#8221; the Holy Spirit reminded her.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, it&#8217;s not right that they do it,&#8221; Martha Mae protested. &#8220;They must learn&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is Mother&#8217;s place to teach them, not yours,&#8221; came from her conscience again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother has often said that if I would just keep quiet and say nothing she could handle the situation so much more easily,&#8221; Martha Mae admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You keep sweet to your friends no matter what they do,&#8221; her conscience went on relentlessly. &#8220;If Sylvia or Julia had tracked the mud in, you would have laughingly told them it is all right. It is wrong to show more love and kindness to people outside the family than to those who really should be the dearest to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dear friend, have you ever had the same problem that Martha Mae was struggling with? Have you found your patience with your brothers and sisters very short? Have their ways annoyed you and their habits made you angry? Have you spoken to them sharply and in a way that you would be mortified to even think of speaking to someone outside the family?</p>

<p>The real test of our Christian experience is in how we get along with our family at home especially with our brothers and sisters. You may always speak respectfully to Father and Mother. You may show your love by being happily submissive and obedient to them. But how do things go between you and your brothers and sisters? What is your part in the unpleasant scenes that take place there occasionally? How much do you contribute to the friction that spoils the love and happiness in your home?</p>

<p>Do you remember that <span class="scripture">&#8220;a soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+15%3A1" title="Proverbs 15:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 15:1)</span></a></span>?</p>

<p> When you point out a fault in a brother of sister, do you do it in a <span class="scripture">&#8220;spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+6%3A1" title="Galatians 6:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 6:1)</span></a></span>?</p>

<p>Do your attitudes and reactions show the fruit of the Spirit, <span class="scripture">&#8220;love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+5%3A22%2C23" title="Galatians 5:22,23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 5:22,23)</span></a></span>? Do these Christian virtues oil the points of contact between you and your brothers and sisters?</p>

<p>If you honor your mother, you will allow her to instruct and reprove the children, as the Lord has made her responsible to do. Your interference only stirs up resentments and creates new difficulties that magnify her problems many-fold.</p>

<p>The relationship of the true princess with her brothers and sisters is one of helpfulness, sympathetic understanding and a sharing and bearing of all their problems or difficulties.</p>

<p>As a princess you will be a peacemaker. You will not pick on your brothers and sisters. You will refuse to quarrel or dispute.</p>

<p>You will be as courteous to your own brothers and sisters as you are to the brothers and sisters of your friends.</p>

<p>You will not selfishly take advantage of the good nature and kindness of your brothers and sisters, preferring your own advantage in any situation above theirs.</p>

<p>Tell your brothers and sisters that you appreciate what they do for you. Show by thoughtful actions that you love them.</p>

<p>Willingly shoulder your share in the work load, and help to lighten the load for your brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>The princess will acknowledge her mistakes frankly and will apologize for them to her brothers and sisters. She will make wrongs right with those in the home in the same way that she will clear up matters between herself and others outside the home.</p>

<p>The will love by the golden rule, &#8220;Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is the love relationship that the King&#8217;s daughter will seek to maintain with her brothers and sisters in the home. By God&#8217;s grace, she will daily live in such a way that her little sister or brother could freely and happily say, &#8220;My sister is a princess.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Which Loved Best?</h2>
<p class="author">Joy Allison</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;I love you, Mother,&#8221; said little John;<br />Then, forgetting his work, his cap went on,<br />And off he was to the garden swing,<br />Leaving his mother the wood to bring.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;I love you, Mother,&#8221; said rosy Nell,<br />&#8220;I love you better then tongue can tell.&#8221;<br />Then she teased and pouted half the day<br />Till Mother rejoiced when she went to play.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;I love you, Mother,&#8221; said little Fan;<br />Today I&#8217;ll help you all I can;<br />To the cradle then did she softly creep<br />And rocked the baby till it fell fast asleep.</p>

<p class="verse">Then stepping softly, she took the broom,<br />And swept the floor and dusted the room;<br />Busy and happy all day was she,<br />Helpful and cheerful as child could be.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;I love you, Mother,&#8221; again they said,<br />Three little children going to bed;<br />How do you think that the mother guessed<br />Which of them really loved her best?</p>
