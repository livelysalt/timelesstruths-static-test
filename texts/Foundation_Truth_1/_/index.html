<h1>Purpose of <i>Foundation Truth</i></h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Folks,</p>

<p>Greetings in the name of Jesus, our Friend and Redeemer, who gave Himself for us, the guiltless for the guilty, that we might be saved.
Without Him, we can do nothing, but by Him, we can do all things He wants us to do (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+4%3A13">Philippians 4:13</a>).
</p>

<p>We are leaning heavily on the Lord to help us in this task. We want to be of assistance to those who desire to live for God and make heaven their home, and we want to work with the Holy Spirit in stirring and awakening all others to the great necessity of doing so.</p>

<p>That is the purpose of this publication. If we can, by God&#8217;s help, be of usefulness to even one soul, then all labor and effort will be more than repaid.</p>

<p>Now we wish to state that we love everyone, even the vast majority of you whom we have not met. How can we say this? With joy, and an inward assurance, I can declare it because
<span class="scripture">&#8220;the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+5%3A5" title="Romans 5:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 5:5)</span></a></span>
There is no one, at all, whom we resent, or to whom we bear a grudge. We do not have it &#8220;in&#8221; for anyone, nor are we offended at anyone.</p>

<p>A brother once remarked to someone he had never met before that he had a past acquaintance with them of a sort. Then he explained that he was acquainted with God, and God was acquainted with them, and so he had a sort of indirect acquaintance with them. It is because God knows you and loves you, dear reader, that we venture to write and hope. He is able to give what is needed.</p>

<p>We are but fellow pilgrims on the narrow way, rejoicing in our freedom and walking in the light that has shone upon our pathway.
There are things we are persuaded of (deeply) that accompany salvation (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+6%3A9">Hebrews 6:9</a>),
and there are things that we are not certain about. But our trust is in God. He has brought us safely thus far, and we trust Him to lead us safely home.</p>

<p>We could outline a list of what we are convicted of in our heart and a list of questions which occur to our mind. But I am not convinced that it would be profitable for you or for us to do so. Why? In God&#8217;s great plan of guidance and correction, you may not be at the same lesson junctures. It may not make sense at this time, although it may be just what you need at another time. We are asking the Lord to guide us. We are asking Him to hover over the paper as you read it and to assist you in getting hold of what is relevant and profitable, spiritually, to you at the time you read it.</p>

<p>If you feel it is necessary for you to know exactly where we stand on a particular principle, please contact us. Write us or call. But, if you read the paper over an extended period of time, we feel certain you will know, and we trust and hope that it will be of benefit to you.</p>

<p><b>To properly understand the Bible, it is necessary to be under the same Holy Spirit that inspired it to be written.</b> With Brother John, we must be
<span class="scripture">&#8220;in the Spirit&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelations+1%3A10" title="Revelations 1:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelations 1:10)</span></a></span>
to see and know and understand.
Only the Lord can enlighten the eyes of our understanding (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+1%3A18">Ephesians 1:18</a>),
and give skill and understanding (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Daniel+9%3A22%3B+1%3A17">Daniel 9:22; 1:17</a>).
The Lord will teach us to rightly divide the Word of Truth, producing a workman that needeth not to be ashamed (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A15">II&nbsp;Timothy 2:15</a>).
</p>

<p>Having been taught in this way by this wonderful Teacher for some time, we declare with great joy that we are
<span class="scripture">&#8220;not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+1%3A16" title="Romans 1:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 1:16)</span></a></span>
We would happily shout to all the glorious news: <b>IT WORKS!</b> It does just exactly as promised. Not a single part has failed in any way. Hallelujah! It is gloriously true and accurate. In spite of all who have failed to find, the treasure is yet in the field,
and there are those who have paid the full price to buy the same, and are rejoicing in full possession (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+13%3A44">Matthew 13:44</a>).
</p>

<p>If you have been hindered&#8212;if you are disillusioned&#8212;if you are hurt&#8212;bewildered&#8212;confused&#8212;desperate&#8212;in great need&#8212;we would declare to you the results of our own personal experience with God and His way: <b>IT WORKS!</b> And we would say to you, &#8220;Lift up your head. Look and live. <b>It was designed by God Himself to work in your case.</b>&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;For me the promise sure was made,<br />And sealed on Calvary.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/The_Unchanging_Word/index.html" title="The Unchanging Word">*</a></p>

<p>Finally, we ask an interest in your prayers.
Ye who love the Lord, would you help hold up our hands? (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Exodus+17%3A8-13">Exodus 17:8-13</a>).

<h1>To Receive <i>Foundation Truth</i></h1>

<p>We publish <i>Foundation Truth</i> by faith, its only support being free-will offerings that God lays on the hearts of His children to keep this ministry supplied. Therefore, there is no subscription price.</p>

<p>If the Lord lays on your heart to contribute, please make out any checks or money orders to Richard Erickson or Abigail Spinks. <b>We have difficulty depositing any monies made out to <i>Foundation Truth</i> or any other past or present publication name.</b></p>

<p>All scripture quotations are from the King James Version unless otherwise indicated.</p>

<p>We are in the process of transition; hence, although the portion addressed to young women is a well-defined section of the publication, there is not a section specifically dedicated to young men, older men, or older women. Some columns will be regular, and others occasional. The absence of names on articles is not meant to frustrate, but to keep the focus on the message, rather than the messenger. Please pray for us, that the Lord&#8217;s will be accomplished in both format and content.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_1/The_Discussion_Section/index.html">The Discussion Section</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>The Discussion Section</h1>

<p>We have long felt that a discussion section of conflicting doctrines could be done unto edification by the Lord&#8217;s help. Strife and argument are to be avoided&#8212;these will not help us spiritually. Nor do we want to discuss things in a way that will cause others to stumble.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+14%3A1" title="Romans 14:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 14:1)</span></a></span>
We want to help you to live right, not hinder you; nor do we want to be hindered.</p>

<p>We can profitably discuss these things as long as we abide in lowliness of mind, and God blesses our interchanges with lots of grace to all of us.</p>

<p>Many different teachings are held very sincerely and practiced conscientiously. We want you to know that we respect your right to walk in the light that you have&#8212;it is a God-given right and obligation. Still, all these different teachings cannot be right, for truth does not contradict itself. It is to give you and us opportunity to ponder, to pray, to weigh opposing viewpoints, that this effort is being put forth.</p>

<p>Surely, people who love the Lord can soberly assess and evaluate each other&#8217;s understanding without giving way to strife and debate.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;They that feared the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> spake often one to another: and the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before Him for them that feared the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, and that thought upon his name.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Malachi+3%3A16" title="Malachi 3:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Malachi 3:16)</span></a></span>
(See also <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Malachi+3%3A17-18">verses 17-18</a>.)</p>

<p>Now, there are two things I would like to bring to your attention here. One: this is a moderated discussion. It is not a free-for-all. We hope that the very fact of it being in print and appearing at approximately three month intervals will bring a considered deliberation to what you submit and what we accept.</p>

<p>How will we decide what to accept? We want to be as fair as possible. First, we will pray about it. Many things that seem suitable to us may not be appropriate at the time or even not at all. We want to be led by the Lord. It is His publication; we trust Him to guide it and take care of it.</p>

<p>Is the submitted material lacking in charity and courtesy? We will edit accordingly. Is it clear? That is, does it communicate the points made in a way that will be helpful for consideration? Let all things be done unto edification. As long as the Lord&#8217;s approval is on the discussion, almost anything can be discussed to profit. If that blessing is no longer felt, it is time to stop the discussion, regardless of human interest, etc.</p>

<p>Secondly: we expect to participate in the discussion from time to time. And we hope, by the grace of God, to be an example to other participators in brotherly kindness, humility, longsuffering, brevity, and honesty. When you think of us, pray that we will.</p>

<p>We would remind all, including ourselves, that we stand or fall by the Word of God. All preaching, all teaching comes down to this: is it the Word of God, or is it not?</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves. Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+2%3A3-4" title="Philippians 2:3-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 2:3-4)</span></a></span></p>

<h1>The Changed-Heart Religion</h1>

<p>If you are interested in finding what is really truth&#8212;what the Bible really teaches, then the subject of this article will be of great interest to you.</p>

<p>After dealing with the backsliding of the children of Israel, warning them of sure judgement for their sins and transgressions, the Lord promised a remedy for their unconverted and hardened hearts.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+36%3A26-27" title="Ezekiel 36:26-27"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ezekiel 36:26-27)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>We see from this promise that God is in the business of actually changing people&#8217;s hearts. God is able to operate on the cold, hard, stony heart with no love for right or for Him and change it into a soft, warm, responsive heart, full of love for the things of God and everyone else. What a mighty God we serve! A willful, wicked heart into a submissive, obedient heart. Praise His Name!</p>

<p>At the time that Ezekiel penned these words, the promise was in the future. Turning to the New Testament, we quickly find that the brethren of that day found it a blessed reality.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A16-17" title="Hebrews 10:16-17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 10:16-17)</span></a></span>
The writer of Hebrews is quoting the Old Testament promise as a current possession. He regards the promise as fulfilled in his heart and the hearts of others. Now, he states, they have
<span class="scripture">&#8220;a true heart.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A22" title="Hebrews 10:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 10:22)</span></a></span>
Earlier, the brother states that this entire new covenant is established upon better promises than were obtainable before the New Testament. And what is the nature of these better promises?
<span class="scripture">&#8220;This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+8%3A1" title="Hebrews 8:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 8:1)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>The testimony of the Apostle Paul to the Corinthian brethren:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+3%3A3" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 3:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 3:3)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>The testimony of the Apostle Peter to the gathering at Jerusalem, describing both the experiences of the gentiles and their own:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us; And put no difference between us and them, <b>purifying their hearts by faith</b>.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+15%3A8-9" title="Acts 15:8-9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 15:8-9)</span></a></span>
The New Testament not only emphatically teaches a changed heart, but a changed heart that is subsequently purified, as well.</p>

<p>In
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+18%3A3">Matthew 18:3</a>,
Jesus stresses the absolute need of a heart change in the following words:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.&#8221;</span>
When does this conversion take place?
When we repent, when our sins are blotted out (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+3%3A19">Acts 3:19</a>).
When our sins are forgiven (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+4%3A12">Mark 4:12</a>).</p>

<p>It is so great a change, a change wrought by God in the heart of an individual, that it is referred to as being <i>born again</i>. Nicodemus did not understand this, although a master in Israel, <b>because he had not the experience</b>. As Jesus told him,

<p>If God has changed your heart in this Biblical fashion, you do not need to be persuaded of the reality of the experience. You already have the testimony. But, dear reader, if you are lacking in this crucial aspect, be warned:

<h2>A Godly Life as Distinguished From a Good, Moral Life</h2>
<p>Many people are trying to live a Bible life without a changed heart. They are attracted to the beauty and virtue of a godly life and try their very best to live such a life. It does not work as it reads in their Bible.
Their faith stands in the wisdom of men instead of the power of God (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+2%3A5">I&nbsp;Corinthians 2:5</a>).
The blessing is not there as it should be. There is no real victory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">One evening after preaching on the subject of heavenly life, a gentleman said to me, &#8220;I have been a member of a church for thirty years. I have had pastors capable of giving instructions in the divine life, and I have tried to live a Christian life, but have utterly failed. Can you tell me the cause of my failure?&#8221;</p>

<p>We told him that we thought we could. We asked him if a fig tree could bear olive berries?</p>

<p>He replied, &#8220;I get your meaning. Is it possible I have been trying to live a life I did not possess?&#8221;</p>

<p>That was his trouble, and it has been the trouble with many another. <b>You cannot live an heavenly life if you do not possess the life.</b></p>

<p>Simon forsook his magic, was baptized, attended services, and counted himself a Christian. But something came out of his unconverted soul that plainly revealed that his

How serious! How solemn! If your heart is not right in the sight of God, thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter.</p>

<p>Oh, be assured, dear reader, that the Bible requires a pure heart&#8212;a failure on your part to get the Bible promise fulfilled in you will result in you missing heaven, for

<blockquote>
<p class="first">You may be able to live a good, moral life; you might have an exterior life good enough to hold the confidence of man, but holy living comes from the living Word of God hidden in the heart. Holy living is not only the refraining from doing the wrong and the doing of the right, but it is the refraining from doing the wrong from an inward principle of holy hatred of the wrong inwrought in the heart by the Holy Spirit, and a doing of the right in the life and holiness of God. It is more than the good deeds done by human life; it is good deeds done by the life of God in the human life. There is a vast difference. There is danger, great danger, in holiness professors attending to the outward life to the neglect of the inward life. So long as they do not do anything wrong, and so long as they do things that are right they think themselves safe. We can live good lives and, like the church at Ephesus, lose the love of God out of the soul. <b>Right living may be only man in action; holy living is God in action.</b></p>

<h2>The Old Testament Experience</h2>
<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, <b>can never with those sacrifices</b> which they offered year by year continually <b>make the comers thereunto perfect</b>.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A1" title="Hebrews 10:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 10:1)</span></a></span>
Here the divinely-inspired writer plainly states the limitations of the Old Testament (the Mosaic law) experience. In the next verse, he contends:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers <i>once purged</i> should have had no more conscience of sins.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A2" title="Hebrews 10:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 10:2)</span></a></span>
And then he plainly states the truth of the Old Testament sacrifice system,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats <b>should take away sins</b>.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A4" title="Hebrews 10:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 10:4)</span></a></span>
He then goes on in the chapter to present the precious truth that a better sacrifice (even our Lord Jesus) was given that we might have a better heart experience.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all&#8230;. For by one offering, he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A10%2C14-15" title="Hebrews 10:10,14-15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 10:10,14-15)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Again, the writer of Hebrews states that
<span class="scripture">&#8220;while as the first tabernacle was yet standing&#8230;&#8203;in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, <b>that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience</b>.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+9%3A8-9" title="Hebrews 9:8-9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 9:8-9)</span></a></span>
And again he contrasts the old experience with the new, available under Christ.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;How much more shall <b>the blood of Christ</b>, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, <b>purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God</b>?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+9%3A14" title="Hebrews 9:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 9:14)</span></a></span>
The same thought is presented in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+8%3A6-8">Hebrews 8:6-8</a>.
Here, Jesus is declared to be the mediator (the go-between between God and man) of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises. The first covenant is declared to be lacking, so a second was made. What is the difference?
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+8%3A10" title="Hebrews 8:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 8:10)</span></a></span>
In other words, the difference between the Old Testament experience and the New Testament is the difference in an unchanged heart and a changed heart. In the former, the laws were not written in the heart, but in tablets of stone. In the latter, the laws are written in fleshly tables of the heart. Thus is the prophecy fulfilled,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+60%3A21" title="Isaiah 60:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 60:21)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>A pure heart will produce a pure life,
for out of the heart are the issues of life (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+4%3A23">Proverbs 4:23</a>).
Yea,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;a good man, out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+6%3A45" title="Luke 6:45"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 6:45)</span></a></span>
The fruit of the life is produced by the inward condition of the heart.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherefore, by their fruits ye shall know them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+7%3A20" title="Matthew 7:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 7:20)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>The story of the Old Testament saints is the narrative of those who set themselves to live for God with an unregenerate heart. And because their heart&#8217;s moral condition was not inwardly according to the fervent desire of their love for God, they were much hindered and failed continually. After David failed the Lord and sinned, as he agonized over his sin, the eyes of his understanding were opened, and he realized that
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Thou desirest <b>truth in the inward parts</b>: and <b>in the hidden part</b> thou shalt make me to know wisdom.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+51%3A6" title="Psalm 51:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 51:6)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>How forcibly the words of the New Testament writer apply:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, <b>received not the promise: God having provided some better thing for us</b>.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+11%3A39-40" title="Hebrews 11:39-40"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 11:39-40)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>It is that
<span class="scripture">&#8220;better thing&#8221;</span>
that God has provided, dear reader, which is obtainable by faith in the
<span class="scripture">&#8220;better sacrifice.&#8221;</span>
</p>

<h2>Specific, Definite Faith in the Promises of God</h2>
<p>The entire Bible emphatically teaches that God has made believing the condition of receiving. Therefore,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Without faith, it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+11%3A6" title="Hebrews 11:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 11:6)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Before we can believe, we must know. There must be a grasp of the promise.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+10%3A17" title="Romans 10:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 10:17)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Now mankind
<span class="scripture">&#8220;did not like to retain God in their knowledge,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+1%3A28" title="Romans 1:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 1:28)</span></a></span>
and, as they lived to their flesh, gross darkness (ignorance) covered the people. Generation after generation went on in this way, living in rebellion against that which was right, and losing consciousness of the difference between what was right and what was wrong. The effect of all being under sin (even those who did not want to be, and who struggled against it), produced an overall condition described in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+3%3A10-18">Romans 3:10-18</a>.
Verse 11 tells us,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;There is <b>none that understandeth</b>, there is none that seeketh after God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+3%3A11" title="Romans 3:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 3:11)</span></a></span>
That is, there were none who understood how to seek after God <b>in a way that was acceptable to Him</b>. Those who tried to live right were unable to escape being <i>under sin</i>. Their heart condition hindered their understanding and their faith.
As the Samaritan woman at the well, they worshipped that they knew not what, and knew not how to worship in spirit and in truth (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+4%3A22-24">John 4:22-24</a>).
This was no possibility at all that this condition would reverse itself without Divine intervention.</p>

<p>How merciful is our God! He gave the Law by Moses. Why? There were two reasons.
It was given to restrain sin by acquainting men with the nature of God (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+1%3A9">I&nbsp;Timothy 1:9</a>).
It was given to lay a foundation for faith in God. In this sense,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+3%3A2" title="Galatians 3:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 3:2)</span></a></span>
It was preparatory.</p>

<p>The great fairness and justice of God is herein manifest. If Jesus had come in the time of Moses, hardly anyone could have been able to manifest faith in the fullness of salvation. The gap was too wide; too much had been lost. The stirring, educating effect of the law and the story of men&#8217;s attempts to live right with an unchanged heart, with an increasing appreciation of what it meant to please God, were all necessary before God sent His beloved Son into the world.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But when the <i>fullness</i> of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+4%3A4" title="Galatians 4:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 4:4)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>We can conclude that the Lord was laying a foundation for our faith. So, now it can be joyfully declared,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A3" title="Hebrews 10:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 10:3)</span></a></span>
And, oh, what a rich and full foundation hath been laid for your benefit and mine!
<span class="scripture">&#8220;According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these [through faith in these promises] ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+1%3A3-4" title="II&nbsp;Peter 1:3-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 1:3-4)</span></a></span>
My soul doth magnify the Lord&#8212;how great is His salvation&#8212;how blessed those who receive the promise!</p>

<p class="verse">How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,
<br />Is laid for your faith in His excellent word!
<br />What more can He say than to you He hath said&#8212;
<br />To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled?<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/How_Firm_a_Foundation/index.html" title="How Firm a Foundation">*</a></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+15%3A4" title="Romans 15:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 15:4)</span></a></span>
The objective of all this carefully-laid foundation was to bring a solid assurance, a definite faith, in the experiences of all who loved the Lord with all the heart, the understanding, the soul, the mind, and the strength. Listen to this definite testimony faith:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people; A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+2%3A29-32" title="Luke 2:29-32"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 2:29-32)</span></a></span>
This man had been feeding on the scriptures, and his faith was inspired in such a definite way that
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Joseph and his [Jesus&#8217;] mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+2%3A33" title="Luke 2:33"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 2:33)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Let us reflect that God had sent His Word to inspire in us this same spirit of faith. How much it means to get a hold of His promises in this way!
To enter into His covenant with Him (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+50%3A5">Psalm 50:5</a>)!.
Dear reader, He is seeking for those who will worship Him in spirit and in truth.</p>

<p>
The whole purpose of the Law by Moses was to point to a new and better way, established upon better promises (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+8%3A6">Hebrews 8:6</a>).
And this was portrayed to all in such a way that
<span class="scripture">&#8220;the just shall live by faith&#8221;</span>,
and that we might be
<span class="scripture">&#8220;of them that believe to the saving of the soul.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A38-39" title="Hebrews 10:38-39"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 10:38-39)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Definite believing; definite faith in the definite promises. God is pleased to make <b>believing the condition of receiving</b>. Definite faith, established on the immutability of God&#8217;s promises, will bring about definite results from God, completely in harmony with His Will and His Word. How wonderful that God is
<span class="scripture">&#8220;willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+6%3A1" title="Hebrews 6:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 6:1)</span></a></span>
The result, in the hearts of believers:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us: Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+6%3A18-19" title="Hebrews 6:18-19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 6:18-19)</span></a></span>
Be assured, reader, that God has prepared for you a foundation of understanding which is capable of giving you this
<span class="scripture">&#8220;strong consolation&#8221;</span>
and
<span class="scripture">&#8220;anchor of the soul.&#8221;</span>
How wonderful! How perfectly He doeth all things!
<span class="scripture">&#8220;He hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+1%3A8" title="Ephesians 1:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 1:8)</span></a></span>
His plan of salvation is perfectly adapted to the great need of all mankind. It satisfies the soul.</p>

<p><b>Most people do not receive a definite heart cleansing because they are hindered in exercising a definite faith in the Word of God.</b> Their experience is vague because their faith is vague. Their hope is based on some other assurance than the promises of God. What they receive is not what God wants to give, and their lives do not shine with the light of regeneration. Some other spirit than the Holy Spirit guides them, and they produce a different fruit than the result of the heavenly experience of being born from above. A friend of mine in a sectarian organization once remarked of the people in the place where he lived, &#8220;They tell them they are saved, and then try to get them to act like saved people.&#8221; He was saved himself and had gotten the real experience in his heart. He saw there was a great difference between profession and possession.</p>

<h2>The Old Testament-New Testament Pattern Repeated Over and Over in Every Child</h2>
<p>In a certain sense, every child raised in a Godly home, who finds an experience of salvation, goes through the Old Testament foundation, and then is stirred to find and obtain a New Testament experience. (Sad, indeed, is the disadvantage of those who have not either.)</p>

<p>No matter how much the parents of such a child love the Lord, and no matter how holy they are living before God, the child is born in sin&#8212;that is, inherited sin, the depravity that all of us (except Jesus) inherit because of Adam&#8217;s transgression.
Death (spiritual death) reigns over all (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+5%3A14">Romans 5:14</a>).
This inherited propensity to do wrong is not something for which we are personally responsible. But its existence in our heart puts us at extreme disadvantage in the battle between doing right and doing wrong. All men, everywhere, lose this battle. Except for Jesus, who had pure heart from conception through all His earthly existence in the body,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;<i>all</i> have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+3%3A23" title="Romans 3:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 3:23)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Modern philosophy and conventional wisdom ignore this primary fact. To a great extent, the proponents of these ideas hardly believe in sin (except perhaps the grosser forms of sin). The sad results of ignoring the great fact of depravity in the heart has greatly helped the enemy of mankind produce the conditions in the world today.</p>

<p>Carnality in the heart produces different manifestations. Some are remarkably willful, others are sneaky and deceitful. Still others seem good and are easy to manage, but have a terrible strong pull to pride and bigotry, hypocrisy. Some covet, while others desire dominion above their fellows. Some are drawn to envy, that deadly and implacable sin, while others are enchanted with vanity.</p>

<p>All are hindered by their spiritual condition from getting a hold of the gospel and finding deliverance. As their innocence is lost through transgression, and acquired sins are added to inherited tendencies, all the fruit of a sinful life begins production in the little lives and hearts.</p>

<p>Parents who love the Lord, and who realize the consequences of a sinful life, labor hard to impress a code of conduct on the young minds. The end result is stressed. They are taught to pray to Him with whom we have to do. Correction and reproof are employed; the chastening rod is applied. A sense of honor and of duty are fashioned. Diligent and careful management are used to train up the child in the way in which he/she should go. The emotions are touched. Habits are formed. Patterns of thought are carefully shaped.</p>

<p>It has an effect&#8212;a lifelong effect. When the child is old, the effects of the training will still be observable. <b>But it does not produce spirituality; it does not bring the soul to regeneration; it does not produce life in the soul; it does not make us ready for heaven.</b> It surrounds the carnal nature and the guilty soul with good training and knowledge of excellent precepts, <b>but it does not change the heart</b>. All this Old Testament kind of preparation is necessary to lay a foundation, to serve as a schoolmaster <b>to bring us to Christ</b>, but it does not bring the results that God has appointed to be brought by believing faith unless that individual actually exercises their will and seeks what God has for them.
This they would never do except the Spirit of God strives with man (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+6%3A44">John 6:44</a>),
and the Spirit and the Bride say come (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+22%3A17">Revelation 22:17</a>).
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And let him that heareth say, Come.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+22%3A1" title="Revelation 22:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 22:1)</span></a></span>
There must be an <i>affirmative</i> answer in the heart of the one who is dealt with, too. This is where faith is inspired to grasp the promises and obtain the result&#8212;a work of God in the heart that utterly changes it.</p>

<p>Now to a soul who has been well taught and who finds the reality of Christ&#8217;s saving grace in the soul, he
<span class="scripture">&#8220;is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things <i>new</i> and <i>old</i>.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+13%3A52" title="Matthew 13:52"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 13:52)</span></a></span>
What he knew before in the mind and emotion takes on a far deeper significance now. The <i>old</i> becomes valuable with the <i>new</i>. Indeed, the <i>old</i> has become <i>new</i>. All of life has become new; he is a new creature. Old things have passed away (the old sinful things), and all things have become new. Hallelujah! The motive of the heart is different. It <b>is now done</b> for love of Jesus, a love planted in the heart by operation of the Spirit of God; it <b>was done</b> for another reason before. Oh, the transforming power of the gospel! It will take an Old Testament experience and transform it into a New Testament experience. It will take a second-hand religion, constructed by borrowing and leaning on another, and give you a first-hand heart-to-heart connection to God. It will connect you to the Vine. The heavenly sap will flow through your soul and produce the heavenly fruit in your life.</p>

<h1>&#8220;How Do I Mend This?&#8221;</h1>

<p>This question came up after I volunteered to help a young mother mend something while we were visiting. How that stack of mending can pile up with a growing family! This is kind of embarrassing to say&#8212;but I have had a child to grow out of a garment before I got it mended! In the last few years, I have learned to do the hand mending during our family&#8217;s literature time in the evening, while my husband reads.</p>

<p>A mother once brought her daughter to our home to have some time with our daughters making greeting cards. Do you know what the mother brought along? Her mending! I was impressed with her forethought and organization!</p>

<p>It is our desire that in this column we mothers can be of help one to another. If you have a question, feel free to ask. If we don&#8217;t know, we will try to find the answer or maybe some of our readers can help us out. If you have a hint that has been a blessing to you, please share it with us.</p>

<p>In looking up the subject of mending at the library, I found only two books. <i>Mend It</i>, and <i>The Mender&#8217;s Manual</i>. Of the two, the latter one is the best, but unfortunately it is out-of-print. The author, Estelle Foote, was a chairman of a small mending committee who helped underprivileged folks by collecting, mending and giving out good used clothing. Through her nine years of welfare mending, many tough problems were worked out. She has written and illustrated this book for others to benefit from, and we hope to share some of the ideas with you.</p>

<p>One of the first things she tells us is that hand mending is much like embroidery stitches.</p>

<p>So if you are unfamiliar with hand stitching, get a good book on embroidery stitches and keep it handy.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with sewing on a button where the fabric underneath is torn (Fig. A). Sometimes the button may slip inside the facing. Let&#8217;s pull the button out and take it off. Take a small patch of fabric, a little larger than the tear, and slip inside the facing, under the hole. Take a needle and thread, and with point of needle, push under the frayed edges, whip-stitching to the patch underneath as you go (Fig. B). For extra reinforcement, machine stitch on the darning setting or use a good patching stitch as illustrated (Fig. C). Remember not to run the stitches back very far from the edge, or they will show when the garment is buttoned. Sew the button back on and the garment is ready to wear again.</p>

<p>When sewing on a button, note the thread color of the other buttons and match it as closely as possible. Remember not to sew it on too tightly or it will be difficult to fasten and will also pucker the top and bottom fabrics. To prevent this, slide a large pin, needle or toothpick between fabric and button. Pull it out after the button is sewn on. At this point, wind the thread around the loose stitching two or three times, between button and material, and secure it with a knot. I have also found that putting a drop of &#8220;Fray Check&#8221; on the knot will also keep that button on!</p>

<p>If you are sewing a button on a coat or other heavy garment&#8212;consider sewing a small button on the wrong side, underneath. This will help keep the cloth from tearing under strain.</p>

<p>Another valuable suggestion is sewing buttons on with elastic cord if they are in a place subjected to strain. They would &#8220;give&#8221; more and the button would tend to stay on longer than when sewed on with unyielding thread. Do not try to pull the elastic cord through to the wrong side; just sew it to the outside of the fabric under the button.</p>

<p>A common place for undue strain is at the bottom of a dress that buttons all the way down the front. So you can try sewing this button on with elastic cord; or you can also substitute a strong snap fastener, and then sew the button on the outside, over the buttonhole.</p>

<p>One mother solved this problem by simply stitching up from the hemline going past the last button! This is an excellent idea for active little girls! No more rips to mend, and it is more modest, too.</p>

<p>May the Lord bless you as you endeavor to serve your family in this humble but needful task. The Lord hath said,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren [or sisters], ye have done it unto me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+25%3A40" title="Matthew 25:40"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 25:40)</span></a></span>

<h1>Paying the Price: The Greenhouse Story</h1>

<p>Several years ago our family talked and planned about building some type of greenhouse, and finally concluded that the best idea was to enclose a porch area in front of our family room, making a combination mudroom/greenhouse. We talked to a friend who worked in the county building inspections department, describing in vague, general terms our idea of putting up walls and a short roof extension to enclose this porch area. We had no final idea at the time of our plans, and our friend thought we probably didn&#8217;t need a permit for what we described. Just in case, he attempted to fax to me at my work a copy of the building code to examine for myself, but the fax didn&#8217;t come through successfully, and I didn&#8217;t follow up on it. We began work with the help of a contractor friend in February, 1997, pouring a concrete stem wall on top of the existing concrete patio. Work progressed very slowly, and the framing was not complete until the end of summer. We had two rooms, a concrete utility sink we set up to extend plumbing to someday, and as our rainy winter weather set in, we finally managed to get the walls and roof up. We put in two skylights and some RV vents in the roof, again with the help of our contractor friend, and finally got felt on so it was more or less waterproof.</p>

<p>During the last couple months of working on the project, I began to get uneasy in my mind about the legal aspects of this. We were planning to get electricity put in, and I knew that I would need a permit for that. I also knew that the original project had grown considerably, and I began to feel that a building permit might be required for this size of a project. The Lord began to talk to me about it&#8212;in my personal devotions, in sermons, and even in some of my evening visits with my children. I prayed until I saw that I needed to be sure that I was in obedience to the governing authorities. I could not find anything about following the requirements of the local building authority which would require me to disobey God. This certainly qualified as
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Render[ing] to Caesar the things that are Caesar&#8217;s.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+12%3A17" title="Mark 12:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 12:17)</span></a></span>
I committed my way to the Lord, willing to do whatever it took to be clear before Him, and called the county. I described the work, and asked if a permit were required for such a thing. The answer was a certain &#8220;yes,&#8221; and then it began to get interesting. I felt that I needed to turn myself in for violating the code and accept the consequences. I made several attempts, via phone and then in person, bringing a picture of the nearly complete project. Each person there showed no curiosity about what I had done, only making sure that I wasn&#8217;t working on building anything right then without a permit. My picture was handed back to me, barely glanced at. I was instructed to submit my building plans to a plans examiner, who would show me whether I needed any adjustments. It became evident that everyone I was encountering was trying to avoid getting me in trouble, and I found it to continue to be true throughout the entire process that they wanted to help me. So I submitted, as plans, the actual layout of what I had done, and there were four significant items not meeting code, including the foundation itself. The Lord began to show me that this was going to be a large spiritual lesson for me, in paying whatever price necessary to be right with the Lord, and in getting a taste of how much this could cost some people.</p>

<p>The first inspection wasn&#8217;t due for six months, so I had time to wait for fair weather to begin the demolition work. There is something that breaks inside a man (I believe the word for it is &#8220;pride&#8221;) when he has to destroy something he has labored a great deal over, and perhaps for some, the first project of any type has a sentimental attachment as well. There seemed to be quite a bit of snapping going on inside of me as I took apart the structure, salvaging what I could to reuse. At the same time I found inside myself a great sense of God&#8217;s approval.</p>

<p>The foundation needed to be much more substantial than I had realized. I needed to dig down over three times the depth of the original concrete slab, and the practical experience of going through the labor and time necessary to build a foundation meeting standard brought home to me the extreme importance of building my spiritual foundation &#8220;according to code&#8221; more than almost anything else could.</p>

<p>The plumbing was much more involved than I had realized as well, and I hired a plumber for that portion of the project. Once the &#8220;under the slab&#8221; plumbing work was complete, we did our concrete work in two stages. The first was for the foundation, and the second for the stemwall. The stemwall we designed higher than the original, based on our experiences with the first. In both &#8220;pours&#8221; we encountered unexpected challenges which we eventually overcame. The framing work went fairly quickly, and I built it with more care and accuracy the second time, using better materials as well. We also found from our earlier experience that it was better to have a single room instead of two. It was February, 1999, before I was completing my roof, and the following summer before we completed all our trim work.</p>

<p>The completed structure cost several thousand more dollars than originally planned, but it was better built, better suited to our purposes, and my conscience was clear. It was worth the price in time, money and humility for a clear conscience alone. It is always worth the price for a clear conscience, whether you have to completely tear out what you&#8217;ve &#8220;built&#8221; into your life or not. When we submit ourselves to the Lord, He supplies the grace for whatever trials and tribulations we must go through to obey Him. I&#8217;m grateful for the Lord&#8217;s goodness to me, and for the lessons in humility, patience and obedience that the Lord taught me with our greenhouse.</p>

<h1>Hindrances to Spiritual Fellowship</h1>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;He went on frowardly in the way of his heart.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+57%3A17" title="Isaiah 57:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 57:17)</span></a></span></p>

<p>From time to time, we have known dear precious souls who had a love for God and for whom God had done some wonderful things. They possessed some valuable attributes of character and were walking in all the light that they had. Some of them had less light than others, and some of them had been walking with God in honesty for a while, whereas others had just gotten started.</p>

<p>We cannot recall any occasion of meeting such dear ones without recalling the great joy that welled up in our heart. In each case, the expectation was the same&#8212;an intense hope that they would continue to walk in the light and &#8220;go all the way&#8221; with the Lord, just as far as the Spirit of God would lead them.</p>

<p>For we knew, according to
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1%3A7">I&nbsp;John 1:7</a>,
that an individual walking in the light (as He is in the light) is the basis of all fellowship with God and with each other. And we longed and still long to be with all who love God and His Truth above anything else,and who prove it by
paying any price to buy the Truth (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+23%3A23">Proverbs 23:23</a>).
</p>

<p>We wish we could tell you that each and every situation has turned out well, but we cannot. Indeed, most of them have not.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+10%3A2" title="Mark 10:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 10:2)</span></a></span>
His possessions were not really very great at all, as compared to the riches of the Kingdom of Heaven, but he did not see that. <b>He loved his possessions more than truth.</b> This has always been the problem. There is something that matters more than a clear, definite consciousness that everything is all right between you and God. As long as this is true, you cannot be led by the Spirit of God&#8212;you will be led by the voices of other things.</p>

<p>In
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+14%3A18-20">Luke 14:18-20</a>,
we are given a list of things that meant more than God&#8217;s requirements. One was listening to the voice of lands, so he must needs disregard the voice of God. Another had acquired some new agricultural equipment, and the voice of his vocation prevented him. Still another put his marriage ahead of God. And so it goes;
<span class="scripture">&#8220;they all with one consent began to make excuse.&#8221;</span>
Evidently, they&#8217;d had some connection with God, for they were the first invited to the feast. But their true spiritual condition becomes apparent when we read,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+12%3A2" title="Romans 12:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 12:2)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>We are satisfied that it is utterly impossible to be led by the Spirit of God if we are not fully surrendered to Him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">There is a way out of all these difficulties, to the fully surrendered soul. I would repeat, fully surrendered, because <b>if there is any reserve of will upon any point, it becomes almost impossible to find out the mind of God in reference to that point;</b> and therefore the first thing is to be sure that you really do purpose to obey the Lord in every respect. If however this is the case, and your soul only needs to know the will of God in order to consent to it, then you surely cannot doubt His willingness to make His will known, and to guide you in the right paths.</p>

<p>Now, hardly anyone that I know who has backed up on God, and stopped walking in the light they were given from heaven, has admitted it. Most seem to balk at some thing that they do not want to do, and they seek to minimize it in their minds. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t really matter to the Lord&#8230;.&#8221; Only, as time proves, it does. The fruit that is eventually borne in the life that walks away rather than in, proves it. At first, some of the excuses may have the appearance of being plausible and may make a brave showing in the flesh. But if we heed the Bible admonition to
<span class="scripture">&#8220;prove all things; hold fast that which is good,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+5%3A21" title="I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:21)</span></a></span>
then
<span class="scripture">&#8220;ye shall know them by their fruits.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+7%3A16" title="Matthew 7:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 7:16)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>It is exceedingly dangerous to trifle with any point of truth, once we are convicted that it is truth. Wavering, disputing and arguing with God will open you to a spirit of deception. It is extremely dangerous not to obey the Bible.</p>

<p>In the cases mentioned above, something would begin to manifest itself&#8212;something that is not according to the Word of God and contrary to it. One family was in violation of the Scriptures on a certain point, and we were unaware of it. In due time, it came out. We could not accept them without being a partaker of their sin. After a long time of waiting and praying, we put before them
<span class="scripture">&#8220;the words of this life,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+5%3A20" title="Acts 5:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 5:20)</span></a></span>
as gently and clearly as we could, asking them if the Lord had ever dealt with them on this point. They were highly offended and broke off all contact at all levels, thus sadly informing us of the answer to our question. We love them yet, but we still love the truth of God&#8217;s Word even more, and we continue to pray for them.</p>

<p>In another case, there seemed to be some real merit from heaven in their lives, and they had obeyed the Lord in a matter at real cost to themselves. Surely, we thought, here are folks who want to follow the Lord all the way. But, after a little contact, a certain lack of warmth and fellowship was noticed, and we did not know why. Then, from time to time, certain false notes were heard. A lack of vision was apparent. It brought a heavy burden of prayer. It seemed they had entered into another spirit and accepted it. But, then that was removed, and to our amazement, they reversed and went back on certain key aspects of their stand before. Our heart is deeply grieved for them. Beyond doubt, they are not being led by the Spirit of God.</p>

<p><b>How impossible it is for those who are not led by the Spirit of God to fit in with those who are.</b></p>

<p>Men&#8217;s organizations do not have this problem. They are created by people and run by people, and people, led by the priorities and values of the natural man, can find a suitable home for the condition of their heart.</p>

<p>But
God&#8217;s people, who were once not a people (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+2%3A10">I&nbsp;Peter 2:10</a>),
are a people identified and defined by their supreme love for God and His ways.
By a marvelous Divine operation, His laws are written in their very hearts and minds (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+8%3A10%2C+10%3A16">Hebrews 8:10, 10:16</a>),
and this produces a people who must have and who&#8212;praise His precious Name&#8212;do have

<h1>&#8220;People That Don&#8217;t Serve the Lord Miss So Much&#8221;</h1>

<p>My friend, Ed, was a finish carpenter who started learning the trade later in life. He was quite intellectually interested in the process of becoming an accepted master of his craft. His father had been a general carpenter for many years, and had given him this advice:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are respectful and humble, these older men will go out of their way to help you. If you act like you think you know a lot, they won&#8217;t tell you anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had been at this learning curve for a few years, clearly out of the apprentice stage, and probably well into the journeyman, when we had occasion to discuss some things. He had some errands to run, so we decided to do our visiting on the road. He stopped at the modest, unpretentious home of a master craftsman, a man renowned throughout the large metropolitan area for his great expertise and lightning speed in building wooden railings for spiraling staircases. Even to my untutored eye, there was something impressive about the man. Ed told me later that he was constantly sought by others, who offered him large sums of money to teach them what he knew. He wouldn&#8217;t take any of them.</p>

<p>This man showed us a shaper sharpener that he had designed because he couldn&#8217;t find what he wanted. It was ingenious, and of a larger size by far than normal. Laughing at the memory, he told us of the first time that he turned the thing on in a house with a crew. It sounded like an airplane propeller, and one fellow thought it was fixing to fly apart. He ran out of there&#8230;.</p>

<p>It was very interesting, and at the last of our visit with him, he showed us how he had fixed two window air conditioning units. It was quite interesting, indeed, to see this master craftsman in wood manifest the self-satisfaction that he got from figuring out something rather remote from his vocation.</p>

<p>Some months went by, and Ed was visiting in my home. &#8220;Do you remember that man we visited that day?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>I nodded. I certainly did.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mark, for some reason that fellow has taken a liking to me. He has actually gone out of his way to show me things&#8212;things that are worth literally tens of thousands of dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at my friend. I had some idea of what this meant to him. I knew how he had prayed over his first vocation. When he left it, he said the Lord spoke to him and said, &#8220;I gave you your first job, and you didn&#8217;t like it very well. What would you like to do now?&#8221; And he told the Lord, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to build houses.&#8221; So the Lord had opened a way for him in that area.</p>

<p>My friend was staring directly at me, and the water stood in his eyes. &#8220;Mark,&#8221; he said huskily, &#8220;people that don&#8217;t serve the Lord miss so much.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;The steps of a good man are ordered by the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>: and he delighteth in his way.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+37%3A23" title="Psalm 37:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 37:23)</span></a></span></p>

<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_1/What_Do_Religions_Offer_Womanhood/index.html">What Do Religions Offer Womanhood?</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>What Do Religions Offer Womanhood?</h1>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">BUDDHISM looks at woman thus: &#8220;Just as when the disease called mildew falls upon the field of rice in fine condition, that field of rice does not continue long; just so under whatsoever doctrine and discipline women are allowed, that religion will not last long. Bad conduct is the taint of women. Verily, the life of women is always darkness.&#8221;</p>

<p>ISLAM: &#8220;Men are superior to women on account of the qualities which God hath gifted the one above the other. Ye may divorce your wives twice; and then either retain them with humanity or dismiss them with kindness. Of other women who seem good to your eyes, take two, or three, or four.&#8221;</p>

<p>CONFUCIANISM: &#8220;The Master said, &#8216;Of all people, girls and servants are the most difficult to behave to. If you are familiar with them, they lose their humility. If you maintain a reserve toward them, they are discontented. The woman follows and obeys the man. In her youth, she follows her father and elder brother. When married, she follows her son.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>HINDUISM: &#8220;With women there can be no lasting friendship; hearts of hyenas are the hearts of women. The husband should not eat in the presence of his wife. Such indeed is the divine ordinance. Women, the low-caste Sundre, the dog, the blow crow, are untruth. Stealing grain, base metals, or cattle, slaying women and low-caste Sundres, and atheism are all minor offenses.&#8221;</p>

<p>But now let us see what Christ has done for woman.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife; And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+10%3A6-9" title="Mark 10:6-9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 10:6-9)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+3%3A28" title="Galatians 3:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 3:28)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Christian women, would you exchange your Christ for any other religion? Then, do you owe anything to the One who made your exalted position possible? Christian men, are you glad that your mothers and sisters are not held down in a hopeless heathen bondage? The woman in a Christian land enjoys the loftiest position of her kind.</p>

<p>The above article was found in an out-of-print book, <i>Food for the Body and for the Soul</i>. Each time I have read it, my heart fills with deep thanksgiving for Christ&#8217;s love and equality to humankind. There is liberty in Christ. Liberty for the man and liberty for the woman.
God has made a wonderful plan (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A21-31">Ephesians 5:21-31</a>).
He has created us to be help meets to our husbands, to love and submit to them in all things, putting only Himself above that area.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+3%3A1" title="Colossians 3:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 3:1)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A22" title="Ephesians 5:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 5:22)</span></a></span>
The Phillip&#8217;s translation renders it, &#8220;You wives must learn to adapt yourselves to your husbands, as you submit yourselves to the Lord.&#8221; Our biggest place of submission is to God. Then the other part to our husbands will fall more easily in place. Oh, what a responsible place wives fill! We are to be
a help meet (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+2%3A18">Genesis 2:18</a>),
a crown (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+12%3A4">Proverbs 12:4</a>),
and yet our biggest responsibility is to keep our own soul clear before God. He has given our souls to us and put it in our hands.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;He that keepeth the commandment <b>keepeth his own soul</b>.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+19%3A1" title="Proverbs 19:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 19:1)</span></a></span>
We shall each stand before God alone and give account for our own deeds. Our husbands will not stand in for us at the judgment.</p>


<p>My heart was saddened while talking to a young mother at a homeschool book fair. We had exchanged acquaintance and she was speaking of where they were currently attending church services. I asked her a question. She wasn&#8217;t sure about it, and so casually remarked, &#8220;The men will study it out.&#8221; How about this, sisters? Are we taking this attitude?
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Study to shew <i>thyself</i> approved unto God, a workman that needeth not be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A15" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 2:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 2:15)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>I clearly remember a message I heard shortly after my marriage. There was also another newly-married couple in the congregation. The pastor carried a burden for us. One Sunday morning the Lord led him to speak of wives not leaning on their husband&#8217;s experience, but to keep our own up-to-date with the Lord. He said, &#8220;Now you may have a good, saved husband, and it is right for him to be the head and leader of your home, but he can&#8217;t give you the grace and spiritual strength you need for the trials of life.&#8221; We can only look to God for the needed spiritual growth.</p>

<p>Some husbands are not living for the Lord. One scripture bears this out.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation [conduct] of the wives.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A1" title="I&nbsp;Peter 3:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 3:1)</span></a></span>
We are all individuals before God. The Lord will give light and understanding as we each open our hearts to His word. If our husband is not obeying the word in a given area and we do have light, how would we be a help meet to him if we do not stand true to the conviction God has given us? If we explain in meekness and humility and keep much in prayer, in time, the Lord will reveal to our husbands also. But I repeat, how important it is to hold it in meekness and humility and to keep bathed in prayer. You know, it is possible to be holding a right precept with a wrong attitude! Christ is our example.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+1%3A47" title="John 1:47"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 1:47)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Our family has just finished reading <a href="../../../texts/A_Religious_Controversy/index.html" title="A Religious Controversy">A Religious Controversy</a> together. It is a story of a husband and wife. They had each been church members for years. But, she became painfully aware of the lack of victory in her life. The Lord put conviction upon her heart, and God gave her a real experience of salvation at a revival meeting. She would come home and tell him about the message. Her husband would have none of it. But by her life and example, he too became convicted of his need of salvation. This sister had prayed for her husband and lived the verse in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A1">I&nbsp;Peter 3:1</a>.
It bore fruit and brought them into spiritual unity. How great was their happiness at this new oneness in Christ! This would have not been possible if she had not been true to light shone on her path.</p>

<p>The Lord is no respecter of persons of male or female. He wants a personal relationship with each of us. The Bible bears this out. There are times when the spirit of the Lord witnesses to both genders. Consider Mary and Joseph, Elizabeth and Zacharias. In the temple there was devoted Simon whom the Holy Ghost was upon and the prophetess Anna to whom God also revealed Himself. Consider the story of Manoah and his wife in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Judges+13">Judges 13</a>.
The angel of the Lord first appeared to Manoah&#8217;s wife and promised them a son. She told her husband; this brought him to prayer. He entreated the Lord to send the man of God again. God hearkened and the angel of God came again to the woman while she was alone in the field. She ran to get her husband and the angel of God spoke to both of them. Manoah&#8217;s heart was filled with thanksgiving and offered a sacrifice. When the flame went up toward heaven, the angel ascended in the flame. Manoah and his wife looked on and fell on their faces to the ground. Manoah became fearful and said,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;We shall surely die, because we have seen God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Judges+13%3A22" title="Judges 13:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Judges 13:22)</span></a></span>
Here at this time of fearfulness, Manoah&#8217;s wife was a crown and a true help meet to him. Her faith was not shaken and she replied,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;If the Lord were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would he at this time have told us such things as these.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Judges+13%3A23" title="Judges 13:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Judges 13:23)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>An older sister, a minister&#8217;s wife, has said that in times when she was feeling low and discouraged, her husband was a comfort and encouragement to her. Likewise, when he was going through trying times and needed encouragement, she was able to encourage him. Isn&#8217;t the Lord good? He will not give us more than we can bear, but will make a way of escape. The Lord designed us to be workers together. How sweet and precious is a union&#8212;one in flesh and also in spirit!</p>

<p>Oh, how we thank the Lord for His word and the understanding He gives. May we each one receive it with open hearts.</p>

<h1>&#8220;I Write Unto You, Young Men&#8221;</h1>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first"><span class="scripture">&#8220;I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+2%3A14" title="I&nbsp;John 2:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 2:14)</span></a></span></p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Young Men,</p>

<p>Brother John issues this as a statement, but it stands as an exhortation as well. If you are one of God&#8217;s saved children, this is the normal condition God has provided for you. It is not a statement of feeling, nor is it a statement that leaves nothing for you to do. To be strong, we must exercise our spiritual muscles. To have the Word of God abide in us; we must read and meditate over it and obey it until it does abide in us, and to overcome the wicked one, we must fight with God&#8217;s weapons until we do overcome. If you are not saved, this is part of God&#8217;s offer to you. Seek salvation.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+22%3A17" title="Revelation 22:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 22:17)</span></a></span>
God paid a great price to make salvation available to you, but your destiny is in your hands. I want to share a meditation along this line from Brother C. E. Orr:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Heaven gives out the announcement that as you spend your moments of life, so shall your eternity be. If you rightly improve the moments, you will be qualified for higher enjoyments and greater riches in eternity. All moments wasted have a woeful disqualifying effect. You shall give an account for every idle word and every wasted moment. The account you will have to render is that these idle words and wasted moments are disqualifying you for heavenly enjoyments. Every moment rightly improved is making you capable of higher felicity in heaven.</p>

<p>We see a mother coming with her boys, asking Jesus for a higher position for them in His heavenly kingdom. His reply to her is,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;[Such positions are] not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+20%3A23" title="Matthew 20:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 20:23)</span></a></span>
And for whom has the Father prepared such positions? They are prepared for all those who prepare for the position. There is a place close up at the right hand of Jesus for all those who will qualify for the place. How you spend life&#8217;s moments determines what positions you will occupy in glory. You will fit into the place for which you are fitted. Young people, you have this matter in your own hands. How you spend the moments of this day goes to determine what your position in that eternal world shall be. <b>Just one life lies before you, young man, young woman. You will pass over life&#8217;s pathway but once; yes, but once.</b> And every step you take never can be taken over. You do not have the privilege of trying it over again. If you make a misstep, the best it can do, and it should do this, is to help you to not make another one like it. It is true that Jesus can and will forgive us all our missteps, but the effect they leave upon our character will stand through all eternity. By the way you spend the moments of time today, you are adding to or diminishing your treasures in heaven. Your mansion in glory will be this evening according to how you spend the moments of the day. There is great responsibility in life. It means much to live. Thank God it is blessed when we hide our life with Christ in God and live in Him.</p>

<p>Young men, I beseech you, take hold of eternal life! The place of a child of God is a lowly place, and it is yet also an exalted place. We are nothing in ourselves, but we are vessels of precious and holy things.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+4%3A12" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 4:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 4:12)</span></a></span></p>

<hr class="minor" />
<div class="blurb"><p class="first">If the Lord opens the way, we hope to lay before you more thoughts in future issues on topics such as meditating on the scriptures, prayer, waiting on the Lord, and so on. We will certainly prayerfully consider any submissions along this line as well.</p>

<h1>Book Reviews</h1>

<p>The only safe criteria to use in evaluating a book is to carefully monitor the fruit that comes from the reading.</p>

<p>A godly pair of parents diligently read &#8220;good books&#8221; to their children. It was difficult to hold the interest of one of their boys. Finally a book was read that seemed to interest him and he asked for it over and over. It was read over and over. But then the father discerned something. He realized that the boy was fascinated by the accounts of sin related in the book. The book condemned those things and illustrated the folly of doing those things. But this boy wasn&#8217;t getting that. He was focused on the other and was ignoring the purpose of the narrative.</p>

<p>Not all of the books reviewed are deeply spiritual. Some are just good, healthy literature, generally suitable for family reading <b>with caution and prayerfulness</b>. Some must be handled with care. Some should not be handled at all, and this review will serve as a warning in such cases.</p>

<p class="author">Charles E. Orr</p>

<p>This is a book about prayer for those who actually pray. From the preface:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">It may be that some reader of this little book may question and even deny that man may have such a sweet and intimate communion with God as herein described. If so, I would ask him not to deny, but merely to say that he is not acquainted with such a life. There are those who thus walk with God. This little treatise does not lift up an ideal life of prayer too high to be attained, but describes real facts as far as it lies in the ability of the author&#8217;s pen to describe them.</p>

<p>I would ask the reader to read slowly and thoughtfully. Especially would I have him meditate upon the quotations on the closing pages.</p>

<p>It was not at all my intention to make this a thorough work on prayer. It is intended to be a book that you may pick up and peruse now and then, when you become dull and do not have as much appetite for prayer as you desire. My hope is that this little volume will prove an encouragement to all its readers and a stimulus to increase their relish for communion with God.</p>

<h1>&#8220;&#8230;&#8203;To Love Your Children&#8221;: Journal Writing</h1>

<p>We all, as mothers, desire to have a close relationship with our children. Often that dream is hindered. There are many reasons for this, whether personal internal struggles or outward rebellion. As parents, it is hard for us to see things as they are, but God knows, and He is able to give us the wisdom that we need.</p>

<p>One area that has been a challenge to me is the ability to communicate with my children. As the years have gone by and they enter their adolescence, this area is particularly threatened as it is a time when one is changing so much and feelings of turmoil are often felt. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I have heard more than once, &#8220;Oh, but you don&#8217;t understand.&#8221; These are often frustrating moments for those involved. In my home, I discovered that writing is often a better way of communicating, as it gives some time for the recipient to ponder over what is trying to be said, instead of just assuming things, as so often happens when we try to communicate in person. Don&#8217;t feel discouraged if you aren&#8217;t an excellent writer. Writing is not one of my talents, but the Lord has helped me to write at the time it is needed. He can help you, too.</p>

<p>I can pull out of my own experience the wonderful effect that a letter can have. At one time in my early adult life I wrote to my father, as I hadn&#8217;t felt unconditionally loved and was terribly afraid to even see him. I took the time to write this down in love (as I truly loved him and couldn&#8217;t face the rejection that I &#8220;felt&#8221; so keenly) and sent the letter to him. No sooner had he read my letter and understood its meaning than he called me up and apologized for the pain he had caused and said that he would not continue in the manner that he had done. Oh, how this response touched my heart and I was again free in my soul!</p>

<p>None of us are perfect, and we need encouragement to press on to the &#8220;mark of our high calling.&#8221; As parents, we should encourage our children in love. We have need to rebuke and correct, but we need the Lord&#8217;s help to see and endorse their good qualities and/or spiritual growth. There is always something that is good in everyone, and God can show us if we&#8217;ll let Him.</p>

<p>With all this in mind, I found that perhaps our family could take on the habit of writing to one another. I purchased a journal for each of the children, with hope that it would be used to communicate with each one on a regular basis. The older girls also purchased some journals and began writing letters of encouragement to each other. Things did not go as smoothly as I would have liked, as habits and trust do not grow over night. It was not easy to take the time to write, and it was particularly hard when there was no response on the other side. Nevertheless, I found the journals a very helpful way of being able to express my appreciation and love to each child, as so often they only hear the correction and are oblivious to words of encouragement. I wrote quite frequently at first, as it was greatly needed at the time. As time has gone by, I write when I know it is needed, and the Lord helps me out to do so. In time, the girls&#8217; relationships were growing stronger, and my relationship with them was growing as well. If we look at things day by day, we can become discouraged&#8212;we need to look at the overall effect, realizing that there will be times when it seems things are regressing. That is the reality of life in general, is it not? Yet, we can trust that God is working out His purposes in us.</p>

<p>It has been nearly two years since we starting writing in these journals. I am so thankful for the Lord helping me to take time in this way to express my love to each of my children. I have only one son, and my entries in his journal have been few, and it may be that one book will suffice until he leaves home. He hadn&#8217;t been interested in such an endeavor, but I did want to do my part anyway. One time I realized that it had been some time since I had written to him. When I had finally gotten around to writing in his book, I had discovered to my horror that it had been nearly a year since my last entry. I wrote an apology for my neglect and then continued to write. My last writing was just recently, and to my absolute shock and wonderful surprise as I was putting the book away I noticed some writing. He had never responded before, and here is what he wrote: &#8220;Thank you, Mom, for the letter. With lots of love, &#8212;&#8212;&#8221; This is one who feels that the fewer words used in communicating, the better! Like you may suppose, I was thrilled to have received such a precious response.</p>

<p>By no means is this the only way that I show my love to my children. It is in my actions and words of each day that I trust God to help me to be a beacon of God&#8217;s love in our home, but I do believe that the written word is something that one can go back to and reflect on. During these two years we all have grown a great deal as we have had many trials, but with each trial God has given us the victory. Praise His name for His faithfulness to us!</p>

It sounds kind of like the ending of a message, but I want to follow this phrase and this thought. Essentially we&#8217;re looking at Brother Paul&#8217;s concluding remarks in his letter to the Romans, and I find this thought carried through his other letters:</p>

<p>I feel like I have just been blessed. I want to think about just what is behind this benediction, or this greeting:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.&#8221;</span>
It has enough value and enough substance that it was the way Brother Paul essentially concluded every one of his letters.</p>

<p>I looked up the word <i>grace</i> in this context. The word in this context means &#8220;the divine influence upon the heart and its reflection in the life.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Divine influence upon the heart and its reflection in the life. Think about that. I started thinking about the things that Brother Paul had been writing in these letters. There is a lot of instruction, sometimes quite a bit of correction, sometimes exhortation, sometimes just laying a solid groundwork of understanding. And concluding each letter, this thought concerning what we need for all of this: &#8220;the Divine influence upon the heart.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t mean much to know good things, to know true things, to believe them, to even want to follow them, unless we have the Divine influence on our heart.</p>

<p>I want to think a little bit more about what influence is. When we go different places, sometimes we notice this more than others. Some folks I work with do quite a bit of traveling, and one of them in particular was prone to pick up quite a bit of sayings and mannerisms of speaking from wherever she would travel. One time she had gone on a trip to England, and she started using quite a bit more British-sounding words for awhile. Another time she had gone back to Virginia and came back using a &#8220;Virginia accent&#8221;&#8212;it seemed sort of like a mixture of British and Southern. She would pick up other things from other places she had gone. She&#8217;d been to Florida and came back saying &#8220;y&#8217;all.&#8221; There was a certain susceptibility to the particular influence of how people spoke around her. You can look at another aspect of influence: when a little child has been around a lot of other little children, they seem to get excited after awhile&#8212;stirred up&#8212;maybe kind of wild. When they&#8217;ve been around a number of adults, that exerts a different kind of influence. You can look into your own life and see, when you have been around certain people, it has a certain influence on you. When you&#8217;ve spent time with a particular friend, sometimes people can see the influence. When you&#8217;ve been reading certain things, sometimes it carries an influence. When you&#8217;ve been singing, or listening to certain things, it carries an influence. And when you&#8217;ve been spending time with Jesus, it carries an influence.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Divine <i>influence</i> of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.&#8221; Think about that. To live godly we need the Divine influence. We need to spend the time with Jesus to have that influence in us. We need to allow that influence to have its work. We are always spending time with people and around different influences. We have some control over those kind of things, and we are called to exercise control to withdraw from evil influences and draw near to good ones. And within our control we can do a fair amount of that, though we&#8217;re not entirely able to avoid those things that aren&#8217;t a good influence. But even aside from physically being around those things, we can have attitudes of heart that help us. When we open ourselves to certain influences&#8212;we think, &#8220;I like this; this sounds good&#8221;&#8212;we open ourselves to it. Or maybe, &#8220;This doesn&#8217;t seem right,&#8221; and we shut ourselves up to it. I drive home from work along different routes. Sometimes I drive home on a route that has many billboards and signs along the road, and I have to close myself to many of those influences. On the other hand, there are other things I can see on the way home that are uplifting and have a positive influence. It may be the beauties of God&#8217;s creation, and occasionally, a billboard or sign. But the best influence of all is that influence of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>In a devotional I was reading, a brother was talking about a person living that more abundant life. They lived close enough to the Lord so that each thing they saw tended to be translated into a spiritual influence. For example, if they saw someone driving in an expensive and elegant car, they thought, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be riding home in a glorious chariot to heaven someday.&#8221; If they saw somebody dressed up, looking very fine and good, they thought, &#8220;I want to have the precious robes of righteousness in my life.&#8221; There is a tendency and an ability that we can grow in, with the Lord&#8217;s help, to have things come to us through the influence of Jesus Christ. But beyond that, no amount of our own training is going to be enough. We need that direct influence of Jesus on us. I know when it&#8217;s strong and when it&#8217;s weak. I know when trials come, if there is a lot of the Divine influence, the trial gets smaller. Or somehow, by comparison, the power working in me is much larger. And when the trial gets larger, I need to go seek more of that Divine influence.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.&#8221;</span>
</p>

<p>The other part of the definition of <i>grace</i> is &#8220;its reflection in the life.&#8221; When we say of someone, &#8220;God&#8217;s grace is upon them,&#8221; we&#8217;re seeing a reflection of the Divine influence. A reflection can come as a person yields themselves to the Divine influence. As time goes on, as God is working in our lives, the reflection gets better. There is less of us getting in the way, more of the Lord. It&#8217;s a precious thing, first of all, to get the Divine influence in our lives. And it&#8217;s still more precious, as that influence works in us, that more and more things that would hinder the reflection get removed out of our lives. I have habits, quirks of personality&#8212;personality traits maybe&#8212;various things that tend to block the reflection. I want the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ to be with me. I want it to be working in me. I need first of all to have the influence in my heart, then I want it to keep working, powerfully, until the reflection begins to get clearer. I want taken out of me those things that hinder that reflection. I want to be a blessing to others.</p>

<p>I remember a story of how one sister was working by the bedside of someone who was very sick. It was the burden of her heart that somehow God would reach this person. She had been just letting the Divine influence work in her, and finally she was stirred to speak, saying, &#8220;Do you ever have thoughts of God?&#8221; And the person responded, &#8220;How can I help but have thoughts of God, since you have been around?&#8221; That&#8217;s quite a testimony. I would like to have that testimony, not out of a sense of envy, or out of wanting it to be said of me in a Sunday School lesson. I just want the Divine influence, to help other people be drawn to God.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you <i>all</i>.&#8221;</span>
Brother Paul desired that for each one to whom he was writing; not just the ministers, the pillars, the elders, or those that had been established a long time in the faith, but everyone who was listening, everyone who was receiving the letter. Another place he said,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;grace be with <b>all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity</b>.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+6%3A24" title="Ephesians 6:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 6:24)</span></a></span>
To have the grace of our Lord working in us, we just need that desire and honesty in our hearts&#8212;&#8220;Lord, I don&#8217;t just want all this for some kind of outward impression. I just really need Your grace, I need what You&#8217;ve got. I need that Divine influence. That precious influence.&#8221;</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The grace of <b>our Lord Jesus Christ</b>.&#8221;</span>
I think about how it came to us. Of our <i>Lord</i> Jesus Christ: our Lord, our Master, the One who has the right to be influencing us. Our Lord <i>Jesus</i>: the Man who lived down here, His purpose to save His people from their sins. Our Lord Jesus <i>Christ</i>: the Messiah, the Deliverer, the Son of God. By His <i>example</i> we can receive His influence. By drawing near to Him, as a child to a parent, as a servant to a master, we can have that influence. By submitting to Him, as Lord and Master, we can allow that influence.</p>

<p>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</p>

<h1>We Trusted in God: Part 3</h1>

<p>At this point, I feel constrained to relate an incident in my life of which I am ashamed. A minister came to me and admonished me to be careful about a certain young sister&#8217;s feelings. She admired me because of how the Lord had been using me as a minister, and the admonishing brother stated that she was vulnerable emotionally and warned me to be careful. My idea of carefulness was not his, as I was very naive about human nature in general and these matters in particular, so I did not do well at all. I thought that telling her how I felt and making plain my intention of only being a platonic friend would suffice to alleviate any harm. I was wrong; my unwise attention to her left the wrong impression and caused her to hope that something would work out or was working out. When it became evident that I really regarded her simply as a Christian sister only, she felt betrayed and hurt. I saw that I was wrong to have paid any attention to her at all. It was not my intention at all to trifle with this sister&#8217;s affections, <b>but it had that effect anyway</b>.</p>

<p>Slowly and painfully, I began to realize the nature of the emotional relations between men and women. Here is where I would have profited a great deal from my folks&#8217; oversight. It would have saved me from many unwise actions which originated from the naivete of my youth. The Lord was teaching me of the appropriateness of a vast reserve toward the opposite gender, the meaning of Godly discretion. I was inclined to be too free and familiar by nature&#8212;such was the way that I naturally interpreted
<span class="scripture">&#8220;[treat] the younger [women] as sisters, with all purity.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+5%3A2" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 5:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 5:2)</span></a></span>
I teased my sister in fun; I spent time with her, so I mistakenly thought I could carry on this sort of friendship with sisters in the Lord. I was greatly in error, as I did not properly understand the nature of what I was dealing with. I meant well, but it did not (and could not) turn out well.</p>

<p>Young sisters with discretion (or discerning parents) simply withdrew, and I was on the start of a path that would have made of me a young man without discretion. But here the Lord helped me, for I really wanted to do what was right and was praying and seeking God when things did not turn out well. Looking back, I can see that if I hadn&#8217;t had this desire to please God, I might have become interested in less spiritual young women or even unspiritual ones. The Lord taught me how to behave, little by little, but the indiscretion did some damage to my reputation. There were those who understood, and there were those who did not.</p>

<p>I was about nineteen years of age at that time, and my thoughts and expectations about marriage were largely formed by my conditioning. I esteemed my parents highly and felt that their relationship was an example to follow. They did have a good marriage and got along well. We children were presented with a united front from my parents in our upbringing. They held together before us godly values. As a parent now, I appreciate all the more what it takes to achieve what they did.</p>

<p>Years of single bachelorhood followed these experiences. I traveled here and there in the work of the Lord. At times the loneliness seemed unbearable. One night, in prayer, I cried out to God in agony. &#8220;Lord,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I love children. I want to be a father. Is this all just to be wasted?&#8221; The tears fell, and my heart ached. All of my efforts to follow God in seeking a companion seemed to be wasted&#8212;I had no companion. As with David, it seemed,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+73%3A1" title="Psalm 73:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 73:1)</span></a></span>
There was One who saw and heard it all.</p>

<p>I began to despair, and backslid. I went into sin and did not live for God for about a month. The devil tried to entangle me, but the Lord had mercy on me. The fear of God was still on me and caused me to
frame my doings (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hosea+5%3A4">Hosea 5:4</a>).
At this point, I started over and sought the Lord for forgiveness. He most graciously forgave and cleansed me. I moved back to a congregation in Oklahoma. Here I was rebaptised and sought the Lord again for the infilling of His Holy Spirit. I consecrated to be all His again, as I had been before. Because I had backslidden, I thought that it was less likely than ever that a spiritual young woman would be interested in me. I asked the Lord for grace to live alone. I was twenty-four years old.</p>

<p>My pastor (a godly man) took up the prayer burden. He and his wife began to intercede with God for me. A certain sister&#8217;s name came to mind while I was in prayer. I was afraid of it. I was afraid that if it didn&#8217;t turn out that God was in it that I couldn&#8217;t deal with it. I was afraid of going through a trial like the other one had been. I told the Lord all about it. I told my pastor and his wife, too. They encouraged me to look to God.</p>

<p>The Lord helped me. I resolved to attend a young people&#8217;s meeting about an hour away from where I lived where I knew she regularly attended. I determined to wait until I saw some evidence of God working on her end before I said or did anything other than attend this meeting.</p>

<p>I had learned by this time that when God was in a matter, He would work on both ends, not just one. In
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+32%3A6-8">Jeremiah 32:6-8</a>,
the story is related of how the prophet Jeremiah felt that the Lord wanted him to buy property in Judah, <b>although he had been prophesying that the Chaldeans would take the people into Babylon and possess the land.</b> After Jeremiah had this impression, things actually began to work out&#8212;Hanameel the son of Shallum came unto him in the very court of the prison, requesting him to buy his field. Whereupon Jeremiah said,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;<i>Then</i> I knew that this was the word of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+32%3A8" title="Jeremiah 32:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jeremiah 32:8)</span></a></span>
Upon this evidence that God was working on both ends, Jeremiah
<span class="scripture">&#8220;weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver. And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances. So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+32%3A9-11" title="Jeremiah 32:9-11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jeremiah 32:9-11)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days. For thus saith the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+32%3A14-15" title="Jeremiah 32:14-15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jeremiah 32:14-15)</span></a></span>
He entered fully and completely into the transaction when he was assured that God was in the matter.</p>

<p>I went for a number of months to this young people&#8217;s meeting&#8212;each week, if I remember correctly. I paid no special attention to the sister or spoke to her other than normal courtesy. Nothing happened that indicated that God was in the matter on her end that I could see. Finally, I told the Lord that as nothing was happening, maybe I had better quit going. Then I felt that I should ask her out to eat and talk, to see if God was in the matter. Take the search for God&#8217;s working on her end to another level, so to speak, to see if it should be pursued. I felt a blessing in this; also, I renewed my consecration to break off all contact if no evidence of God&#8217;s hand should surface.</p>

<p>Before I saw her again, I managed to break my leg. So the next time I went to that young people&#8217;s meeting, I was on crutches with a cast. I found out that I couldn&#8217;t carry my Bible and hop around on crutches as well, so a friend of mine carried my Bible in for me. Several offered to carry it out for me at the end of the service, too, but I pointed to Elois, who was talking with a brother&#8217;s wife, and stated, that if she didn&#8217;t mind, she could carry it out for me. She indicated that she would be glad to do so. At my car, when she handed me my Bible, I asked her if I could take her out to eat at a certain day the next week. She readily consented, but I still could not tell if God was in it or not.</p>

<p>I was looking forward to sharing an evening and a pleasant meal with a sister in Christ who I highly respected and appreciated. I had known her since I was about fourteen or fifteen and felt definitely that she dearly loved the Lord and was living for Him by His help. I felt certain that her eyes were on the Lord and she would not pursue anything like this unless she felt God was in it. As to whether the Lord was in the matter or not, I was confident that God would cause it to come out right. If He did not, without any further ado, I intended to break off all contact and have nothing to do with the matter. I was not at all interested in anything that did not clearly and plainly have God&#8217;s approval and blessing upon it in unmistakable terms.</p>

<p>Now I am forty-four years old and am relating events of about twenty years ago. And in this narrative, I am now facing the age-old question back over the years. That question, of course, is, &#8220;How do I know who is the right one?&#8221; And I will tell you&#8212;at that point I didn&#8217;t know. I was trusting Him who did know to guide me aright. I had told Him in prayer that I had realized that I didn&#8217;t have the knowledge or insight necessary to choose the right companion. I didn&#8217;t have it then, and the Lord helped me to realize that both she and I would change as we grew older. I was much impressed with my lack of ability to properly evaluate (1) our current compatibility, and (2) our future compatibility. It was one of the wisest things I have ever done (and I did it by the Lord&#8217;s help)&#8212;to confess my lack of wisdom.</p>

<p>I pause here a minute to reflect and contrast this way of proceeding with the way of the world. My mother and father dated to gain familiarity with the other gender, to learn to know themselves, to develop skill and understanding in dealing with others, etc. To a certain extent, it worked. But it left its scars, its sad stories. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to hurt him.&#8221; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to lead her on.&#8221; They felt more competent as they gained more wisdom; I felt more at peace in Jesus as I saw and confessed my great need of help and trusted Him. The first way is your search for what you think is best, with
the prayer that God would bless your Ishmael (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+17%3A18">Genesis 17:18</a>),
while the other way is completely and wholeheartedly that God may have His way. How weighty are the words of the Proverbist,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Trust in the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, and depart from evil.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+3%3A5-7" title="Proverbs 3:5-7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 3:5-7)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>We would now like to quote a little from <i>The Christian&#8217;s Secret of a Happy Life</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">We come now to the question as to how God&#8217;s guidance is to come to us, and how we shall be able to know His voice.</p>

<p>There are four especial ways in which God speaks: by the voice of Scripture, the voice of the inward impressions of the Holy Spirit, the voice of our own higher judgment, and the voice of providential circumstances.</p>

<p>Where these four harmonize, it is safe to say that God speaks. For I lay it down as a foundation principle, which no one can gainsay, that of course His voice will always be in harmony with Itself, no matter in how many different ways He may speak. The voices may be many, the message can be but one. If God tells me in one voice to do or to leave undone anything, He cannot possibly tell me the opposite in another voice. If there is a contradiction in the voices, the speaker cannot be the same. Therefore, my rule for distinguishing the voice of God would be to bring it to the test of this harmony.</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[Smith, Hannah W.; <a href="../../../texts/The_Christians_Secret_of_a_Happy_Life/index.html"><i>The Christian&#8217;s Secret of a Happy Life</i></a>, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/The_Christians_Secret_of_a_Happy_Life/Difficulties_Concerning_Guidance/index.html">Difficulties Concerning Guidance</a>&#8221;]</span></p>

<p>It was the harmony of everything that began to establish my belief that God was actually in this matter with this dear sister. Perhaps you are acquainted with some individuals, zealous and consecrated, who have made a horrible mistake in this matter of Divine leadership in marriage. They thought they were marrying in the order of the Lord, but it turned out to be a tragic mistake.</p>

<p>It is a serious and solemn thought: <b>if the devil cannot get us to abandon the right path for the ways of sin and self-will, then he will try to push us too far into an unreasonable and fanatical way that will damage us just as much.</b> The Lord is just as faithful to keep us from one error as from the other if we will consecrate our lives to Him and follow only the sound of His voice.</p>

<p>Surely you can see, dear reader, the awful advantage which Satan gains over two souls (and those who are added to the couple) if he is successful in causing us to listen to other voices than the still quiet voice of the Holy Spirit. This decision is one of the most critical that you will ever make, ranking just behind your decision to live for God at all. So great is the influence on our own soul&#8217;s welfare of the one that we marry, that it is almost true that in choosing our life companion, we are almost choosing heaven or hell.</p>

<p>There are certain critical, vital things which are necessary for a sound, healthy marriage to work as the Master Designer intended. If these things are missing, <i>run</i>! Leave it alone! Give the entire matter to God and flee!</p>

<p>There must be a strong natural affinity between the two who are intending to be man and wife. The presence of natural affinity is too often taken as conclusive and that is not sound, <b>but it is important that it be there</b>. What a mistake to marry someone to whom you are not attracted! Someone with whom you realize no natural affinity! Marriage is both spirit and flesh. Consider
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+7%3A5">I&nbsp;Corinthians 7:5</a>.
</p>

<p>It is important to fall in love <b>after you know that God is in the matter of a truth. Then and only then is it safe to fall in love.</b> One minister said that marriage should be a life-long love affair that never stops until death. No one should ever marry anyone <b>unless they really love him/her</b>. You are going to need it. You cannot get along without it. <b>You had better really be sure that you really love him/her, and that he/she really loves you.</b></p>

<p>Wait on God until you know. Tarry until you are absolutely certain.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;They that wait upon the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+40%3A3" title="Isaiah 40:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 40:3)</span></a></span>
Do not presume; do not run ahead of the Lord.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Wait on the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+27%3A14" title="Psalm 27:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 27:14)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Well, after I had waited and was sure, did it work? Did I fall in love with Elois? You better believe it! Ask anybody who was around and knew us. I fell head-over-heels, absolutely crazy over her. One of our friends said of me, &#8220;It&#8217;s good to see that you have got it as badly as she does.&#8221; And, twenty years later, I&#8217;m still crazy about her. By the help of the Lord, I expect to be madly in love with this wonderful wife of mine right up to the end of our lives.</p>

<p>I am in love <b>because I set my will to love her</b>. Sometimes I <i>feel</i> more loving than other times, but I <i>am</i> in love with my wife all the time. The feelings, more or less, come and go, rise and fall; but the consecration of my heart and the dedication of my life to my darling are continual and constant.</p>

<p>But wait a minute! How was I sure that this one was the person to love? The one and only? The workings of the Lord began to unfold&#8212;to reveal themselves.</p>

<p>He <i>had</i> been dealing with her. I do not think that she would have gone with me to eat out if she had not felt that this was opening up for her from the Lord. Long afterwards, she told me that she was thinking as I asked her out, &#8220;It&#8217;s really happening.&#8221; Behind that lay dreams; dreams which disturbed her and led her to consecrate herself lest she be led only by desires for a companion and not by the Lord. I do not want to tell all of my wife&#8217;s story (although it is very sacred to me), for I think it best that you hear it from her.</p>

<p>The time was ripe. God always moves when the time is right. The ripeness of our lives for this step was shown in a thousand ways, but when I think upon this, I feel strongly led to emphasize <b>complete dependence upon God</b> above anything else. Dear reader, there is not a magic formula, a perfect checklist. God did not intend for you to know ahead of time how it works altogether, yet He did intend for you to have a full assurance when the hour is come. Quiet yourself. Submit your natural desires for a companion and home to Him who knows and understands all things. Humble yourself before God and pray for more perfect love and dedication to Him. Pray to die to all but Him that you may truly live. Trust Him with it all when all seems dark ahead.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;As it written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+2%3A9-10" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 2:9-10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 2:9-10)</span></a></span>
Trust Him that it will be revealed.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ruth+2%3A12" title="Ruth 2:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ruth 2:12)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Do you think that the Lord will let you down and fail to bring good things to you?
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Like as a father pitieth his children, so the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> pitieth them that fear him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+103%3A1" title="Psalm 103:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 103:1)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;Commit thy way unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+37%3A5" title="Psalm 37:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 37:5)</span></a></span>
These words were written by one who learned much of the great value of waiting on God. The Almighty Himself encourages you to trust Him with your life and for all things.</p>

<p>The unfolding of the precious will of God was wonderful. Mingled with all the joy of special love for the one special individual was a supreme love for God and His ways, and a clear definite knowledge that we were doing as He would have us do. All was on the altar of perfect consecration, and the steady ripening of our love for each other was sanctified by the Master&#8217;s will. What a beautiful time of exploration and adjustment! Our time together was very precious; our conversations hallowed. Very little hint of the adjustments ahead were visible to our enraptured eyes at that time. But He whom we trusted was preparing us for those times ahead just as surely as He had prepared us for the time at hand.</p>

<p>As Elois and I began to spend time together, we were much impressed with how easily and naturally we fitted together. We found that we shared many common interests in everyday life as well as spiritual values. It was a joy to talk, to open ourselves to each other. We were innocent of the understanding that we also possessed many different tastes, habits, and ways. The discovery of how much we had in common completely eclipsed how much we did not. This, of course, is classic. The path to maturity must begin with immaturity.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Trouble in the flesh&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+7%3A28" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 7:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 7:28)</span></a></span> seemed far away.
</p>

<p>At this point, in discussing the joy and sense of completeness that comes with finding your companion, I reflect on the universality of this experience. People who do not even love the Lord or know Him fall in love with each other. People from arranged marriages, wherein they were promised to each other as little children, may fall in love. Loveless marriages (what a sad spectacle) may change into a relationship where husband and wife fall in love. People fall in love who have no right to do so. This experience of romantic love, which can bring one of the most wonderful joys that one can know, can be imitated by an unlawful, illegitimate substitution which deceptively mimics the genuine. My mind goes back to a minister of God who was preaching on this subject. He stated, &#8220;God has put an attraction between the man and woman.&#8221; He paused, then added, &#8220;It is good that it is so.&#8221; In spite of how it is abused, it still functions wonderfully in the realm where God intended it to. Unselfish affection even has a certain uplifting characteristic among those who have sunk far down in degradation.</p>

<p>Consider for a moment the great plan of the Master. He could have devised a way for children to come into the world without parents, without families. He could have made us so that we are left in eggs in the sand as turtles do. No real affection develops between the Mama turtle and the youngsters. No affectionate family ties between Daddy and Mama turtle. If you think this is a strange thought, I beg of you to look around. Is it not true that many young people try to act as though they just appeared on the scene somehow, as though they had no Mama or Daddy, no parents?</p>

<p>God has designed us differently, has He not? There is a potential in us that is not in other parts of His creation. Many have concluded that the feelings of love, openness, etc. are not designed to last. That might suffice, they would say, for the time of youth, etc., but it can&#8217;t stay like that. Men are men; women are women. They actually prove to have little in common, etc&#8230;. No doubt you recognize the philosophy. It is the way of bitterness, of disappointment, of remorse, of failure. Its close cousin would have us believe that lasting happiness, etc., is for the fortunate few&#8212;&#8220;Just lucky, I guess.&#8221; Some people have found so little good in the human experience that they are actually envious of turtles, sad to say.</p>

<p>God did not mean it to be this way for people.
He designed marriage to be <span class="scripture">&#8220;<i>honourable</i> in all.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+13%3A4" title="Hebrews 13:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 13:4)</span></a></span>
He personally married the first couple. If a man and woman go about it as they should, God&#8217;s plan offers enormous benefits to the couple, together and individually, and to everyone else. We all benefit from the effects of strong, healthy marriages and wise parenting. We all suffer from the effects of weak marriages and foolish oversight.</p>

<h1>With Love, from the Editress</h1>

<p class="noindent">My dear Sisters,</p>

<p>I feel that God wants me to use this space in this issue to reprint a portion of <i>The Hidden Life</i>. I trust it is blessing to you and that we will all take to heart the truth that is in these words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">How delightful to walk with those whom we love! How blessed is the companionship of true and faithful friends! As our hearts commune together, we grow deeper into each other&#8217;s love. The husband and wife grow so deeply into each other&#8217;s affections that they seem to live in each other. They are of one heart and soul and life, and so much like each other are they that to meet one is to meet both. God is man&#8217;s true friend. Never was there a love for man like God&#8217;s love. Oh! the wide, deep, and infathomable love of God. It encircles the universe. It reaches to the most insignificant of his creatures. You may have other friends of His creatures. You may have other friends and those who love you, but He is the truest friend, and no love is as His love. How sweet must it be to walk with Him! How blessed must be the companionship of such a true and faithful friend! How glorious to commune with Him as heart talks to heart and to feel oneself growing deeper in His love! To live in Him and to have our being in Him and to have Him dwell in us is to have heaven in us and to be in heaven.</p>

<p>In giving the biography of some men, whole volumes have been written. The three-hundred-years&#8217; history of one man is told in these few words: <span class="scripture">&#8220;[He] walked with God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+5%3A24" title="Genesis 5:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 5:24)</span></a></span> Men have conquered nations, discovered continents, built cities, founded empires; and volumes are required to tell of all they have done. But Enoch did more&#8212;he <span class="scripture">&#8220;walked with God.&#8221;</span> What a history! Whole volumes have said less than this.</p>

<p>But this privilege did not belong to Enoch alone; it is yours, reader, and it is mine. We have the blessed privilege of engraving this epitaph upon the hearts and the minds of men: &#8220;He walked with God.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is not said that God walked with Enoch, but that Enoch walked with God. Some heart might sighingly say, &#8220;Oh, that God would walk with me!&#8221; Let the sighings of thy heart be changed to saying, &#8220;Oh, let me walk with God!&#8221; There are many who would be pleased to have God walk with <i>them</i>, but who will not walk with <i>Him</i>. God&#8217;s course was marked out before man was created. From this course He never turns. If you desire His companionship, you must walk in His way. Some seek the honor of walking with men of renown, but no higher honor can be given man than the privilege of walking with God. Others may delight to sit in the court of kings and desire to walk in the way with lords and noblemen; but my heart craves naught else than a walk with God.</p>

<p>God will condescend to walk with those who walk with Him; but if you would walk with Him, you must go in the ways in which He leads. Suppose you and another man took a ride through the country. He owned the horse and carriage, and did the driving. He went the way he desired. You went along for the sake of companionship. You do not say that the man rode with you, but that you rode with him. When you see a little child walking by the side of its father with its hand in his, you say that the child is walking with its father. It goes where its father leads. But you could not say that the child was walking with the father if the father was being led aside by the child in its chase after the gay butterfly. To walk with the Lord, you must put your hand in His and go where He leads.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;But take diligent heed&#8230;&#8203;to love the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> your God and to walk in <i>all</i> his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and all your soul.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Joshua+22%3A5" title="Joshua 22:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Joshua 22:5)</span></a></span> You will not fail to notice, I trust, that you are here commanded to be diligent to walk in <i>all His ways</i>. The ways in which you are to walk, if you walk with God, are all to be His ways. None are to be yours. Let me here speak to you very feelingly. The simple reason why you do not have a satisfactory walk with God is because you have not left all your own ways. Here is a very precious secret not found by everyone. You would walk with God in a great many of His ways and would leave many of your ways; but there is one little way you are loath to leave. Whenever the way of God begins to lead you from that way, you feel a little uneasy and almost ready to murmur. You have had many pleasant hours along that way of yours. The lust of the eye has been so often gratified there that, indeed, it seems like plucking out the eye to leave that way. Oh, how difficult to turn away from it! So many fond recollections are clustering along that way. Some dear friend is walking there, with whom you are loath to part company. It may be a father or a mother, a husband or a wife, or children. It may be houses or lands. But all these must be forsaken to walk with Jesus.</p>

<p>One young man asked, &#8220;Must I forsake my mother to walk with God?&#8221;</p>

<p>The reply was, &#8220;Yes, you must forsake your mother&#8212;you must forsake all.&#8221;</p>

<p>But here is the explanation: this is not meant in the literal sense. You need not leave her home, but you cannot walk in her ways if she walks in sin. If she will forsake her ways to walk in God&#8217;s ways then you and she will walk in the same way; but you cannot walk in the Spirit with anyone who does not walk with God. When their associations would interfere with your walk with God, you must forsake even that. To walk with Jesus means for you to forsake everything that would hinder your walk with Him. Herein lies the precious secret of a safe, prosperous, and happy Christian life.</p>

<p>A walk with God is a satisfactory walk. He who walks with God is delighted all the way. Alas! many who are hoping that they are Christians and that they will reach the fair climes of heaven and there delight themselves in God are quite dissatisfied with their walk here. A dissatisfied walk on earth never ends in heaven. Wherever God is, there is heaven, and wherever heaven is, there the soul is satisfied; consequently, to walk with God satisfies the soul. It is only when man chooses his own way and walks apart from God that life becomes dissatisfactory. Those who choose their own way will meet with disappointment and with difficulties that they will not be able to overcome. In God&#8217;s ways there are no disappointments. When our wills are submitted to Him and we humbly and submissively walk where He leads us, we meet with no disappointments.</p>

<p>A trusting saint said in a recent conversation: &#8220;I can be satisfied only when I know I am in the way with Jesus; only when I know my hand is in His and He is leading me. I would not take one little way without Him. One step without His leading may be fatal. I can walk through darkness in safety when He leads. I would rather walk through the furnace flame with Jesus than through the fields of roses without Him. Amid the flowers there may be a thorn to prick me, but the furnace flame cannot kindle upon me when Christ is by my side.&#8221;</p>

<p>As remarked before, to walk with God one must follow where He leads. The command is, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Be ye&#8230;&#8203;followers of God as dear children.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A1" title="Ephesians 5:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 5:1)</span></a></span> A friend remarked, &#8220;Oh! if I only knew where He would lead me, or if I could only see to the end of the way.&#8221; Thou foolish child! Such a faint heart cannot walk with God.</p>

<p>One night during a very heavy rain a father and child were compelled to walk a mile to a neighbor&#8217;s through water up to the child&#8217;s waist. When their wet clothes were exchanged for dry, the neighbor said to the boy, &#8220;Were you not much afraid while walking through the deep water?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;Papa was with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though our walk with God may lead us through deep water, we need not fear; for God hath said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;they shall not overflow thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;q=they shall not overflow thee " title=""><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> ()</span></a></span></p>

<p>A vessel at one time was in an angry storm at sea. Among the many passengers on board was a skeptic, a Christian lady, and her little boy. During the storm the skeptic was in great alarm, but he could not help noticing the calmness and restfulness of the lady and her boy. After the storm was over, he talked with the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;My child,&#8221; he began, &#8220;were you not afraid during the storm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; replied the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;And why were you not afraid?&#8221; inquired the skeptic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because my mama was with me,&#8221; answered the lad.</p>

<p>Turning to the mother, the skeptic said, &#8220;Lady, were you not afraid during such a storm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; replied the woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;And why were you not afraid?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said she, &#8220;my Father was with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sometimes the way in which God leads you may be through the storm and through the dark, but you need not fear nor falter. Only listen, and you will hear Him saying, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Fear thou not; for I am with thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+41%3A10" title="Isaiah 41:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 41:10)</span></a></span> He may lead you over some stony places, but He is only bringing you to the green pastures and the still waters just beyond. He may need to lead you close by a dark and dangerous precipice in order to bring you into the land of flowers in the valley. One time there was something I very greatly desired. I sought for a time, at the advice of my friends to seek for it in <i>my</i> way, but I found it not. At that time I felt the Lord calling me in a way I had not walked before. The way led through some privation and suffering, and it seemed to lead directly away from that which I had been seeking. Nevertheless I decided to follow where Jesus led me, be that where it might. After I had passed through some suffering and tests, behold, He brought me to the very thing I was desiring. Blessed be His name!</p>

<p>Jesus knows best. If you could see down your future way, your eye would rest only upon the dangerous precipice or on the stony place, and you would fail to see the green pastures, the still waters, and the flowery fields lying beyond.</p>

<p>Abraham started with his only son, Isaac, whom he loved, to go into the land of Moriah, there to offer him upon one of the mountains as a burnt offering. The journey required three days. As they walked on their way, the happy, innocent boy said to Abraham, <span class="scripture">&#8220;My father&#8230;&#8203;Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+22%3A7" title="Genesis 22:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 22:7)</span></a></span> The father replied, <span class="scripture">&#8220;My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+22%3A8" title="Genesis 22:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 22:8)</span></a></span> The child went happily on his way, never thinking he was that lamb. Had the father told his son that he (Isaac) was to be slain and burnt upon the altar, in fear he would have seen the glare of the knife and have heard the crackling of the flames, and he would have failed to see the angel&#8217;s delivering hand.</p>

<p>Behind every cross there is a crown; beyond every shadow there is sunshine; below the rapids is the still water. If you were to see the cross in the distance, you might shrink back and consequently never wear the crown: if you saw the deepening shadow, you might never enjoy the sunshine; if you hear the rapids roar, you might never sail your bark on the tranquil waters. Not until the cross is reached will God give grace to bear the cross. Put your hand in God&#8217;s and trust Him every step of the way&#8212;</p>

<p class="verse">Do not seek to know the future,
<br />Do not stop to question why;
<br />Follow where the Savior leads you,
<br />Trust Him, trust Him all the way.</p>

<p>Never fear. He will be with you in the shadow. He will be with you when the waves are dashing your little bark about on life&#8217;s sea. Listen, and in His own time you will hear Him say, &#8220;Peace, be still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8230;&#8203;</p>

<p>Daniel&#8217;s walk with God led him through the den of lions, but it gave him victory over his enemies and brought him into greater favor with the king. The three young Hebrews that walked with God were led through the fiery furnace, but their promotion in the king&#8217;s court lay just beyond. Peter&#8217;s walk with God led him through the dungeon, but an angel&#8217;s visit was awaiting him. Paul&#8217;s walk led him through the perils of the sea, through hunger and fastings, through weariness and painfulness, through cold and nakedness, through perils of robbers and perils in the wilderness, through stoning and beating and whippings. Imagine this old man with his back bared and bowed beneath the lash. Hear the heavy strokes as they fall; see the blood flowing from the wounds; listen&#8212;what is that we hear him saying? Is he saying, &#8220;The way is too hard; the Lord has treated me too cruelly, and I will walk no more with Him&#8221;? Listen more closely. Ah! he is saying, &#8220;None of these things move me. Nothing shall separate me from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus, my Lord. I reach forth to those things before; I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Henceforth a crown of righteousness is laid up for me&#8221; (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+20%3A24%3B+Romans+8%3A39%3B+Philippians+3%3A13-14%3B+2+Timothy+4%3A8">Acts 20:24; Romans 8:39; Philippians 3:13-14; II&nbsp;Timothy 4:8</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>I just received the <a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_11/index.html" title="Dear Princess 11">Fall 1999</a> issue of DP. It was (again) such a blessing! Many of the articles dealt with issues I&#8217;d been pondering on lately. I really needed the encouragment on page five, &#8220;Do not let the devil tell you it is boastful or prideful to write and share what God has taught you&#8212;you are only glorifying the Teacher, which we are commanded to do.&#8221; That&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;d been thinking!</p>

<p>Abigail&#8217;s letter from the editress was &#8220;right down my alley.&#8221; Basically, the Father has been asking me, &#8220;do you want what is good or what is best? Many of the things/ways you want are good but what I have cut out for you is best.&#8221; Thank God for His Divine help in submitting our wills to His perfect one!</p>

<p>Another thing the Lord has been showing me (He does it so gently!) is that the desire to be a wife and mother is not at all wrong (we humans tend to go to one extreme or the other, God wants us to be balanced). What is wrong is when it&#8217;s an obsession, when it consumes most of our thoughts, when being a wife is so glorious that being a daughter/sister is almost contemptible; when you&#8217;re so busy dreaming of the service done for a family of your own that you overlook the multitude of opportunities with parents and siblings, when your dreams turn into rebellious thoughts of &#8220;at least <i>then</i> I&#8217;ll do things my own way,&#8221; when the thought of wife/motherhood enters your mind without an &#8220;if the Lord wills,&#8221; when you begin to worry and fret about if and when and how and where God sends a man for you, those are the warning signs that it has gone over board. I&#8217;ve given and regiven (and I&#8217;m still doing it!) all my plans and hopes to God. It&#8217;s not easy (praise God we have His help!) when they&#8217;ve been there for years, but
<span class="scripture">&#8220;brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark of the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+3%3A13" title="Philippians 3:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 3:13)</span></a></span>
I have no doubt that His calling for me is far and above anything I could imagine or hope for (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+64%3A4">Isaiah 64:4</a>).
And no matter what He does or doesn&#8217;t give me, He Himself is more than sufficient for me!</p>

<p>I hope and pray God continues to use and bless this publication as He has. It&#8217;s such an encouragement to me to know that there are other young ladies out there with the desire to draw closer to their Lord. I can relate to many of the letters&#8230;. Is this new year/century/millenium going to find you plodding along the same as always or will it find you with an earnest desire to live daily on a higher plane, more in sweet communion with your Savior?</p>

<p>God bless you all.</p>

<p>Greetings in Jesus&#8217; Name! The Lord has been very gracious to me in healing my body a few months ago and I praise Him.</p>

<p>One afternoon in late September, we came home from doing errands. I had felt fine all day, but shortly after my stomach started feeling &#8220;off.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t eat that night, but just went upstairs to bed. I had never been in bed for sickness until the year before when we had trouble with the flu. I thought it was probably the stomach flu and I would feel better the next day. (The stomach flu the year before was really bad. We couldn&#8217;t eat, and even tiny sips of water would make our stomachs unbearably painful.) Well, the next day was no better, nor was the next day. As with the stomach flu, I didn&#8217;t eat, and I had only enough water to keep me hydrated. Actually, with the third day, it got worse, in that I had a sharp pain in my lower right side, along with the stomach flu symptoms. Mama brought me a heating pad and that helped me some. Of course, she and Daddy were concerned. The pain in my side made us think of appendicitis. Daddy had it when he was young, and my great-grandmother had died from it. Our family has long believed in healing; my parents did not feel they should take me to the doctor or anything. I am not saying that there is no circumstance in that you go to a doctor, but only one time in my whole life (I&#8217;m 14) have I gone to a doctor. So we left it up to God. Daddy and Mama began praying and fasting. Daddy annointed me with oil and laid hands on me according to the scripture in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+5%3A13-18">James 5</a>.
The next day (Monday) I felt better, and we were encouraged. Daddy and Mama stopped fasting.</p>

<p>But that night was terrible. The pain in my side became so intense I couldn&#8217;t stay still (giving a new meaning to &#8220;writhing in pain&#8221; for me). The heating pad did no good, lying in any position, or sitting up. I started crying and prayed. The pain gradually lessened until it was quite bearable. I went to sleep and woke up better, but not as well as I was the day before. So Daddy and Mama started fasting again. That day Daddy went to see my grandpa (my mother&#8217;s father), who had been failing in health (he had congestive heart failure), and was able to pray with him for his salvation. Praise the Lord! Daddy had been talking to him about the condition of his soul for a while. Grandpa kept saying he &#8220;wasn&#8217;t ready yet.&#8221; Because of his sickness he had been living with us off and on for three months and was exposed to things of the Lord in a very intense way. No one else in our extended family is a Christian. It was amazing to see how physical battles tie in with spiritual ones.</p>

<p>I slowly but surely got better after that. It wasn&#8217;t till Friday night, seven days after I went down, that I got up and dressed. We went to see my grandpa that night. He had fallen and gone to the hospital. My walking had improved (before I had to hunch over, or else the pain would be too great) though I was rather slow. It hurt to walk fast. I hadn&#8217;t eaten anything all week, but was drinking water, so I was pretty weak. Countless times on that trip Mama asked me, &#8220;Are you okay?&#8221;</p>

<p>Through the following days I improved, and by the next Friday I was totally better. We went to my grandpa&#8217;s house every day that week (it takes an hour to drive there), and on Friday he passed away. He was saved ten days before he died. We are praising the Lord for His mercy to him and what joy we have in knowing Grandpa is with the Lord! He was 77 years old.</p>

<p>I did not go to the doctor. God alone healed me of whatever I was sick with. He is truly the Great Physician!</p>

<h1>Growing in Grace</h1>

<p class="author">Jennie C. Rutty</p>

<p>Some might think that as we receive so much at one time in salvation and sanctification, there would be nothing left for the future and Christian life would become all monotonous; but that is just the opposite, for the two works of grace only prepare us to grow in grace and in the knowledge of God, for we come into fellowship with Him and He can reveal the wonderful things of God by the Spirit dwelling within our hearts.</p>

<p>The way to have a good time in the service of God is to be so intent on doing and being all that shall please Him, that there is no thought of self, and then the way will be strewn with richest joys, that are often brought to light by passing through severe trials.</p>

<p class="verse">For as the sun doth always shine
<br />Beyond the clouds, so these of mine
<br />Are forms that veil the one above,
<br />Who gives us ever, life and love.</p>

<p>The trials pass away as clouds, and the glorious presence of God is so enjoyed and more highly prized than before. Do you remember when the Lord Jesus was so severely tempted by the Devil, that when He faithfully rebuked him by using the sword of the Spirit, the word of God, angels came and ministered unto Him? Thus it is, when we endure sorrows, privations, cares, trials, and temptations, as followers of the meek and lowly Lord should, that the sustaining grace and power of God are realized; and as the trials pass away, there is a sweet ministration as from angels, and our souls are raised to higher realms of love and glory.</p>

<p>When we have dearly beloved earthly friends, we love to be in their presence, hear their words of love and counsel, and feel the sweet emotions that thrill and fill affectionate hearts. This is the fellowship of pure natural love. When we take our Bible, enter into our closets, and realize the Lord&#8217;s presence there and that there is nothing standing between us to hinder the flow of divine love, read His loving messages from the sacred Word, then fall on our knees in humility before Him and claim by faith those messages and promises as belonging to us, from the deep of our hearts well up thanksgiving and praise for His great loving-kindness, and in loving boldness we ask gracious favors from His bountiful hands; our cup of joy runneth over, for this is the sweet communion and fellowship of the Holy Spirit in secret devotion. But, through hours of toil, sadness, and trial, we may constantly realize this precious fellowship with God, as from the depths of our souls there is a hearty amen to all His will, and we move forward in the narrow way, hearing and obeying all the divine revelations of truth.</p>

<p>Then there comes in connection with the fellowship with God and His Son, through the Spirit, the fellowship of saints, which is but poorly imitated by many different religious organizations of today. Each one of God&#8217;s true children, having the Spirit of God, filled with divine love, walking in the same way, having the same aspirations to do God&#8217;s holy will, realizes</p>

<p class="verse">Oh, brethren, how this perfect love<br />Unites us all in Jesus!<br />One heart, and soul, and mind, we prove<br />The union heaven gave us.<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/The_Bond_of_Perfectness/index.html" title="The Bond of Perfectness">*</a></p>

<p>The more we love God, the purer and sweeter will be the fellowship of God&#8217;s dear children, and it is His will that we abound more and more in brotherly love.</p>

<p>We may grow in the knowledge of God by the unfolding of the scriptures to our minds and hearts. Let us glance at several verses and let the Spirit apply their language to enrapture and fascinate our souls with a deeper knowledge of God and love for truth.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valleys.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Song+2%3A1" title="Song 2:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Song 2:1)</span></a></span>
Jesus is here spoken of as a beautiful rose, and those who love nature in its many forms of beauty will see here a precious lesson. As this rose of Sharon, the queen of flowers, symbolizes Christ, we learn of His attractive beauty, that we may be drawn to Him, and sink out of ourselves into Him and partake of His lovely nature, that we all may live lives of Christ-like beauty with the holy fragrance of divine love. He is again symbolized by the lily of the valleys, to bring to our notice His delicate Christly purity, that we may shrink from the gaudiness of worldly life, and covet this purity that can shine from the valleys of human misery and woe in untarnished beauty.</p>

<p>Jesus is also called
<span class="scripture">&#8220;the bright and morning star,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+22%3A16" title="Revelation 22:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 22:16)</span></a></span>
and is promised to those who keep His works, and have Jesus abiding
<span class="scripture">&#8220;in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+3%3A17-19" title="Ephesians 3:17-19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 3:17-19)</span></a></span>
Could there be a greater treasure than this marvelous love that may be known, and yet is beyond knowledge? For while we know it in the salvation of our souls, we may not comprehend it&#8217;s vastness; but be filled with all the fullness of God, for we may have all our hearts can contain of perfect God love, and as we grow in grace we can comprehend more of it, and better appreciate its value.</p>

<p>Now, by the help of the Lord, I want to show you a beautiful vision, that some of you may learn the precious lesson that was taught to me by the Holy Spirit. I saw myself in company with a dear sister, who was robed in the most beautiful garment of dazzling whiteness, walking through an edifice of grandeur and beauty, through which flowed a river whose waters were crystal clear and whose waves and dashing spray glistened like purest gems. As we stood admiring its untold loveliness, the sister plunged into the crystal tide and held up to my astonished eyes many indescribable beauties, as she said in tones of sweet reproach, &#8220;Oh, how few of the many who abide here really understand or enjoy the many treasures that are given to us as children of God!&#8221; This encouraged me to explore the building, and I was filled with glory, as an understanding was given to me as I saw its glories and preciousness. Finally, a long stairway was reached, and, as I stood, hesitating about descending, because of its apparent tiresomeness, sounds of feasting and joy issued from below the stairway and I longed to descend and partake with them of their joys. Just then somone approached and offered His hand, and, as I put mine into His, confidence, sweet peace, comfort, and security filled my heart, and down the stairway we glided with perfect ease. As the bottom was reached, a consciousness of the truth was given, and I said, &#8220;Yea, Lord, down to the very depths of humility I will go, for Thou art with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I saw the great building was the church of God and through it flowed the river of life, to be enjoyed by all the inhabitants of the house, and, as it was enjoyed and appreciated, new treasures appeared to enrapture the heart and glorify the Giver. If we would really partake of the feasting and holy fellowship of Jesus, we must let Him conduct us to His own humility, step by step, as He shows us our need and with Him it is precious, oh, so precious to the soul.</p>

<p>By humbling ourselves before God, studying His word with a strong desire to know His will, and in carefulness to walk therein, we shall grow in grace and in His knowledge. He desires us to be truly devoted and pious, praying without ceasing, rejoicing in trials, submitting to His holy will&#8212;thus living and walking to His glory and praise.</p>
