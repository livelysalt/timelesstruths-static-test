<h1>What Do Religions Offer Womanhood?</h1>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">BUDDHISM looks at woman thus: &#8220;Just as when the disease called mildew falls upon the field of rice in fine condition, that field of rice does not continue long; just so under whatsoever doctrine and discipline women are allowed, that religion will not last long. Bad conduct is the taint of women. Verily, the life of women is always darkness.&#8221;</p>

<p>ISLAM: &#8220;Men are superior to women on account of the qualities which God hath gifted the one above the other. Ye may divorce your wives twice; and then either retain them with humanity or dismiss them with kindness. Of other women who seem good to your eyes, take two, or three, or four.&#8221;</p>

<p>CONFUCIANISM: &#8220;The Master said, &#8216;Of all people, girls and servants are the most difficult to behave to. If you are familiar with them, they lose their humility. If you maintain a reserve toward them, they are discontented. The woman follows and obeys the man. In her youth, she follows her father and elder brother. When married, she follows her son.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>HINDUISM: &#8220;With women there can be no lasting friendship; hearts of hyenas are the hearts of women. The husband should not eat in the presence of his wife. Such indeed is the divine ordinance. Women, the low-caste Sundre, the dog, the blow crow, are untruth. Stealing grain, base metals, or cattle, slaying women and low-caste Sundres, and atheism are all minor offenses.&#8221;</p>

<p>But now let us see what Christ has done for woman.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife; And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+10%3A6-9" title="Mark 10:6-9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 10:6-9)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+3%3A28" title="Galatians 3:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 3:28)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Christian women, would you exchange your Christ for any other religion? Then, do you owe anything to the One who made your exalted position possible? Christian men, are you glad that your mothers and sisters are not held down in a hopeless heathen bondage? The woman in a Christian land enjoys the loftiest position of her kind.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The above article was found in an out-of-print book, <i>Food for the Body and for the Soul</i>. Each time I have read it, my heart fills with deep thanksgiving for Christ&#8217;s love and equality to humankind. There is liberty in Christ. Liberty for the man and liberty for the woman.
God has made a wonderful plan (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A21-31">Ephesians 5:21-31</a>).
He has created us to be help meets to our husbands, to love and submit to them in all things, putting only Himself above that area.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+3%3A1" title="Colossians 3:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 3:1)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A22" title="Ephesians 5:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 5:22)</span></a></span>
The Phillip&#8217;s translation renders it, &#8220;You wives must learn to adapt yourselves to your husbands, as you submit yourselves to the Lord.&#8221; Our biggest place of submission is to God. Then the other part to our husbands will fall more easily in place. Oh, what a responsible place wives fill! We are to be
a help meet (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+2%3A18">Genesis 2:18</a>),
a crown (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+12%3A4">Proverbs 12:4</a>),
and yet our biggest responsibility is to keep our own soul clear before God. He has given our souls to us and put it in our hands.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;He that keepeth the commandment <b>keepeth his own soul</b>.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+19%3A1" title="Proverbs 19:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 19:1)</span></a></span>
We shall each stand before God alone and give account for our own deeds. Our husbands will not stand in for us at the judgment.</p>


<p>My heart was saddened while talking to a young mother at a homeschool book fair. We had exchanged acquaintance and she was speaking of where they were currently attending church services. I asked her a question. She wasn&#8217;t sure about it, and so casually remarked, &#8220;The men will study it out.&#8221; How about this, sisters? Are we taking this attitude?
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Study to shew <i>thyself</i> approved unto God, a workman that needeth not be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A15" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 2:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 2:15)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>I clearly remember a message I heard shortly after my marriage. There was also another newly-married couple in the congregation. The pastor carried a burden for us. One Sunday morning the Lord led him to speak of wives not leaning on their husband&#8217;s experience, but to keep our own up-to-date with the Lord. He said, &#8220;Now you may have a good, saved husband, and it is right for him to be the head and leader of your home, but he can&#8217;t give you the grace and spiritual strength you need for the trials of life.&#8221; We can only look to God for the needed spiritual growth.</p>

<p>Some husbands are not living for the Lord. One scripture bears this out.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation [conduct] of the wives.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A1" title="I&nbsp;Peter 3:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 3:1)</span></a></span>
We are all individuals before God. The Lord will give light and understanding as we each open our hearts to His word. If our husband is not obeying the word in a given area and we do have light, how would we be a help meet to him if we do not stand true to the conviction God has given us? If we explain in meekness and humility and keep much in prayer, in time, the Lord will reveal to our husbands also. But I repeat, how important it is to hold it in meekness and humility and to keep bathed in prayer. You know, it is possible to be holding a right precept with a wrong attitude! Christ is our example.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+1%3A47" title="John 1:47"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 1:47)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Our family has just finished reading <a href="../../../texts/A_Religious_Controversy/index.html" title="A Religious Controversy">A Religious Controversy</a> together. It is a story of a husband and wife. They had each been church members for years. But, she became painfully aware of the lack of victory in her life. The Lord put conviction upon her heart, and God gave her a real experience of salvation at a revival meeting. She would come home and tell him about the message. Her husband would have none of it. But by her life and example, he too became convicted of his need of salvation. This sister had prayed for her husband and lived the verse in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A1">I&nbsp;Peter 3:1</a>.
It bore fruit and brought them into spiritual unity. How great was their happiness at this new oneness in Christ! This would have not been possible if she had not been true to light shone on her path.</p>

<p>The Lord is no respecter of persons of male or female. He wants a personal relationship with each of us. The Bible bears this out. There are times when the spirit of the Lord witnesses to both genders. Consider Mary and Joseph, Elizabeth and Zacharias. In the temple there was devoted Simon whom the Holy Ghost was upon and the prophetess Anna to whom God also revealed Himself. Consider the story of Manoah and his wife in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Judges+13">Judges 13</a>.
The angel of the Lord first appeared to Manoah&#8217;s wife and promised them a son. She told her husband; this brought him to prayer. He entreated the Lord to send the man of God again. God hearkened and the angel of God came again to the woman while she was alone in the field. She ran to get her husband and the angel of God spoke to both of them. Manoah&#8217;s heart was filled with thanksgiving and offered a sacrifice. When the flame went up toward heaven, the angel ascended in the flame. Manoah and his wife looked on and fell on their faces to the ground. Manoah became fearful and said,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;We shall surely die, because we have seen God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Judges+13%3A22" title="Judges 13:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Judges 13:22)</span></a></span>
Here at this time of fearfulness, Manoah&#8217;s wife was a crown and a true help meet to him. Her faith was not shaken and she replied,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;If the Lord were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would he at this time have told us such things as these.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Judges+13%3A23" title="Judges 13:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Judges 13:23)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>An older sister, a minister&#8217;s wife, has said that in times when she was feeling low and discouraged, her husband was a comfort and encouragement to her. Likewise, when he was going through trying times and needed encouragement, she was able to encourage him. Isn&#8217;t the Lord good? He will not give us more than we can bear, but will make a way of escape. The Lord designed us to be workers together. How sweet and precious is a union&#8212;one in flesh and also in spirit!</p>

<p>Oh, how we thank the Lord for His word and the understanding He gives. May we each one receive it with open hearts.</p>

<p class="signature">With Christian love and prayer,<br />A sister in Christ</p>
