<h1>Hindrances to Spiritual Fellowship</h1>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;He went on frowardly in the way of his heart.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+57%3A17" title="Isaiah 57:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 57:17)</span></a></span></p>

<p>From time to time, we have known dear precious souls who had a love for God and for whom God had done some wonderful things. They possessed some valuable attributes of character and were walking in all the light that they had. Some of them had less light than others, and some of them had been walking with God in honesty for a while, whereas others had just gotten started.</p>

<p>We cannot recall any occasion of meeting such dear ones without recalling the great joy that welled up in our heart. In each case, the expectation was the same&#8212;an intense hope that they would continue to walk in the light and &#8220;go all the way&#8221; with the Lord, just as far as the Spirit of God would lead them.</p>

<p>For we knew, according to
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1%3A7">I&nbsp;John 1:7</a>,
that an individual walking in the light (as He is in the light) is the basis of all fellowship with God and with each other. And we longed and still long to be with all who love God and His Truth above anything else,and who prove it by
paying any price to buy the Truth (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+23%3A23">Proverbs 23:23</a>).
</p>

<p>We wish we could tell you that each and every situation has turned out well, but we cannot. Indeed, most of them have not.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+10%3A2" title="Mark 10:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 10:2)</span></a></span>
His possessions were not really very great at all, as compared to the riches of the Kingdom of Heaven, but he did not see that. <b>He loved his possessions more than truth.</b> This has always been the problem. There is something that matters more than a clear, definite consciousness that everything is all right between you and God. As long as this is true, you cannot be led by the Spirit of God&#8212;you will be led by the voices of other things.</p>

<p>In
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+14%3A18-20">Luke 14:18-20</a>,
we are given a list of things that meant more than God&#8217;s requirements. One was listening to the voice of lands, so he must needs disregard the voice of God. Another had acquired some new agricultural equipment, and the voice of his vocation prevented him. Still another put his marriage ahead of God. And so it goes;
<span class="scripture">&#8220;they all with one consent began to make excuse.&#8221;</span>
Evidently, they&#8217;d had some connection with God, for they were the first invited to the feast. But their true spiritual condition becomes apparent when we read,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+12%3A2" title="Romans 12:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 12:2)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>We are satisfied that it is utterly impossible to be led by the Spirit of God if we are not fully surrendered to Him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">There is a way out of all these difficulties, to the fully surrendered soul. I would repeat, fully surrendered, because <b>if there is any reserve of will upon any point, it becomes almost impossible to find out the mind of God in reference to that point;</b> and therefore the first thing is to be sure that you really do purpose to obey the Lord in every respect. If however this is the case, and your soul only needs to know the will of God in order to consent to it, then you surely cannot doubt His willingness to make His will known, and to guide you in the right paths.</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[Smith, Hannah W.; <a href="../../../texts/The_Christians_Secret_of_a_Happy_Life/index.html"><i>The Christian&#8217;s Secret of a Happy Life</i></a>, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/The_Christians_Secret_of_a_Happy_Life/Difficulties_Concerning_Guidance/index.html">Difficulties Concerning Guidance</a>&#8221;]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>Now, hardly anyone that I know who has backed up on God, and stopped walking in the light they were given from heaven, has admitted it. Most seem to balk at some thing that they do not want to do, and they seek to minimize it in their minds. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t really matter to the Lord&#8230;.&#8221; Only, as time proves, it does. The fruit that is eventually borne in the life that walks away rather than in, proves it. At first, some of the excuses may have the appearance of being plausible and may make a brave showing in the flesh. But if we heed the Bible admonition to
<span class="scripture">&#8220;prove all things; hold fast that which is good,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+5%3A21" title="I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:21)</span></a></span>
then
<span class="scripture">&#8220;ye shall know them by their fruits.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+7%3A16" title="Matthew 7:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 7:16)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>It is exceedingly dangerous to trifle with any point of truth, once we are convicted that it is truth. Wavering, disputing and arguing with God will open you to a spirit of deception. It is extremely dangerous not to obey the Bible.</p>

<p>In the cases mentioned above, something would begin to manifest itself&#8212;something that is not according to the Word of God and contrary to it. One family was in violation of the Scriptures on a certain point, and we were unaware of it. In due time, it came out. We could not accept them without being a partaker of their sin. After a long time of waiting and praying, we put before them
<span class="scripture">&#8220;the words of this life,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+5%3A20" title="Acts 5:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 5:20)</span></a></span>
as gently and clearly as we could, asking them if the Lord had ever dealt with them on this point. They were highly offended and broke off all contact at all levels, thus sadly informing us of the answer to our question. We love them yet, but we still love the truth of God&#8217;s Word even more, and we continue to pray for them.</p>

<p>In another case, there seemed to be some real merit from heaven in their lives, and they had obeyed the Lord in a matter at real cost to themselves. Surely, we thought, here are folks who want to follow the Lord all the way. But, after a little contact, a certain lack of warmth and fellowship was noticed, and we did not know why. Then, from time to time, certain false notes were heard. A lack of vision was apparent. It brought a heavy burden of prayer. It seemed they had entered into another spirit and accepted it. But, then that was removed, and to our amazement, they reversed and went back on certain key aspects of their stand before. Our heart is deeply grieved for them. Beyond doubt, they are not being led by the Spirit of God.</p>

<p><b>How impossible it is for those who are not led by the Spirit of God to fit in with those who are.</b></p>

<p>Men&#8217;s organizations do not have this problem. They are created by people and run by people, and people, led by the priorities and values of the natural man, can find a suitable home for the condition of their heart.</p>

<p>But
God&#8217;s people, who were once not a people (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+2%3A10">I&nbsp;Peter 2:10</a>),
are a people identified and defined by their supreme love for God and His ways.
By a marvelous Divine operation, His laws are written in their very hearts and minds (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+8%3A10%2C+10%3A16">Hebrews 8:10, 10:16</a>),
and this produces a people who must have and who&#8212;praise His precious Name&#8212;do have
<span class="scripture">&#8220;like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+1%3A1" title="II&nbsp;Peter 1:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 1:1)</span></a></span>
<b>They must have the truth.</b> They cannot live without it. Without it, they will cease to be the people of God. <b>They must have the truth, and they must do it.</b> The love of God&#8217;s truth is a burning flame in their heart. It guides their lives.</p>

<p>They must <i>know</i>. They cannot afford to be ambiguous about what truth is. The vagueness that works for the nominal professor of Christianity is death to them. Scriptures, such as this, speak in tones of absolute authority to the true child of God.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A1" title="Ephesians 5:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 5:1)</span></a></span>
With the saints in Berea,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+17%3A11" title="Acts 17:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 17:11)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>We have found some of the Lord&#8217;s little children who love Him more than anything else. God changed them and made them that way. He wants to change all and make us all to be &#8220;raised up together,&#8221; and to
<span class="scripture">&#8220;sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+2%3A6" title="Ephesians 2:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 2:6)</span></a></span>
It is God who designed His salvation to make us love Him and His Truth above anything else. He is able.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+4%3A24" title="John 4:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 4:24)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The hour cometh, and now is, when <b>the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth</b>: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+4%3A2" title="John 4:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 4:2)</span></a></span>
