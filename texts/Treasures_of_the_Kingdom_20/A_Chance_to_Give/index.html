<h1>A Chance to Give</h1>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_20/give_praying.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="317" /></div>
<p>Daniel wanted to serve Jesus and please Him. For several weeks now when he woke up he would kneel to pray. This morning Daniel was in a rush and it was the picture of Jesus knocking at the door that reminded him. <i>Oh,</i> he thought, <i>I almost forgot!</i> Kneeling beside his bed Daniel could imagine Jesus standing there, waiting to talk to him. &#8220;Dear Lord,&#8221; he prayed, &#8220;help me obey and listen to You today. For Jesus&#8217; sake, amen.&#8221;</p>

<p>All day Daniel was busy helping Chad outside and playing with his sisters. It wasn&#8217;t until Dad called him in for devotions that Daniel thought of his prayer. He sat down quietly with his Bible and looked again at the picture of Jesus knocking. <i>I&#8217;d better listen carefully, because the Bible is like Jesus talking to us,</i> he thought. <i>I wonder what He wants to say?</i></p>

<p>That evening Dad read a verse in Proverbs about giving to the poor. &#8220;Poor people are those that don&#8217;t have the things they need,&#8221; he said. Daniel knew there were people that didn&#8217;t have food or a house to live in. <i>It must be hard for them,</i> he thought, remembering how he had been afraid they would be poor when Dad lost his job. But God had taken care of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Lord has blessed us with food, and shelter, and strength,&#8221; Dad was saying. &#8220;We need His love in our hearts to really care about the needy people around us. Then we will be ready to give when the chance comes.&#8221; <i>How can I give to poor people?</i> Daniel wondered, as they knelt down together. <i>I don&#8217;t have much, but maybe I can save up. Giving will be fun!</i></p>

<p>In the next few days Daniel came up with many ideas of what he could do. There was a newspaper route he could get nearby to earn some money, or maybe they could get rid of their extra stuff and have a big yard sale. Rosie liked that idea and was pulling things out of the closet when big-sister Irene stopped them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The house needs to be cleaned, not messed up,&#8221; she said. Mother told them that, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe we can think of it later, but for now you have chores to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel felt glum as he vacuumed the floor. How could he give when he didn&#8217;t have any chance? Rosie was more cheerful. &#8220;Let&#8217;s work hard and then maybe we can do something.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel didn&#8217;t answer, but he thought of Dad&#8217;s words: &#8220;We need God&#8217;s love in our hearts to really care.&#8221; He whispered a little prayer for help: <i>Dear Jesus, help me be loving and know how to give. I want to be ready when the chance comes.</i></p>

<p>It was that very afternoon that his chance came. They had gone to town, and on the way home Mom took them to the park for a treat. &#8220;Yippee!&#8221; Daniel hollered as he took off across the green grass toward the play set. &#8220;Race you, Chad!&#8221; It was when they came panting up to the drinking fountain that Daniel saw the boy in the wheelchair.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_20/give_wheelchair.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="245" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; Daniel said, not knowing what to do. Handicapped people always seemed strange.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi,&#8221; said the boy in a slow, sad voice. He looked sort of hunched sitting there, and Daniel wondered what it would be like to never run or play like everyone else. <i>What does he do all day?</i> Daniel asked himself as he climbed the tallest slide. <i>It probably isn&#8217;t very fun for him in the park.</i></p>

<p>Whoosh! Daniel felt a rush of air as he started sliding faster and faster. What fun it was! In a second he had landed with a bump at the bottom. When he looked around he saw that the boy in the wheelchair was watching him.</p>

<p>A voice whispered, <i>He is lonely. Why don&#8217;t you go over and cheer him up?</i> Daniel stood looking at the boy for a minute, wondering what he could even say. <i>I will try!</i> he said to himself. <i>And Jesus will help me.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Do you live near here?&#8221; Daniel asked, walking over to where the boy sat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; the boy said, and sighed. &#8220;But it&#8217;s not very fun, so we don&#8217;t come much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be kind of hard just watching,&#8221; Daniel said slowly. &#8220;What do you like to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I have this friend that usually plays baseball with me, but he&#8217;s on vacation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like baseball,&#8221; Daniel said quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t bring my bat and ball today.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_20/give_reading.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="175" /></div>
<p>Daniel thought a minute. &#8220;Do you like to read?&#8221; he asked, remembering his library books in the car. &#8220;I have a really nice one on airplanes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy smiled slowly. &#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel ran off for the book, and was soon sitting in the shade with his new friend. They studied the old gliders and read about the Wright Brothers&#8217; first flying machine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t that have been great? Just imagine being the first people to fly!&#8221; the boy said excitedly, and Daniel grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever been in an airplane?&#8221; he asked, as they turned the pages to the airliners and high-speed jets.</p>

<p>The boy nodded. &#8220;Just once, and it was great! Have you?&#8221; Daniel shook his head. &#8220;We were going to Florida,&#8221; the boy continued, &#8220;and I got to sit by the window. Wow! Everything looks really different from the air.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed all too soon when Mother called that it was time to go. &#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; Daniel said, as he picked up the book and got to his feet. &#8220;That was fun, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; the boy agreed. &#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That boy really liked the airplane book,&#8221; Daniel told Mom on the way home. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad I got it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m happy to see you sharing. That was a wonderful opportunity to give to the poor, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel looked up, surprised. &#8220;That boy didn&#8217;t look poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was handicapped and lonely, and you made a difference by caring about him,&#8221; Mom said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess so,&#8221; Daniel said slowly, and he felt very happy. He had listened to Jesus and his chance had come.</p>
