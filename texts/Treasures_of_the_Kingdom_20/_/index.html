<h1>A Chance to Give</h1>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_20/give_praying.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="317" /></div>
<p>Daniel wanted to serve Jesus and please Him. For several weeks now when he woke up he would kneel to pray. This morning Daniel was in a rush and it was the picture of Jesus knocking at the door that reminded him. <i>Oh,</i> he thought, <i>I almost forgot!</i> Kneeling beside his bed Daniel could imagine Jesus standing there, waiting to talk to him. &#8220;Dear Lord,&#8221; he prayed, &#8220;help me obey and listen to You today. For Jesus&#8217; sake, amen.&#8221;</p>

<p>All day Daniel was busy helping Chad outside and playing with his sisters. It wasn&#8217;t until Dad called him in for devotions that Daniel thought of his prayer. He sat down quietly with his Bible and looked again at the picture of Jesus knocking. <i>I&#8217;d better listen carefully, because the Bible is like Jesus talking to us,</i> he thought. <i>I wonder what He wants to say?</i></p>

<p>That evening Dad read a verse in Proverbs about giving to the poor. &#8220;Poor people are those that don&#8217;t have the things they need,&#8221; he said. Daniel knew there were people that didn&#8217;t have food or a house to live in. <i>It must be hard for them,</i> he thought, remembering how he had been afraid they would be poor when Dad lost his job. But God had taken care of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Lord has blessed us with food, and shelter, and strength,&#8221; Dad was saying. &#8220;We need His love in our hearts to really care about the needy people around us. Then we will be ready to give when the chance comes.&#8221; <i>How can I give to poor people?</i> Daniel wondered, as they knelt down together. <i>I don&#8217;t have much, but maybe I can save up. Giving will be fun!</i></p>

<p>In the next few days Daniel came up with many ideas of what he could do. There was a newspaper route he could get nearby to earn some money, or maybe they could get rid of their extra stuff and have a big yard sale. Rosie liked that idea and was pulling things out of the closet when big-sister Irene stopped them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The house needs to be cleaned, not messed up,&#8221; she said. Mother told them that, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe we can think of it later, but for now you have chores to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel felt glum as he vacuumed the floor. How could he give when he didn&#8217;t have any chance? Rosie was more cheerful. &#8220;Let&#8217;s work hard and then maybe we can do something.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel didn&#8217;t answer, but he thought of Dad&#8217;s words: &#8220;We need God&#8217;s love in our hearts to really care.&#8221; He whispered a little prayer for help: <i>Dear Jesus, help me be loving and know how to give. I want to be ready when the chance comes.</i></p>

<p>It was that very afternoon that his chance came. They had gone to town, and on the way home Mom took them to the park for a treat. &#8220;Yippee!&#8221; Daniel hollered as he took off across the green grass toward the play set. &#8220;Race you, Chad!&#8221; It was when they came panting up to the drinking fountain that Daniel saw the boy in the wheelchair.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_20/give_wheelchair.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="245" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; Daniel said, not knowing what to do. Handicapped people always seemed strange.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi,&#8221; said the boy in a slow, sad voice. He looked sort of hunched sitting there, and Daniel wondered what it would be like to never run or play like everyone else. <i>What does he do all day?</i> Daniel asked himself as he climbed the tallest slide. <i>It probably isn&#8217;t very fun for him in the park.</i></p>

<p>Whoosh! Daniel felt a rush of air as he started sliding faster and faster. What fun it was! In a second he had landed with a bump at the bottom. When he looked around he saw that the boy in the wheelchair was watching him.</p>

<p>A voice whispered, <i>He is lonely. Why don&#8217;t you go over and cheer him up?</i> Daniel stood looking at the boy for a minute, wondering what he could even say. <i>I will try!</i> he said to himself. <i>And Jesus will help me.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Do you live near here?&#8221; Daniel asked, walking over to where the boy sat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; the boy said, and sighed. &#8220;But it&#8217;s not very fun, so we don&#8217;t come much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be kind of hard just watching,&#8221; Daniel said slowly. &#8220;What do you like to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I have this friend that usually plays baseball with me, but he&#8217;s on vacation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like baseball,&#8221; Daniel said quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t bring my bat and ball today.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_20/give_reading.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="175" /></div>
<p>Daniel thought a minute. &#8220;Do you like to read?&#8221; he asked, remembering his library books in the car. &#8220;I have a really nice one on airplanes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy smiled slowly. &#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel ran off for the book, and was soon sitting in the shade with his new friend. They studied the old gliders and read about the Wright Brothers&#8217; first flying machine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t that have been great? Just imagine being the first people to fly!&#8221; the boy said excitedly, and Daniel grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever been in an airplane?&#8221; he asked, as they turned the pages to the airliners and high-speed jets.</p>

<p>The boy nodded. &#8220;Just once, and it was great! Have you?&#8221; Daniel shook his head. &#8220;We were going to Florida,&#8221; the boy continued, &#8220;and I got to sit by the window. Wow! Everything looks really different from the air.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed all too soon when Mother called that it was time to go. &#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; Daniel said, as he picked up the book and got to his feet. &#8220;That was fun, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; the boy agreed. &#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That boy really liked the airplane book,&#8221; Daniel told Mom on the way home. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad I got it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m happy to see you sharing. That was a wonderful opportunity to give to the poor, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel looked up, surprised. &#8220;That boy didn&#8217;t look poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was handicapped and lonely, and you made a difference by caring about him,&#8221; Mom said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess so,&#8221; Daniel said slowly, and he felt very happy. He had listened to Jesus and his chance had come.</p>

<h1>Inside Out</h1>

<p>Do you know that our inside life shows out in what we do? Jesus says if we love Him in our hearts, we must show that by what we <b>do</b>. What should we do if we love Jesus? Think about how your Mom and Dad show their love to you. They work for you and spend time with you, don&#8217;t they? It is by what they do that we know they love us. So if we love Jesus, we should be doing things that please Him. He says, &#8220;If you love me, keep my commandments.&#8221; That means that we should obey Him.</p>

<p>In the story, Daniel is learning what it means to obey Jesus. First we must want His way inside us. When God changes us <b>inside</b>, then it will show on the <b>outside</b>. We will want to pray and read the Bible. We will want to help others. But if we have a sinful heart inside, that will show on the outside, too. It will show by complaints and wanting our selfish way. We won&#8217;t want to talk to Jesus, because we don&#8217;t love Him. Even if we pretend we are good, the bad in our hearts will come out. We had better get our hearts right so that we can live right!</p>

<p>Daniel wanted to serve Jesus and obey Him. When he listened to the Bible verse about giving to the poor, Daniel tried to think of ways he could help. In his heart God had changed him so he didn&#8217;t just think about himself. He had love in his heart for others and it showed on the outside. Just like Daniel, sometimes we might get certain ideas of how we should serve Jesus. But we must remember that Jesus is the Master and He knows best. He wants us to <i>follow</i> Him, not pull ahead like a wild puppy. When Daniel let go of his own ideas, and followed, Jesus gave him a job to do.</p>

<p>Do you wish you could do something for Jesus? He has important jobs for us to do if we will only listen and obey. If your heart is right, then your life will show it. Daniel got his chance to help a poor person because God&#8217;s love was already inside his heart. Ask Jesus for a loving heart today, and you&#8217;ll be surprised how many chances you&#8217;ll have to serve Him!</p>

<h1>The King&#8217;s Garden Scientist</h1>

<p>A scientist is someone who studies the world God has made. Scientists want to find out <i>how</i> and <i>why</i> things work the way they do. Being curious and asking questions can be a good thing. When you learn that fire can burn your skin, you will be careful not to play around fire. When we learn about life, we can make good choices and live better. So let&#8217;s be a scientist and study things in the King&#8217;s Garden today!</p>

<p>All scientists begin with a question. Our question today is: <i>What can weeds tell us?</i></p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s begin our search for the answers. First, what are weeds? They are plants that grow where we don&#8217;t want them. Such as, <i>dandelions in the lawn.</i> Why are they there? We study the grass a bit. It is looking sort of sickly, isn&#8217;t it? When the soil is poor and the grass gets weak, the dandelions can grow because they have long roots that dig way down where the good soil is. So a lawn full of dandelions says, &#8220;This soil needs fertilizer!&#8221;</p>

<p>Other weeds tell us about the soil, too. Cattails and pussy willows say, &#8220;Wet soil here!&#8221; But wild mustard, a tall weedy plant with yellow flowers, grows where the soil is crusty and hard. Did you know that weeds could tell you so many things?</p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s take a look at some other kinds of weeds. These kind are called <i>weedy tempers</i>. Have you heard of a &#8220;temper tantrum&#8221;? When a little child doesn&#8217;t get the toy he wants, he starts kicking and screaming. What a fuss! Why does he do it? Well, there is a reason, and it is because <i>he is very selfish and hasn&#8217;t been trained.</i></p>

<p>The Bible teaches us about many other bad tempers and why people have them. A jealous temper is <i>disliking someone because of what they have or what they can do.</i> It seems to pop up for no reason, but look closely! If we really love someone, we don&#8217;t mind if they have better things than us. So jealousy tell us, &#8220;This heart needs more love!&#8221; The bitterness temper is the kind that <i>makes us feel angry because someone wasn&#8217;t fair.</i> When we see those bad roots growing we know that we haven&#8217;t forgiven others. But Jesus says we must forgive others before God can forgive us.</p>

<p>The reason scientists study, is to know how to live better. Now that we know these &#8220;weed secrets,&#8221; what should we do? Next time we see a weed growing, let&#8217;s ask the Lord to <i>fix our heart problems.</i></p>

<h2>Your Chance to Give</h2>
<p><b>Look around your neighborhood.</b> Is there someone stuck at home that needs a cheery card or some bright flowers? Think about others!</p>

<p><b>Do you get spending money?</b> Instead of using it only for yourself, set aside some for others. Ask Jesus to show you how to use it.</p>

<p><b>Do you have extra toys and clothes?</b> Ask if you can give them away. You can make a package for a poor child in another country.</p>

<p><b>When you cook with Mom,</b> make something extra for a gift. Cookies, pies, bread, and canned fruit are very special things to give.</p>

<h2>Start Right Away</h2>

<br />Then start right away
<br />Doing some kindness
<br />For someone each day.
<br />Scatter some sunshine;
<br />Forget about self;
<br />Put all your worries

<p class="verse">If you want to be happy,
<br />Just begin to be glad;

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have any friends,&#8221; Sammy complained to Grandpa. &#8220;All the big kids leave me out and say I can&#8217;t come along. I feel sad.&#8221; Grandpa gave him a squeeze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, there is Someone I know that will be your Friend. I&#8217;ll tell you a story about</p>

<h1>Abraham&#8217;s Friend</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+18%3A16-19%3A29">Genesis 18:16-19:29</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Abraham had traveled a long ways from his home. He had come to a strange land where he didn&#8217;t know anyone. Sometimes he must have felt lonely, but he knew of a Friend he could always talk to. It was the Lord God who had called him to Canaan in the first place. And God had promised to never leave him alone. What a good sort of Friend to have!</p>

<p>In the hills of Canaan there weren&#8217;t many people, but Abraham didn&#8217;t mind. He worked hard watching over his great flocks of sheep, herds of cattle, and his many servants. And Abraham always took time to talk to God. It was because he loved the Lord and wanted to please Him that Abraham was called &#8220;The Friend of God.&#8221; Whenever God told him to do something, Abraham was quick to obey. He knew that God always did what was right and good, so Abraham trusted Him.</p>

<p>But the people in the cities below didn&#8217;t love God at all. They were wicked and lived just to please themselves. Abraham didn&#8217;t want to be around them, because if they weren&#8217;t God&#8217;s friends, they couldn&#8217;t be his. But his nephew, Lot, didn&#8217;t feel the same way. I&#8217;m sure Abraham felt sad to see him go live near the city. So he told the Lord God all about it.</p>

<p>Then one day the Lord came and spoke to Abraham. &#8220;Because cities of the plain are so wicked, I will go down and see if they must be destroyed,&#8221; He said. &#8220;Will you destroy the righteous with the wicked?&#8221; Abraham asked. He thought of Lot and his heart was sad. &#8220;What if there are fifty righteous people in the city?&#8221; They talked for a long time as Abraham pled for the city to be saved if there were only a few righteous people. &#8220;If there are only ten, I will save it,&#8221; the Lord said. He loved Abraham and knew what was in his heart. And He knew that there weren&#8217;t even ten people that wanted to live right in that whole city.</p>

<p>It was early the next morning that Abraham went out to look down at the plain. Oh, look! Smoke was billowing high into the sky over the city. What did Abraham think as he watched? He knew his Friend knew all about it and trusted that He had done what was best. He loved God and knew that God would care for Him. And, sure enough, the Lord <i>had</i> remembered Abraham&#8217;s prayer, and had sent Lot out before the city was destroyed.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>&#8220;And the Lord wants to be your Friend, too,&#8221; Grandpa said, when he had finished. Sammy snuggled close and didn&#8217;t say anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;What helped Abraham when he was lonely?&#8221; Grandpa asked after a bit.</p>

<p>&#8220;He prayed to God,&#8221; said Sammy.</p>

<p>&#8220;And why did he do that?&#8221; asked Grandpa. &#8220;How does praying help?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because he knew that God would take care of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, prayer is our way to talk to God, just like friends like to tell each other everything,&#8221; said Grandpa. He picked up his Bible. &#8220;And this is the way God often talks to us. If we love God we will want to please Him, and the Bible tells us how.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like being kind and cheerful?&#8221; asked Sammy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, to be cheerful even if others leave you out. Remember, God is always there and will never leave you. He is a Friend that sticks closer than a brother.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Something You Can Do</h2>
<p>Want to learn another &#8220;weed secret&#8221;? There are some weeds we use in the kitchen to season food! One of those kinds are called <i>dillweed</i> and can you guess how it is used? Did you guess dill pickles? Yes, that is right. For a fun project this month you can make some in your own kitchen&#8212;with some help, of course. This recipe is healthy for you because it doesn&#8217;t have any vinegar (which will rot in your stomach!).</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_20/something_ingredients.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="140" /></div>
<h1>Lemon Pickles</h1>

<p>For each quart jar you will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>about 1 lb. <b>pickling (small) cucumbers</b></li>

<li>1 <b>garlic clove</b></li>

<li>1 <b>dillweed</b> head or 3 T. dry seeds</li>

<li>1 T. <b>salt</b></li>

<li>1/3 c. <b>lemon</b> <i>or</i> <b>lime juice</b></li>

</ul>
<p>Have ready:</p>

<ul>
<li>a water bath canner</li>
<li>measuring cups and spoons</li>

<li>clean canning jars and lids</li>

</ul>
<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_20/something_pickles.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="131" /></div>
<ol>
<li>First scrub the cucumbers and decide how many jars you will need. Use the quart or half gallon sizes that have wide tops. To kill any germs, someone can help you put them in the oven (on the lowest heat) for 10 minutes.</li>

<li>Fill the canner half full with hot water. Put it on high heat to boil.</li>

<li>With oven mitts set the hot jars on the counter or a chopping board. Be careful!</li>

<li>Time to pack pickles! Measure and pour the salt and lemon juice into each jar. When the jars have cooled a little, put in the dill, garlic, and cucumbers. If you tilt the jar, you can pack the cucumbers standing up.</li>

<li>Next use a dipper to slowly pour boiling water over the cucumbers. Fill each jar to the &#8220;neck&#8221;&#8212;where it gets skinny. All the cucumbers should be covered.</li>

<li>Put your canning lids into the rest of the hot water to boil for 5 minutes. The heat kills any germs that might spoil the pickles. (Use tongs or a magnet to get them out.)</li>

<li>Wipe the jar tops. Set the hot lids on, and screw on the canning rings. Be careful!</li>

<li>With Mom&#8217;s help, put the jars in the canner. Fill it up with hot water until it covers the jars one inch. (If you have a steam canner, set the jars on the rack and just put an inch of water in the bottom to steam them.) Boil the jars for 10 minutes and then let them cool slowly on a dish towel.</li>

<li>If the lids are sealed down tight, they are sealed and ready to store&#8212;or give as a gift! If they do not seal, keep them in the fridge. Wait a month for them to &#8220;pickle&#8221; before opening.</li>

<h1>King Saul&#8217;s Job</h1>

<p>Samuel was reading his Bible and praying. God spoke to him in his heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Samuel,&#8221; God said, &#8220;I want you to tell King Saul to do a job for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Samuel felt bad when he heard this. King Saul was not living right any more. Sometimes he did well, but usually he did not. And he would get angry when he did not like the job. Samuel wished that King Saul would just obey God all the time.</p>

<p>God explained what the job was. King Saul was to destroy <i>all</i> the cows, sheep, and camels in a certain place. Not a single one was to be kept.</p>

<p>Samuel thought about how he used to sweep the floor when he was a boy. It was very important to sweep <i>all</i> the floor&#8212;not just part of it. God wanted the job to be done right.</p>

<p>So Samuel went and told King Saul about the job.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, boy!&#8221; King Saul said, &#8220;This is just great!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember,&#8221; said Samuel, &#8220;you must destroy <i>all</i> the cattle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said King Saul, &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it. No problem!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God won&#8217;t like it if you don&#8217;t obey,&#8221; Samuel warned, &#8220;You had better do it just like God says.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir!&#8221; King Saul said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry! I love to obey.&#8221;</p>

<p>King Saul gathered his men together to do the job. After a lot of hard work, all the cattle were gathered into a large pen.</p>

<p>One of King Saul&#8217;s men came to him and said, &#8220;Sir, these are very fine cattle. In fact, they are some of the nicest cattle I have ever seen.&#8221; He paused, and King Saul could see how dirty and tired he was. &#8220;Sir, would it be all right if we took some home&#8230;&#8203;and sacrificed them to God?&#8221;</p>

<p>King Saul thought about it. If they burnt the cattle at home on the altar as a sacrifice to God, then they would be destroyed, wouldn&#8217;t they? Samuel hadn&#8217;t said just <i>how</i> the cattle were to be destroyed, now did he?</p>

<p>Just then, a little voice spoke up in King Saul. The voice said, &#8220;God doesn&#8217;t want these cattle coming home. He wants them <i>destroyed</i> so they won&#8217;t come home. You are supposed to do <i>just what God says to do, without changing it at all</i>!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Everybody at home was really impressed with what fine, big cattle King Saul and his men had caught. They were even more impressed when they learned that all these cattle were to be sacrificed to the Lord.</p>

<p>Just then, King Saul saw Samuel coming down the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Samuel,&#8221; King Saul called, &#8220;look at how God has blessed us. I obeyed God and did it just as you said He wanted it done!&#8221;</p>

<p>Samuel stopped and looked King Saul right in the eye. &#8220;If you have obeyed God <i>just as He told you to do</i>, then what is all this mooing and baaing that I hear?&#8221; He sighed. &#8220;Saul, God doesn&#8217;t like it. He doesn&#8217;t want sacrifices. He would rather have obedience.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Behold, <i>to obey is better than sacrifice</i>, and to hearken than the fat of rams.

<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear girls,</p>

<p>After listening to so many stories about Princess Precious, I think you might be curious to know how she became a princess in the first place. For you see, every single princess in the King&#8217;s castle is adopted. So it was that Precious once lived outside the palace gates&#8230;.</p>

<p>Her name was Wretched then, for she was hardly ever happy. If you had seen her then, you would not have recognized the sad face of the dirty girl. She played in alley ways and dump heaps, where everyone lived to have their own way. The village of Sin was quite a horrible place!</p>

<p>It was one sunny day when Wretched went out to gather thistle flowers that she first saw the King&#8217;s carriage. As she stared at the beautiful horses a voice said, &#8220;Oh, look at that poor, dirty girl!&#8221;</p>

<p>Wretched looked down, embarrassed, but a smiling girl stepped out of the carriage handed her a basket. &#8220;My name is Princess Hope,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I have brought you a gift.&#8221; As Wretched watched her ride away she thought, <i>If only I was a princess and rode in that carriage, I would be smiling, too.</i></p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_20/letter_wretched.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="156" /></div>
<p>The basket held a book, a ball of soap, and some grapes. In the book Wretched found beautiful pictures of a palace and flowers she had never seen before. Next she smelled the soap and ate the grapes, then started walking home. It was only a dark room with an old straw mat, and Wretched shared it with three other street children, called Selfish, Hateful, and Tears. Wretched didn&#8217;t want them to see her gifts, so she hid the basket in a bush. But all that week she couldn&#8217;t forget the kind princess and she wished she would come again.</p>

<p>And she did. This time Princess Hope invited her into the carriage, but Wretched said nervously, &#8220;I can&#8217;t. My clothes are just terrible.&#8221;</p>

<p>The princess only smiled. &#8220;Papa is the King and has plenty of good clean ones. He wants you to come up to the palace so He can talk with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then Hateful came and whispered, &#8220;Don&#8217;t go! The King shuts children up in His castle and makes them into slaves!&#8221; Wretched gave a little shutter and turned quickly away from the carriage and the kind princess.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have space to tell you all that happened in the next weeks, but it was true that Wretched was more miserable than ever. Home was full of angry voices, and the streets didn&#8217;t seem interesting anymore. The carriage often passed the village, and several times Hope or some of the other princesses talked with her. It was in this way that Wretched finally decided she <i>would</i> take the trip to the King&#8217;s Palace.</p>

<p>As they passed through the gates into the bright gardens Wretched became terribly afraid. &#8220;If the King sees me, He will surely toss me out!&#8221; she said to Princess Desire, who sat beside her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely not, for He has given you a special invitation,&#8221; Desire said, and gave Wretched such a loving hug that she burst into tears. &#8220;Come, He is waiting to meet you,&#8221; Hope said, and they helped the poor, ragged child to the entrance way.</p>

<p>So Wretched walked into the King&#8217;s courtroom, and knelt for the first time before His throne. &#8220;Dear child, I want you to be mine,&#8221; she heard Him say, as He laid a hand upon her head. &#8220;Are you willing to forsake your old home and become My princess?&#8221; Wretched thought about her straw mat and hateful companions, and wished she would never see them again. But how could a poor, ragged girl live here?</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, and I will wash you and give you a royal robe,&#8221; King Jesus said. Wretched looked up at His kind face, and then slipped her little brown hand in His. As He squeezed it tight He said very lovingly, &#8220;And I will call you my Princess Precious.&#8221; So it was that little Wretched was never heard of again, and a new princess came to live in the palace where she was always loved and cared for by the King.</p>

<p>And, dear girls, there is room in that great palace for every one of you, too.</p>

<h1>Dear Reader</h1>

<p>Our Lord is good to all those that trust in Him. We have found this to be true over and over again, and we pray that through these pages others would come to know His faithful care. There is a way to live in <span class="scripture">&#8220;heavenly places in Christ Jesus.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+2%3A6" title="Ephesians 2:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 2:6)</span></a></span></p>

<p>We appreciate hearing from you, so please do write. We welcome questions and would be very happy to hear how the Lord has been helping you. For older levels that want to be challenged and encouraged in Christian living, <i>Foundation Truth</i> is also available for youths and adults.</p>

<p>We are a God-fearing family that includes Rick and Krista Erickson, Laura (21), Skye (20), Joel (20), Kara (17), Erik (16), and Amanda (9). The publishing of <i>Treasures of the Kingdom</i> is mainly done by Laura and Joel, with help (guidance, proofreading, and contributions) from others. We appreciate your prayers, for we certainly can&#8217;t do this without God&#8217;s help!</p>
