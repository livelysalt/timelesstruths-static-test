<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have any friends,&#8221; Sammy complained to Grandpa. &#8220;All the big kids leave me out and say I can&#8217;t come along. I feel sad.&#8221; Grandpa gave him a squeeze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, there is Someone I know that will be your Friend. I&#8217;ll tell you a story about</p>

<h1>Abraham&#8217;s Friend</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+18%3A16-19%3A29">Genesis 18:16-19:29</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Abraham had traveled a long ways from his home. He had come to a strange land where he didn&#8217;t know anyone. Sometimes he must have felt lonely, but he knew of a Friend he could always talk to. It was the Lord God who had called him to Canaan in the first place. And God had promised to never leave him alone. What a good sort of Friend to have!</p>

<p>In the hills of Canaan there weren&#8217;t many people, but Abraham didn&#8217;t mind. He worked hard watching over his great flocks of sheep, herds of cattle, and his many servants. And Abraham always took time to talk to God. It was because he loved the Lord and wanted to please Him that Abraham was called &#8220;The Friend of God.&#8221; Whenever God told him to do something, Abraham was quick to obey. He knew that God always did what was right and good, so Abraham trusted Him.</p>

<p>But the people in the cities below didn&#8217;t love God at all. They were wicked and lived just to please themselves. Abraham didn&#8217;t want to be around them, because if they weren&#8217;t God&#8217;s friends, they couldn&#8217;t be his. But his nephew, Lot, didn&#8217;t feel the same way. I&#8217;m sure Abraham felt sad to see him go live near the city. So he told the Lord God all about it.</p>

<p>Then one day the Lord came and spoke to Abraham. &#8220;Because cities of the plain are so wicked, I will go down and see if they must be destroyed,&#8221; He said. &#8220;Will you destroy the righteous with the wicked?&#8221; Abraham asked. He thought of Lot and his heart was sad. &#8220;What if there are fifty righteous people in the city?&#8221; They talked for a long time as Abraham pled for the city to be saved if there were only a few righteous people. &#8220;If there are only ten, I will save it,&#8221; the Lord said. He loved Abraham and knew what was in his heart. And He knew that there weren&#8217;t even ten people that wanted to live right in that whole city.</p>

<p>It was early the next morning that Abraham went out to look down at the plain. Oh, look! Smoke was billowing high into the sky over the city. What did Abraham think as he watched? He knew his Friend knew all about it and trusted that He had done what was best. He loved God and knew that God would care for Him. And, sure enough, the Lord <i>had</i> remembered Abraham&#8217;s prayer, and had sent Lot out before the city was destroyed.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>&#8220;And the Lord wants to be your Friend, too,&#8221; Grandpa said, when he had finished. Sammy snuggled close and didn&#8217;t say anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;What helped Abraham when he was lonely?&#8221; Grandpa asked after a bit.</p>

<p>&#8220;He prayed to God,&#8221; said Sammy.</p>

<p>&#8220;And why did he do that?&#8221; asked Grandpa. &#8220;How does praying help?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because he knew that God would take care of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, prayer is our way to talk to God, just like friends like to tell each other everything,&#8221; said Grandpa. He picked up his Bible. &#8220;And this is the way God often talks to us. If we love God we will want to please Him, and the Bible tells us how.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like being kind and cheerful?&#8221; asked Sammy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, to be cheerful even if others leave you out. Remember, God is always there and will never leave you. He is a Friend that sticks closer than a brother.&#8221;</p>
