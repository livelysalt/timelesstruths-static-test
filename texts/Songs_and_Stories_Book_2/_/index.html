<h1>Dear Reader</h1>

<p>We are thankful for the opportunity to present another volume of songs and stories. We thank the Lord for the help He has given to make this effort possible, for the encouragement and support of family and friends, and the patience of those who have been waiting on us. To God be all the glory.</p>

<p>As in our first volume, the twelve stories included here have been selected to match the themes in each of the songs. The children&#8217;s songs are reprints from &#8220;Sing unto the Lord,&#8221; published in <i>Treasures of the Kingdom</i>, issues 13-24. Topics such as carefulness, obedience, and diligence are covered, along with experiences in faith and finding the way to God. Some of these are true stories. All of them contain truth that speaks to real needs in our lives, whether we be young or old.</p>

<p>Please don&#8217;t let this little volume sit on the shelf unread. The decades have not lessened the need of good literature, but the best book is useless until it is opened up and &#8220;brought to life.&#8221; Our hearts are burdened with the lack of carefulness and purity in what children are allowed to fill their minds with today. How few recognize that attitudes and thoughts are cultivated just as truly as gardens, and that the proverb still reads, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Be not deceived, God is not mocked, for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+6%3A7" title="Galatians 6:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 6:7)</span></a></span> Oh, please consider the young lives in your care! The good seed is rare and hard to find, but the abundant reaping that comes from the cheap and easy way is truly pain and woe.</p>

<p>Will you share the good seed and cultivate heaven&#8217;s flowers? We pray that this little volume with fulfill the purpose for which it is sent. May the stories and songs filled with timeless truths once again ring out their messages in our homes.</p>

<p class="signature">Our love and prayers,<br />The Editors</p>

<h1>Take Heed</h1>

<p class="author">Isabella M. Alden</p>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">Another chapter in the life of Tip Lewis. He has determined to follow the Path of Life, but can he live down his reputation as the worst boy in town?</p>
</div>


<hr class="minor" />
<p>&#8220;Here, Tip!&#8221; said Howard Minturn; &#8220;hold this frame steady while I try that nail. Will, don&#8217;t put that one up so high, it ain&#8217;t even with the others. Hold on, Ellis&#8212;catch hold of this stool, it&#8217;s tipping. There, now, it&#8217;s all nice and in order&#8212;isn&#8217;t it, Mr. Burrows?&#8221; And he sprang from his stool, as their teacher entered the schoolroom door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very likely,&#8221; answered Mr. Burrows, smiling; &#8220;only I didn&#8217;t hear what you said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say we&#8217;re ready for examination, room and all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The room is, certainly; and I hope your brains are. Ellis, I&#8217;d move that chair a little to the left; it will be in the way of the classes as it stands now. Do you feel brave today, Edward?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; answered Tip promptly, &#8220;pretty brave.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he did, besides feeling eager and excited. The long winter term was over; today and tomorrow were to be days of examination. The boys had been working hard for it&#8212;none harder than had Tip. It was the first examination which had ever come to him in this exciting way. Always before he had been among the few inevitable dunces, running away from examination altogether, or else laughing good-naturedly over his own blundering ignorance. But today it was different: he stood there on the stage among the workers, proudly answering his teacher&#8217;s questions. He looked over at the group of idlers who loitered near the windows&#8212;Bob Turner at their head&#8212;and wondered that he could ever have been of their number.</p>

<p>This was going to be a great day for Tip. It is true he was far behind some others of his age, so far behind that the advanced classes of Howard Minturn and Ellis Holbrook would not even be examined until the next day&#8212;while all of his came that morning. But then Tip knew there was change enough in him to call the attention of everyone present. He felt the change in himself. His mother felt it, when she had that morning brushed his hair for him, and fastened a clean collar on his jacket. And the boys in school felt it. He had taken his place among the workers.</p>

<p>The bell rang at last, and the scholars filed in and took their places. There were visitors, even in the early morning; the people liked to attend Mr. Burrows&#8217; examinations. Tip&#8217;s class in reading came first on the list, and never had his eyes been so bright or his face so eager. Tip had learned to read. Patiently, earnestly, he had plodded on through the long winter; now his sad blunderings in that line were over for ever; not a boy in school read more slowly, distinctly, and correctly than Tip Lewis. The selections were to be made by the committee, immediately after class, of those who were considered ready to enter the history class on the following term. This was the highest reading class in the school: and Tip&#8217;s eyes fairly danced when Mr. Holbrook, who was chairman of the committee, out of a class of thirteen read but two names&#8212;&#8220;Thomas Jones&#8221; and &#8220;Edward Lewis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hallo, Tip!&#8221; Howard Minturn had said to him at recess. &#8220;Let&#8217;s shake hands. Welcome to history; it&#8217;s awfully hard and interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Tip did shake hands, and laughed; and looked over at the other group&#8212;the dunces&#8212;with a half-patronizing nod to Bob Turner; and wondered how he could have borne it if he had been numbered with them that day. He felt that he was climbing towards the top, and climbing <i>fast</i>.</p>

<p>In spelling, too, he came off conqueror. He spelled down the class, spelled until Mr. Burrows closed his book with the words, &#8220;I presume you are tired of this, gentlemen, and, as our examinations are confined to the lessons, I think it will hardly pay to go further, for Edward has not missed any since the second week in the term.&#8221;</p>

<p>So again, flushed and excited, Tip went to his seat victorious. Only arithmetic now, and he would be through with the working part of the day. It was the last recitation in the morning, and he was so eager and anxious to do well, that he began to grow nervous.</p>

<p>The class was called at last. They had gone slowly and carefully through long division, and would be ready for fractions next term. The recitation passed off finely. Tip had not studied day and night during the winter for nothing. He was at the board, working an example in long division; it was almost finished. The hand of the clock pointed to ten minutes of twelve. In ten minutes he would be through, and his name would stand on that honored list, among those who had not missed one word or made one mistake during the examination. His hand began to tremble. What was the matter with that example? Oh, what was the matter? The remainder was too large; no&#8212;it was too small; no&#8212;it was&#8212;he didn&#8217;t know what! Everybody was watching him; he heard a boy laugh softly. He <i>had</i> made a mistake, then&#8212;what was it? Where was it?</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/13_examination.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="258" /></div>
<p>Mr. Burrows&#8217; voice came to him, calm and kind: &#8220;Edward, don&#8217;t get excited. Look at your remainder closely. Take the first figures of divisor and remainder&#8212;nine in thirty-one, how many times? That will help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ellis Holbrook stood but a step from the blackboard, just behind him. Tip heard his low whisper, &#8220;Seven,&#8221; and, without waiting to think&#8212;indeed, he was too nervous to think&#8212;he caught at the number.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seven times!&#8221; he said hurriedly.</p>

<p>Then he heard bursts of laughter from the boys, and dashed down his chalk in an agony of shame and pain. And the clock struck twelve!</p>

<p>The honor was lost.</p>

<p>The boys gathered around him after school was closed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was too bad, Tip,&#8221; Howard Minturn said, in a tone of honest sympathy. &#8220;You&#8217;d have had it in a minute more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have had it if it had not been for Ellis Holbrook, and he&#8217;s a mean scamp!&#8221; Tip answered, in a rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; said Will Bailey; &#8220;what did Ellis do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hearing his name, Ellis turned and proudly confronted the angry boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;He told me wrong just on purpose,&#8221; said Tip. &#8220;That&#8217;s what he did, and he knows it.&#8221; And he broke away from them, and dashed out of the room.</p>

<p>Howard Minturn stood aghast! He could not believe that Ellis Holbrook, his best friend, and the very pink of honor among the boys, should do so mean a thing. And yet it was hard to think that Tip had not told the truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does he mean, Ellis?&#8221; he asked at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to ask him if you want to find out,&#8221; said Ellis haughtily. &#8220;He knows better than anybody else what he means, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently the boys started homeward in a body. Bob Turner and his friends surrounded Tip, and Bob, who never lost a good opportunity for teasing, commenced at once:</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor little fellow, missed his lesson, so he did. Don&#8217;t him cry; him shall have a penny to buy a multiplication table with.&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/13_boys.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="369" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Hold your tongue!&#8221; answered Tip. He was too angry to see how foolish it was to let such words provoke him, seeing they came from a boy who didn&#8217;t know a single <i>line</i> of the multiplication table.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Such</i> a pity!&#8221; began Bob again; &#8220;when it had spelled its lesson all so nice, and had its face washed and its hair combed so pretty. Mustn&#8217;t cry now, to spoil its face. Poor little fellow!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tip turned to his tormentor a face perfectly white with rage, and the boys hardly knew his voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob Turner, if you say another word, I&#8217;ll knock you down and thrash you within an inch of your life. I will&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>Oh, Tip Lewis! God forgive you for the way in which you in your blind rage have finished that sentence&#8212;for the use which you have made of that great Name, which above all others you profess to reverence and fear!</p>

<p>The awful word, once spoken, recalled him to himself. He clapped both hands over his face and ran wildly up the hill, then down out of sight.</p>

<p>The boys had all heard it. Howard, Ellis, Will Bailey, and a half-dozen others, were just behind him.</p>

<p>Ellis Holbrook&#8217;s pride rose high. &#8220;There&#8217;s your wonderful boy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;who was so changed, and has taken it upon himself to preach so many sermons to me. I&#8217;m sure <i>I</i> never finished any of my angry speeches with an oath, if I <i>am</i> so far below him.&#8221;</p>

<p>What an afternoon that was to Tip! He will never forget it. He went no farther than the great tree, which was budding out in spring green. Down he sat on a stone, and once more covered his face with his hands, and such a storm of rage and pain swept over him as he had never known before.</p>

<p>How could he, how <i>could</i> he have said that word?</p>

<p>Ever since he had learned to pray, he had been afraid of that sin. He had been afraid he might forget, and go back to his old habits, and so he had watched and guarded his lips with such care and prayer. But lately he had given up all fear. It had been such a long time, and he had never once fallen, so he felt sure that he never would again.</p>

<p>He had felt so sure and proud and strong, that he had asked no help from God that day. He had been so eager to spend every moment on his arithmetic, that he had found no time to go to his Bible for strength. No wonder&#8212;oh, no wonder that he fell! He had been standing too firmly in his own strength, feeling no need of help. Now, what should he do? How low he felt, how mean! Could God forgive him? Yes, He could.</p>

<p>Tip felt in his soul that there was nothing which God could <i>not</i> do, and yet he felt too mean and fallen to dare to ask Him for anything more. He forgot for the moment that Jesus Christ died to save <i>sinners</i>.</p>

<p>The sun went on over his head, and commenced his afternoon work. Then there came up the hill the sound of the school bell, but Tip took no notice of that; he didn&#8217;t want to <i>think</i> of school, much less even go.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/13_reading.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="287" /></div>
<p>Presently he began to fumble for his Bible&#8212;he must have some help. It opened of itself at the Psalms, and he read the first line which he saw: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Unto Thee, O God, do we give thanks&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+75%3A1" title="Psalm 75:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 75:1)</span></a></span>&#8212;No, not that, and he turned back a couple of leaves. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Make a joyful noise&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+66%3A1" title="Psalm 66:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 66:1)</span></a></span>&#8212;No, no! He didn&#8217;t want to hear anything about joy; his heart was as heavy as lead. So he turned over several leaves at once. He must find something that would read as if it meant him. <span class="scripture">&#8220;O L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+38%3A1" title="Psalm 38:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 38:1)</span></a></span> Oh, that was it! God was very angry with him&#8212;had a right to be&#8212;this was just what he ought to say. He read on through the psalm; almost every verse seemed for him, and when he read the one next to the last&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;Forsake me not, O L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>: O my God, be not far from me&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+38%3A21" title="Psalm 38:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 38:21)</span></a></span>&#8212;he said it over and over, and finally, in a great burst of tears, got down and said it on his knees.</p>

<p>The short spring day was over, and the chilly night was setting in. Tip had reached home finally, had split the wood for the next day, done whatever he could find to do about the house, and then carried to the clothing store the vests which his mother had just finished. He went away around behind the mill so as to avoid passing the schoolhouse, lest he might chance to see some of the boys. Then he came home, ate his supper in silence, and went up to his attic. He felt better than he had at noon, but his heart was still heavy, and he dreaded the next day, not knowing what he ought to do, or how to do it.</p>

<p>This was Thursday evening, but he didn&#8217;t mean to go to prayer meeting. Kitty had asked him, had even coaxed a little, but he said, &#8220;No, not tonight.&#8221; He felt stiff and sore from his long sitting under the great tree in the early spring dampness. He told himself that this was the reason why he was not going to prayer meeting. But the real reason was that he felt as if he could not possibly face Mr. Burrows that evening, and certainly not Mr. Holbrook&#8212;of course, Ellis had told him all about it.</p>

<p>Tip felt very tired, and his head and limbs ached. He was going to read a chapter in his Bible and go to bed. He chose the same psalm which had come to him with so much power that afternoon, read it slowly and carefully, then knelt down to pray, and as he did so a new trouble loomed up before him. What should he do? He had prayed for Ellis Holbrook and Bob Turner ever since he began to pray for himself, but he felt as though he could not possibly pray for either of them tonight. Both had tried to injure him; both had succeeded. He wished them no harm: he didn&#8217;t want to choke or drown them, as he had felt like doing at noon, but clearly he didn&#8217;t want to pray for them. He had arisen from his knees, and was sitting on the edge of the box which was his table and chair, with a very troubled face. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that he could not pray for those boys just then. At last he thought he had found a way out of the difficulty. He said to himself that he was very tired, almost sick; he would just repeat the Lord&#8217;s Prayer and go to bed. In the morning, very likely, he should feel differently; he almost knew he should. So he knelt down once more.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Our Father which art in heaven,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+6%3A9" title="Matthew 6:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 6:9)</span></a></span> he began, and slowly, reverently, repeated the sweet petition, until he came to <span class="scripture">&#8220;forgive us our debts as we&#8212;&#8221;</span> There he stopped. He understood that prayer. They had been studying it in Sunday school, a sentence at a time, and talking about it, and only the Sunday before last that sentence had been explained. Tonight Tip could not finish it; there was no getting around the fact that he had not forgiven either Ellis or Bob. Once more he got up, and took a seat on the edge of his bed to think. He was never so perplexed in his life. What ought he to do? Couldn&#8217;t he pray at all? Mr. Holbrook had said he must never mock God by asking for what he did not mean. And to say those words, &#8220;as we forgive our debtors,&#8221; feeling as he did tonight, would be mocking God. He ought not to feel so, but how could he help it? Suddenly, with a little sigh of relief, he went down on his knees again. He had thought of something which he <i>could</i> say. &#8220;Oh, Jesus, make me feel like praying for Bob and Ellis; make me want them to be Christians as hard as I did last night; make me feel like forgiving them.&#8221; Then there was silence in the lonely attic, while Tip, still on his knees, struggled with the evil spirit within him. He came off conqueror, for presently he added, &#8220;Oh, dear Jesus, I&#8217;ll forgive them both!&#8221; And then he finished the prayer&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+6%3A12" title="Matthew 6:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 6:12)</span></a></span></p>

<p>While he went around after that, making ready for rest and sleep, the <span class="scripture">&#8220;peace of God, which passeth all understanding&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+4%3A7" title="Philippians 4:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 4:7)</span></a></span> came down and settled in his heart. Presently he seemed to come to another difficulty, for he sat down with one boot in his hand and one still on his foot. This question, however, was settled promptly: he pulled the boot on again in a hurry, then picked up his jacket and put that on, seized his hat, and ran downstairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kitty,&#8221; he said, putting his head in at the kitchen door, &#8220;I&#8217;m going, after all; come on.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Kitty joyfully ran for her hood and shawl.</p>

<p>But Tip did not open his lips in prayer meeting that evening. He felt bowed down to the very ground with shame. He did not once raise his eyes to the seat where Howard Minturn, Will Bailey, and others of the schoolboys were sitting. And, when the short hour was gone, he made haste to get out from Mr. Holbrook&#8217;s sight and the sound of his voice. But he had much reason, after that, to thank God that he did not succeed.</p>

<p>He had just got from under the gaze of the hall lamp, and stood a minute in the darkness waiting for Kitty, when he felt Mr. Holbrook&#8217;s hand on his arm, and heard his kind, quiet voice: &#8220;Edward, Mrs. Holbrook has some little business to transact with Kitty tonight. Shall I walk with you?&#8221; And so Tip, seeing there was no help for it, walked by his side.</p>

<p>The minister said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t see you at school this afternoon: how was that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Holbrook, didn&#8217;t Ellis tell you about it this noon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ellis has told me nothing. I heard, from one of the smaller boys, a very sad story. Have you anything to tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, I have not; it&#8217;s all true. I got awful mad, and I said mad things. I&#8212;I did worse than that.&#8221; Tip&#8217;s voice had sunk to a solemn whisper.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/13_talking.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="153" /></div>
<p>Mr. Holbrook, too, was silent and sad. At last he said, &#8220;What, Edward! Do you mean to give up, and go back to the old life?&#8221; And years later he would remember just how painfully his heart throbbed while he waited for Tip&#8217;s answer.</p>

<p>It was prompt and plain: &#8220;No, sir; God wouldn&#8217;t even let me do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then for a minute Mr. Holbrook did not speak for very thankfulness that, through all this maze of sin, God was leading Tip into the light again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you feel that you have God&#8217;s forgiveness?&#8221; he asked, speaking gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221; Tip could not give very long answers that evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why were you so quiet tonight in prayer meeting?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said Tip, speaking low, &#8220;I was ashamed to say anything before you or Mr. Burrows or the boys, after what happened today.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More ashamed with us than you were with God?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, I was; because God knows all about it&#8212;just how sorry I am, and how He has forgiven me, and is going to help me. But you didn&#8217;t know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Mr. Holbrook was thankful.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about tomorrow, Edward?&#8221; he asked at last.</p>

<p>And this time Tip&#8217;s answer was very low: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know; I don&#8217;t know what to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you knew what was right to do, would you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;d try to, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, did you honor or dishonor Christ today?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tip&#8217;s answer was in a more timid tone than he often spoke: &#8220;I dishonored Him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do the boys know that you are very sorry, and have asked God to forgive you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir; they don&#8217;t know anything about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think, for the honor of Christ, they ought to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who ought to tell them?&#8221;</p>

<p>No immediate answer came to this; then, after a little, &#8220;Mr. Holbrook, how could I tell them&#8212;to each one&#8212;about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See if you cannot answer your own question. Will not all the boys be likely to hear about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; they&#8217;ll be sure to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And would they all be likely to hear what you have to say, unless you spoke to all at once?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Holbrook, if I did that, it would have to be in school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But tomorrow is the last day, and it&#8217;s examination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>That short word seemed to have a good deal of power over Tip. For, after a long silence, he only answered it by saying, &#8220;Mr. Holbrook, do you know how very hard that would be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Edward, do you know how very hard it was for your Savior to listen to your words this noon?&#8221;</p>

<p>And Mr. Holbrook heard no more from Tip, save, when they reached the corner, a very low, very grave, &#8220;Good night.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were not many visitors in the next morning. It was too early, as yet, for any but the examining committee, and a few very fond, very anxious mothers. Mr. Burrows&#8217; hand was on the bell. In a few moments the algebra class would be in full tide of recitation. Ellis and Howard had their slates in their hands, ready to start at the first sound, when Tip Lewis left his seat and made his way towards the stage. Mr. Burrows looked surprised; this was entirely out of order. But a look at Tip&#8217;s face made him change his mind about sending him back to his seat, and he bent his head to listen to the few words that were hurriedly whispered in his ear. Then he looked even more surprised. He hesitated a moment, then asked, &#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you better wait until noon, and I can detain the scholars a few moments?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Tip, shaking his head, and speaking earnestly. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid, if I wait till noon, I shan&#8217;t do it at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; Mr. Burrows answered finally. &#8220;Scholars, one of your number tells me that he has something of importance to say to you. We will wait and hear him.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was well for Tip that he was a bold boy, that every day of his life had been such as to teach him a lesson of boldness, else his courage would surely have failed him, when he felt the many curious eyes resting on him. As it was, his face was scarlet, when he turned it away from the desk and towards the boys. Yet he spoke promptly, as he always did when he spoke at all:</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to tell the boys that I am sorry for yesterday. I suppose they all know what I did. I got awful mad, and I&#8212;I said a dreadful word. I didn&#8217;t think I would ever be so wicked again. I feel awful about it. But I don&#8217;t want the boys to think that I don&#8217;t love Jesus anymore, because I do. And He is going to help me try.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such a silence as was in that schoolroom then the boys had never felt before!</p>

<p>Mr. Burrows&#8217; face was shaded with his hand. He let the silence rest upon them for a moment, after Tip had taken his seat. Then he spoke, low and solemnly, &#8220;Boys, what God has forgiven, I feel sure that no scholar of mine will be mean enough ever to mention again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the bell sounded, and the business of the day went on. Tip had laid his head down on the desk the minute he took his seat, and he kept it there throughout the recitation. He had been through a fearful struggle. It was hard work for a boy like him to stand up before the school and tell them how he had fallen. But it was over now, and from his very soul he felt that he had done right.</p>

<p>Bob Turner, sitting beside him, was quiet and sober. And when Tip raised his arm with such a sudden jerk that he knocked his arithmetic to the floor, Bob leaned over and quietly picked it up and laid it back in its place. This was quite an amazing thing for Bob Turner to do.</p>

<p>At noon the boys gathered around Tip, quiet and kind. No one spoke of what had been the important event of the morning&#8212;all were on good behavior.</p>

<p>Ellis Holbrook came into their midst.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tip,&#8221; he said, speaking gravely, yet very coldly, &#8220;perhaps it would be as well for you to know that you made quite a blunder yesterday, when you said I told you wrong. I hadn&#8217;t the slightest notion of telling you, right <i>or</i> wrong. But I know how you came to think so. I was looking up a word in Mr. Burrows&#8217; dictionary, and stood just behind you, when Mr. Bailey leaned over and asked me how many there were in your class when all were present, and I answered him, &#8216;Seven.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<p>Tip looked perfectly astonished. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you say so yesterday?&#8221; he asked at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you didn&#8217;t give me a chance,&#8221; Ellis answered coolly. &#8220;I&#8217;m not in the habit of cheating, nor of being told that I do, so I was not prepared with an answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; said Tip, after a minute, answering the first part of Ellis&#8217;s sentence. &#8220;That&#8217;s true, I didn&#8217;t. I was mad, and I just banged off before anybody could say anything. I might have known you didn&#8217;t do any such thing. It ain&#8217;t like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Tip walked away, leaving Ellis to think that the boy who was so far below him had shown much the better spirit of the two.</p>

<p>The busy day was drawing to a close. The last recitation was over, and the boys were in a state of grand excitement, waiting to hear the report of the committee. They were waiting to know whose names were to stand on the Roll of Honor, having passed through the entire examination without a mistake.</p>

<p>Poor Tip was sad. Yesterday morning he had felt so sure that his name would have an honorable place, and to him it was so much more exciting, because it would be for the first time. How hard he had worked. And now it was all lost! Stupidly lost, too, he said to himself, over an example that he had done a dozen times.</p>

<p>He drew a heavy sigh, and roused himself to listen. Mr. Burrows had already called for the report, and Mr. Holbrook, as chairman of the committee, had arisen. But, instead of reading the report, he said, &#8220;Mr. Burrows, if there is time, I should like to say a few words to the scholars. Boys, you were all listeners to Edward Lewis&#8217;s examination yesterday, and I presume you know better than I do how hard he has worked. Now, I think anyone who watched him yesterday could have seen that, if he hadn&#8217;t gotten so excited and nervous, he could have worked that example. Mr. Burrows, may I put a question to vote?&#8221;</p>

<p>And as Mr. Burrows gave a hearty consent, he continued: &#8220;Very well. Now, whoever is willing to allow Edward Lewis to go to the board now and try that example, and, if he succeeds, give him the place which would have been his yesterday, please stand up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ellis Holbrook was the first to spring to his feet, and every single boy in the room followed his example. Tip alone sat still, with burning cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well done,&#8221; said Mr. Holbrook. &#8220;Now it only remains to get your teacher&#8217;s consent to our plan.&#8221;</p>

<p>Which Mr. Burrows gave by wheeling his table from before the blackboard and picking up an arithmetic. &#8220;You may come forward, Edward. I will dictate the example. Which one is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The thirty-ninth, sir; fifty-first page.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time Tip was at the board. How they watched him! How fearful his teacher was for him! How he longed to have him succeed! Tip worked fast and boldly. His hand did not tremble. The chalk and fingers and brain did their duty. The terrible &#8220;nine in thirty-one, how many times,&#8221; as a test for the larger number, was reached, and an unusually large and bold figure <i>three</i> was placed in the quotient. A few more rapid dashes, and then, with a grand flourish after the &#8220;seventeen remainder,&#8221; Tip threw down the chalk, pushed back the hair from his hot temples, and walked to his seat. The boys could not keep quiet any longer: a very soft tapping was heard at first, then, finding they were not silenced, it rose to a loud, decided stamping of many feet. But Mr. Holbrook was on his feet again, and they were quiet directly, for the report was finally to be read.</p>

<p>&#8220;My son,&#8221; said Mr. Holbrook, not long after, laying his hand kindly on Ellis&#8217;s shoulder, as he was hurrying from the room, &#8220;what do you think of Edward&#8217;s religion tonight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it is honest, sir,&#8221; Ellis answered quickly. &#8220;Excuse me, Father, if you please; I must see Howard a minute before he goes.&#8221; And so he ran away from his father&#8217;s longing look.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/13_paper.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="303" /></div>
<p>As for Tip, he borrowed from Howard Minturn a copy of the village paper, which came out a few days after, and read the report of the examination. There he read this sentence: &#8220;And, among all the pupils, perhaps no one of them has made more rapid or astonishing progress than has Edward Lewis.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, while the twilight deepened, he turned eagerly to the next column, which read in this way:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noindent first">ROLL OF HONOR</p>

<p>Being an alphabetically arranged list of those who passed the entire Examination without making an error:</p>

<p class="noindent">WILLARD BAILEY<br />ELLIS HOLBROOK<br />HARVEY JENNINGS<br />EDWARD LEWIS</p>

</blockquote>

<h1>Amy&#8217;s Holiday</h1>

<p class="author">Author Unknown</p>

<p>One Friday, at noon, a room full of schoolgirls had put away their books, and sat waiting to be dismissed. Amy, a tanned little girl, was in a great hurry to be free. She had one foot out in the aisle, and her hand was on her desk, all ready to spring from her seat as soon as the signal was given.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now children, I&#8217;m inviting you all to come back to school this afternoon,&#8221; said the teacher. &#8220;Since you usually have Friday afternoons off, you don&#8217;t have to come if you don&#8217;t want to. But I shall be here at two, and hope to find a few of my scholars, at least; those who love me, and love school.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were many blank faces at this. All wanted the holiday. The industrious scholars were tired, and needed the usual rest. Those who found it tiresome to labor, and loved to be in the open air, like Amy, were eager to be set free for a long afternoon. Some of the older girls smiled, and nodded to each other. The teacher almost laughed out at the vexation of Amy, who pouted, and looked cross. When anyone turned towards her with a questioning look, as if to say, &#8220;Are you coming, Amy?&#8221; she shook her head with a frown, as if to say, &#8220;Indeed, I shall not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are dismissed,&#8221; said the teacher.</p>

<p>Amy scampered off in such haste that she left her bag. Some of the girls stayed behind and begged to know why there was to be school.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is my secret,&#8221; said the teacher, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do we have to come?&#8221; they asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t have to. I would be happy if you did come. And I think you will enjoy it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so all the students came. Everyone, that is, but Amy. About the middle of the afternoon there was a knock at the schoolroom door. The teacher&#8217;s voice called out, &#8220;Who is it? Is that you, Amy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; she said through the door. &#8220;I want my bag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Then you have not come to school?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am&#8212;it is already past three o&#8217;clock!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you will change your mind, you may come in, now! I will not note you as tardy.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the girls opened the door a crack and peeped out mischievously at Amy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have company waiting for me,&#8221; said Amy. &#8220;I cannot change my mind. Besides it is pleasanter out of doors, this warm afternoon. So do get my bag, Anna, and let me go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Anna, &#8220;go back farther from the door, so that you cannot look in, and you shall have your bag, little goose!&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/14_school.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="267" /></div>
<p>Amy wanted to know what was going on that she was wasn&#8217;t allowed to look at, and had half a mind to go in to school, anyway. But the idea of being prisoner for the rest of the afternoon, and the jingling of some coins in her bag, turned her feet from the door. As she went away, she heard a loud laugh, and a murmur of merry voices. She stopped, and half turned round. &#8220;I wish I had gone in,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;but I am ashamed to do it now. They would all have such a laugh, to see me, after all. No, I&#8217;ll go&#8230;&#8203;I&#8217;ll buy some nuts.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/14_walking1.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="219" /></div>
<p>A ragged, impudent looking girl, a head taller than Amy, was waiting for her in the street. Her name was Lucy Wayland. As she was poor, Amy&#8217;s mother had wished to help her earn something, and so had employed Lucy to do chores about the house now and then. Lately, she had not been allowed to come to the house, for Amy&#8217;s mother had suspected her of stealing some things. Amy did not know this. But she did know that Lucy was not a good girl, and she felt ashamed of her disorderly appearance, as they walked side by side. Though she was taught not to be proud, she knew that her mother would not like to have her spend time with such a companion. She felt very uncomfortable and discontented all the afternoon, though Lucy was full of smiles and flattery, and Amy was glad to have anyone to speak to. The girls she usually played with were all back in the schoolroom.</p>

<p>They cracked the nuts together, and then went off into the woods, where Amy&#8217;s clothes soon became quite as ragged as Lucy&#8217;s, for sadly her dress and socks got torn in many places, as she tried doing the things Lucy did. For the first time in her life Amy climbed a tree. She was a long time perched in the branches, before she could gather courage to get down again. She came to the ground all in a heap, like a bag of sand, while Lucy swung herself about like a monkey.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/14_tree.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="267" /></div>
<p>Amy did not know where she was, and Lucy brought her out of the wood opposite Mrs. Wayland&#8217;s door. &#8220;See, mother,&#8221; she bawled, as a brown cap, with dirty red ribbons, appeared at a window, &#8220;Here&#8217;s the squire&#8217;s daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in, miss, and rest yerself, if you ain&#8217;t too proud to come under a poor person&#8217;s roof,&#8221; said Mrs. Wayland.</p>

<p>&#8220;La, she ain&#8217;t proud a mite,&#8221; said Lucy, leading Amy along. &#8220;She played with me this whole afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amy picked her way over the black, greasy mud to the doorstep. There she slipped, and fell into the arms of the woman, who kissed her two or three times, and carried her into the house.</p>

<p>As Amy looked about the room, she was astonished to see many things which had been missing at home. She recognized at once a pair of scissors, which they had searched all over the house for, some weeks before. A piece of carpet said, &#8220;How do you do, old friend?&#8221; almost as plain as speech. A handkerchief, which lay in the window, had her own name on it. If it hadn&#8217;t been for that, she would never have guessed that it had ever been white. She could hardly help but see these things, but she tried not to seem to be looking at them. Since she had made herself Lucy&#8217;s companion, she felt that she couldn&#8217;t say anything, though she felt rather ashamed of her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wayland gave Lucy some money, and told her to get some things for supper. As Amy waited for her to get back, she began to feel quite uncomfortable, and wished she had stayed at the school after all. But Lucy soon returned, with something rolled up in brown paper, and a bag of crackers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! Couldn&#8217;t ye get no more butter than that for four cents? You needn&#8217;t a got the best kind. Two crackers short! You&#8217;ve eaten &#8217;em, comin&#8217; home, you scamp!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He never gave me another one,&#8221; cried Lucy, angrily. But she whispered to Amy, &#8220;I mean, if lies are true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go home,&#8221; said Amy, half ready to cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t let you stir till after supper,&#8221; said Lucy. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to have cracker toast. I guess you don&#8217;t get anything better than that, at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you eat with poor folks for once?&#8221; said the woman, in a sneering voice. &#8220;Our vittles is clean, if our house ain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amy was very hungry, and having resolved just to taste the crackers, ate so heartily that the last one was toasted before she and Lucy were satisfied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I must go home as fast as I can,&#8221; she cried, seeing that the sun was almost down. &#8220;What will mother think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t tell her where you been,&#8221; says Lucy. &#8220;You can tell her that&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, tell her where ye took supper, and was treated to the best, and no harm come to ye,&#8221; said the woman. &#8220;I suspected you was run away, all the time. You ain&#8217;t so proud yerself, but your mammy would have cut her hand off, rather than set down to eat with me, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I knew the way home,&#8221; said Amy, sighing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucy, go along with her,&#8221; said the old woman.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/14_walking2.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="341" /></div>
<p>And so Amy started for home with Lucy. She imagined that every person who met them was shocked to see her in such company. As she came near home, she found there was quite a hubbub in the neighborhood. Her brothers and sisters had been sent in every direction in search of her. And she was mortified to hear Lucy cry out triumphantly, &#8220;The lost is found, safe and sound. She&#8217;s only been over to our house, takin&#8217; tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amy&#8217;s mother told Lucy she could not hire her anymore, and rebuked her for having been a bad example to Amy, who was several years younger than herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the thanks poor folks get,&#8221; muttered Lucy. &#8220;I&#8217;ve took good care of her, given her a first rate supper, and fetched her home, that&#8217;s all. I never asked her to go along with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Amy!&#8221; said her mother, in a low voice. &#8220;Have you been eating with those who don&#8217;t even have enough for themselves! That is not like you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Amy went sobbing to hide herself in bed. Lucy was sent home, with a load of provisions, and forbidden to come to the house again.</p>

<p>There were many knowing glances at Amy&#8217;s downcast looks and burning cheeks when the family met at breakfast the next morning, but no one said a word to make her more unhappy. Neither did her sisters say anything about what happened in school Friday afternoon. Amy listened when she heard them talking together, hoping to catch a word or two to relieve her curiosity about it, but in vain. Once something was said about &#8220;beautiful feathers,&#8221; but the speaker checked herself, with an air of mystery, looking mischievously at Amy. Monday morning came, and Amy went to school. She did not go with her sisters, as usual, but followed a little way behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Amy. How did you enjoy the afternoon, Friday?&#8221; asked the teacher, as Amy slunk to her seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all. I wish I had been at school, I am sure. I&#8217;ll come next time. Or, I&#8217;ll come next Wednesday, all alone, if you will let me, Miss Eliza. Will you let me come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may come, and welcome, but I shall not be able to show you what the girls saw on Friday. They were not mine, and I had to return them afterward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know what the girls saw. They did not tell me. Did they write, and do math, and draw?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A friend lent me <i>Audubon&#8217;s Birds</i>, and so I decided to let my students see them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Live birds? Perhaps they were stuffed, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, better than that. They were large pictures, not only of the birds themselves, but of the places where they live, and their way of life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The heron wading, and the kingfisher fishing, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One wild scene had a fog over it, looking so natural that one of the girls jumped when I spoke, and said she thought for a moment she was there all alone, among the reeds and bushes, watching the birds who were flying and hopping about there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; groaned Amy, again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was sorry you were not with us,&#8221; said the teacher, &#8220;and I knew you would be very sorry today. Try to love school, and you will love it. I love it, myself, though I get very tired, especially when my little Amy is restless and needs watching.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I will not need watching any more, dear Miss Eliza. I will be just as busy when you are not looking, and get all my lessons very perfectly. I shall be happier, I know, if I am good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed; then you will not think of the schoolroom as a place to be rebuked and punished in. And if you are busy, you will not be watching the clock, and thinking how long the morning is. We busy folks are often quite surprised when the bell rings for lunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so Amy tried being a good girl, and found that she did indeed enjoy it. She loved Miss Eliza with her whole heart, and now no longer cried herself to sleep at night for not having done well in school. She now desired to do well, and she applied herself so that she became worthy of praise.</p>

<h1>Carletta and the Skeptic</h1>

<p class="author">Author Unknown</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could only have your faith, gladly would I believe&#8212;but I was born a skeptic. I cannot believe in God and the future as you do.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/15_walking.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="318" /></div>
<p>John Harvey said this as he walked with a friend under a dripping umbrella. John Harvey had been a skeptic for thirty years and seemed quite firm in his unbelief. Everybody had given him up as hopeless. Reasoning ever so calmly made no impression on the rocky soil of his heart. Alas! it was sad, very sad!</p>

<p>But one friend had never given him up. &#8220;I will talk with and pray for John Harvey until I die,&#8221; Stephen Hawkins had said. &#8220;And I will have faith that he may yet come out of darkness into the marvelous light.&#8221; And whenever Stephen met John, he always talked with him about the truth.</p>

<p>So on that stormy night, as they walked under the umbrella together, he said, &#8220;God can change a skeptic, John. He has more power over your heart than you, and I am still going to pray for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I have no objections, none in the world. Pray all your want&#8212;seeing is believing, you know. I&#8217;m ready for any miracle; but I tell you it would take nothing short of a miracle to convince me. Let&#8217;s change the subject. I&#8217;m hungry and it&#8217;s too far to go up to my house for supper on this stormy night. Here&#8217;s a restaurant: let us eat here.&#8221;</p>

<p>How warm and pleasant it looked in the long, well-lit restaurant.</p>

<p>Stephen and John had just finished eating, and were getting ready to leave, when a strain of soft music came through the open door&#8212;a child&#8217;s sweet voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon my word, that is pretty,&#8221; said John Harvey. &#8220;What purity in those tones!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Out of here, you little baggage!&#8221; cried a hoarse voice, and one of the waiters pointed angrily to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, let her stay,&#8221; called John Harvey.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t allow them in this place, sir,&#8221; said the waiter, &#8220;but she can go into the reading room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. I want to hear her,&#8221; said John.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/15_carletta.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="409" /></div>
<p>All this time they had seen the shadow of something hovering backwards and forwards on the edge of the door. Now they followed a slight little figure, wrapped in a patched cloak, patched hood, and leaving the mark of wet feet as she walked. Curious to see her face&#8212;for she was very small&#8212;John Harvey lead her to the farthest part of the large room, where there were but few gentlemen, and then motioned her to sing. The little one looked timidly up. Her cheek was of olive darkness, but a flush rested there, and out of the thinnest face, surrounded by masses of the blackest hair, looked two eyes, whose softness and tender pleading would have touched the hardest heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;This little thing is sick, I believe,&#8221; said John Harvey, compassionately. &#8220;What do you sing, child?&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sing Italian or a little English.&#8221;</p>

<p>John Harvey looked at her shoes. &#8220;Why,&#8221; he exclaimed, and his lips quivered, &#8220;her feet are wet to her ankles. She will catch her death of cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>The child, folding her thin fingers in front of her, and pushing back her hood, began to sing. Her voice was wonderful. And, simple and common as were both the tune and words, the emotion in her voice caught the attention of several of the businessmen in the room. The little song began:</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;There is a happy land, far, far away.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/There_Is_a_Happy_Land/index.html" title="There Is a Happy Land">*</a></p>

<p>Never could the voice and manner of that child be forgotten. There almost seemed a halo around her head. And when she had finished, she turned her great, expressive eyes toward John Harvey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, child, where did you learn that song?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the Sunday School, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you don&#8217;t suppose there is a happy land?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>know</i> there is. I&#8217;m going to sing there,&#8221; she said, so quickly, so decidedly that the men looked at each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going to sing there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. Mother said so. She used to sing to me until she was very sick. Then she said she wasn&#8217;t going to sing any more on earth, but up in heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8212;and what then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then she died, sir,&#8221; said the child. And tears rolled down the dark cheek, now flushed dangerously scarlet.</p>

<p>John Harvey was silent for a few moments. Presently he said, &#8220;Well, though she died, my little girl, <i>you</i> may live, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, sir! no, sir! I&#8217;d rather go there and be with mother. Sometimes I have a dreadful pain in my side, and cough as she did. There won&#8217;t be any pain up there, sir&#8212;it&#8217;s a beautiful world!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; faltered on the lips of the skeptic.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother told me so, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Words how impressive, manner how childlike, and yet so wise!</p>

<p>John Harvey&#8217;s mother had been a praying mother. He found it hard to breathe for a moment&#8212;he could hardly keep back the sobs he felt inside. And yet he could not look away from those large, soft, trusting eyes of the child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Child, you must have a pair of shoes.&#8221; John Harvey&#8217;s voice was husky.</p>

<p>Hands were thrust in pockets, purses pulled out, and the astonished child held in her little hand more money than she had ever seen before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her father is a poor, feeble street musician,&#8221; whispered one of the men. &#8220;I suppose he&#8217;s too sick to be out tonight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Along the soggy street went the child, now under the protection of John Harvey, but not with shoes that filled with water at every step. Warm and comfortable ones were hers now. Down in the deep, den-like streets of the city walked the man, the little, cold hand of the child in his. At an open door they stopped. Up broken, creaking stairs they climbed. Another doorway was opened, and a wheezing voice called out from the darkness, &#8220;Carletta!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Father! Father! See what I have brought you! Look at me! Look at me!&#8221; The poor girl, dropping the money, fell, crying and laughing together, into the old man&#8217;s arms.</p>

<p><i>Was</i> he a man? A face, dark and hollow, all overgrown with uncombed hair as black as night, a pair of wild eyes, a body bent nearly double, hands like claws.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he give you all this, my child?</p>

<p>&#8220;They all did, Father. Now you shall have soup and oranges.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir&#8212;I&#8217;m sick, you see&#8212;all gone, sir!&#8212;had to send the poor child out, or we&#8217;d starve. God bless you, sir! I wish I was well enough to play you a tune,&#8221; and he looked wistfully towards the corner where the old organ stood, battered and worn.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>One month later Stephen and John met again as if by agreement, and walked slowly downtown. Treading innumerable passages they came to the gloomy building where Carletta&#8217;s father lived.</p>

<p>No&#8212;he did not live there any longer, for as they paused a moment, out came two or three men bearing a pine coffin. In the coffin slept the old street musician.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was very sudden, sir,&#8221; said a woman, who recognized John Harvey. &#8220;Yesterday the little girl took sick and it seemed as if he drooped right away. He died at six last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men went silently upstairs. The room was empty of everything save a bed, a chair, and a nurse, whom John Harvey had hired to take care of them. The child lay there, not white, but pale as marble, with a strange shine on her brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my little one, are you better?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, sir. Father is gone up there and I am going.&#8221;</p>

<p>Up there! John Harvey turned unconsciously towards Stephen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever hear of Jesus?&#8221; Stephen asked the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know who He was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Good</i> Jesus,&#8221; murmured the child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stephen, this breaks me down,&#8221; said John Harvey, and he placed his handkerchief to his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry, don&#8217;t cry. <i>I</i> can&#8217;t cry, I&#8217;m so glad,&#8221; said the child exultingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you glad for, my dear?&#8221; asked Stephen.</p>

<p>&#8220;To get away from <i>here</i>,&#8221; she said promptly. &#8220;I used to be so cold in the winter, for we didn&#8217;t have fire sometimes. But mother used to hug me close and sing about heaven. Mother told me to never mind, and kissed me, and said if I was His, the Savior would love me and one of these days would give me a better home. And so I gave myself to Him, for I wanted a better home. And, oh, I shall sing there and be <i>so</i> happy!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a little sigh she closed her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;John, are faith and hope nothing?&#8221; asked Stephen Hawkins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak to me, Stephen. To be as that little child I would give all I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And to be like her you need give nothing but your stubborn will, your skeptical doubts, and the heart that will never know rest till at the feet of Christ.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>Presently the child&#8217;s hands moved, the arms were raised, the eyes opened. Yet, glazed though they were, they turned still upward. &#8220;See!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Oh, there is mother! And angels! And they are all singing.&#8221; Her voice faltered, but the celestial brightness lingered yet on her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no doubting the soul-triumph there,&#8221; whispered Stephen Hawkins.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is wonderful,&#8221; replied John Harvey, looking on both with awe and tenderness. &#8220;Is she gone?&#8221; He sprang from his chair as if he would detain her.</p>

<p>But the chest and forehead were marble now, the eyes had lost the fire of life. She must have died as she lay looking at them.</p>

<p>&#8220;She was always a sweet little thing,&#8221; said the nurse softly.</p>

<p>John Harvey stood as if spellbound. There was a touch on his arm. He started.</p>

<p>&#8220;John,&#8221; said Stephen, with an affectionate look, &#8220;shall we pray?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a minute there was no answer. Then tears came to John Harvey&#8217;s eyes. The whole body of the softened skeptic shook as he cried out, &#8220;Yes, pray, <i>pray</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>And from the side of the dead child went up agonizing pleadings to the throne of God. And that prayer was answered&#8212;the miracle was wrought&#8212;the lion became a lamb&#8212;the doubter a believer&#8212;the skeptic a Christian!</p>

<h1>The Little Gardener</h1>

<p class="author">Author Unknown</p>

<p>Not many years ago, a man came over from Ireland, and settled in Boston. He was a gardener, and his name was Alex Murphy. He was very poor, but he was very honest. He loved to work in the garden, and nothing pleased him so much as to plant seeds in the ground, and see the plants grow when they came up.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/16_garden.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="170" /></div>
<p>This poor Irishman had lost his wife before he came to Boston. But he had one son, Peter. Peter was a good child, and loved very much to work in the garden with his father. He had a little spade, with which he dug up the ground, and a little hoe, with which he destroyed the weeds. He would lay out the ground in beds, and these he would plant with seeds. In a few days, these seeds would shoot up from the ground, and then little Peter would spend his time in pulling up the weeds, and in loosening the ground around his plants.</p>

<p>He was very fond of flowers, which he would grow in earthen pots. He had roses, pinks, daisies, myrtles, and many other things. Some of these were very beautiful, and Peter loved them almost as much as if they had been his brothers and sisters. He spent whole days in taking care of them, and was never so happy as among his flowerpots, and his little beds in the garden.</p>

<p>Peter&#8217;s father was very glad to see his son so industrious, and so fond of gardening. He told him about the God who had made the lilies and roses. As they worked together, cultivating plants and flowers, Peter learned about the kind Father in heaven who cared for them.</p>

<p>Thus the father, though he was poor, was happy, and Peter, though his feet were bare in summer, and though he labored all day, knew no sorrow. But at length the poor Irishman was suddenly taken sick, and died. Peter now had neither mother nor father. He had indeed no friends, and the people whom he knew were too poor to take him in. He was taken care of by an old woman for a few days, but she was no longer able to find enough food for him, and so he had to leave her.</p>

<p>He was very young, and now he was destitute of everything. His little straw hat was worn out, and he had nothing to wear upon his head. His shoes were gone, and, though the weather was growing cold, his feet were bare. His clothes, too, were thin. The morning after he left the old woman, he wandered about the city, not knowing what to do. He shivered, and his teeth chattered with cold.</p>

<p>He went along in the streets for some time, and met a great many people, but he did not dare to speak to them. He was very hungry, for he had eaten nothing the day before; but he did not know how to beg. He wandered about for several hours, till at length he came to a baker&#8217;s shop. The windows were filled with gingerbread, and everything that was good to eat. He put his little foot upon the step, and was about to enter, but the baker looked so sharply at him that Peter was too afraid to ask for anything, and so went away sadly.</p>

<p>As he walked, he passed through some of the finer streets, looking wistfully at the nice things he saw in the shop windows. But he had no money, and he felt all alone.</p>

<p>By now he was starving with hunger, and he resolved to enter some house and ask for a piece of bread. He came to a large house belonging to some rich man. From the sidewalk he could look down into the kitchen, which was below the main floor. Here he saw plenty of food, and as he approached the window, the steam of meat, and the flavor of pies and cakes, met his nose. <i>Surely,</i> thought the little boy, <i>the people here have so many good things, that they will not refuse me a crust of bread.</i></p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/16_woman.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="319" /></div>
<p>With this idea he ventured timidly down the steps, and knocked on the kitchen door. He there met a woman, and timidly asked her to give him something to eat. He told her his sad story, and pled with her to save him from being starved. But the woman had a hard heart, and would give him nothing. In vain did the little boy plead for a single crust of bread. This was refused, and the woman sternly commanded him to leave at once.</p>

<p>Sad, and almost brokenhearted, Peter left the place. He was now ashamed to be seen in the crowded streets, so he retired to a remote part of the city. Here he walked about in the narrow lanes till evening.</p>

<p>When it was dark, he sat down upon a stone, and gave himself up to grief. He was chilled with the cold night wind, for his head and feet were bare, and his clothes were very thin. It soon began to rain, and at length it fell in showers. Peter was wet to the skin. But he had nowhere to go, so he continued to sit upon the stone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Father in Heaven,&#8221; he prayed, &#8220;remember little Peter and take care of him, for Jesus&#8217; sake.&#8221; And so, with his head leaning upon his hand, he remained for a long time, trembling with the wet and cold. He thought of his poor father, and of the happy days he had spent in attending his flowers. He thought of his mother, too, whom he remembered very well, though she had been dead two years.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/16_sitting.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="229" /></div>
<p>And now, for the first time, he began to weep. No one saw him, for it was very dark, and few people passed along the narrow street. His tears mingled with the rain that ran down his cheeks, and his sobs were lost amid the pattering of the water that fell from the houses.</p>

<p>But there was One to hear. The kind Father in heaven was watching over the poor boy who sat in his lonely and desolate situation. About nine o&#8217;clock, a man was passing by the place where Peter sat. It was so dark that he saw nothing, but he thought he heard the voice of someone in distress. He stopped and listened. He then distinctly heard the sobbing of a child.</p>

<p>At this moment, someone happened walk by with a lantern. The light shone on the little boy that was sitting alone upon a stone. The kind-hearted man was touched with pity, for he saw that the child was weeping, and that he was exposed to the cold night air and the drenching rain.</p>

<p>He approached, and asked the boy why he was there. Peter told him his story, and the good man wept in sorrow. &#8220;But come with me, my boy,&#8221; said he, &#8220;come with me. I will take you to a warm room, and I will give you food. Come with me, and if you are a good boy, I will be your father, and you shall want for nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, kind sir, I know God has sent you,&#8221; Peter said gladly. He took hold of the man&#8217;s hand, and trotted along the pavement with his bare feet. They soon reached the house, and Peter warmed himself by a good fire. He had then a bowl of bread and milk, and afterwards was provided with a warm bed.</p>

<p>As he lay down, he thanked his Father in heaven, who had thus turned his sorrow into joy; and his heart was full of gratitude to the kind man who had brought him home to his house. After a night of sweet sleep, Peter woke up, and again gave thanks to God.</p>

<p>I need hardly tell you the remainder of Peter&#8217;s story. He lived with the man who had brought him home, and, by his good conduct, won the favor of all who knew him. When he grew up, he chose to be a gardener; and, as he was very industrious, he saved up a good deal of money, and built himself a small house. By the side of it was a neat little garden, where he raised vegetables and flowers. These he would sell; and thus he lived very happily. And so, my little reader, you can see how the loving Heavenly Father cares for those who will put their trust in Him. Anyone, however poor, may be happy like this little Irish boy.</p>

<h1>Bee Obedient</h1>

<p class="author">Effie M. Williams</p>

<p>&#8220;I have something to show you,&#8221; said Grandma after breakfast the next morning. &#8220;Come with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, a little calf!&#8221; exclaimed Don a moment later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he cute?&#8221; cried Joyce. &#8220;See how wobbly his legs are. What&#8217;s his name, Grandma?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grandpa says he&#8217;s not going to bother naming him, when he has two bright grandchildren here on the farm,&#8221; answered Grandma, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he mean that <i>we</i> can name him?&#8221; asked Joyce.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Grandma, &#8220;he means just that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Don,&#8221; cried Joyce, &#8220;what shall we call him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think Bruno is a nice name,&#8221; said Don.</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I; we&#8217;ll call him Bruno,&#8221; agreed Joyce.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if he would let me pet him,&#8221; said Don, gently touching the calf on his small white nose.</p>

<p>The little fellow tossed his head and wobbled over to the other side of his mother. The children laughed merrily; and they were so interested in watching the little creature that Grandma had to leave them and go back to her work.</p>

<p>The hours passed by very quickly and very happily&#8212;there were so many new things to do! Of course Joyce had to write a long letter to Mother, telling her about the sting of the bee, the new little calf, and many other interesting things.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon the children remembered about the cows, and they thought they would pump the trough full of water ahead of time. It was such fun that they kept on pumping until the trough overflowed, and the ground around it was all muddy.</p>

<p>After supper, they let down the bars for the cows to come through. The cows had just finished drinking, when Don slipped in the mud and fell backward right into the trough. He kicked and splashed about, trying to get out; and Joyce got a good drenching when she tried to help him. Grandpa had to come to the rescue and fish him out. Then they all had a good laugh&#8212;even Don. The children could not watch the milking that night, because they had to go to the house and put on dry clothes.</p>

<p>Later in the evening, they reminded Grandma that she had promised to tell them a story. They drew their chairs close to hers, and she began:</p>

<p>&#8220;It was to be a story about a bee, wasn&#8217;t it? Well, this bee has a sharp sting, and it goes very deep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope it will never sting me, then,&#8221; said Joyce.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not,&#8221; said Grandma. &#8220;The boy and girl in my story were stung severely; but it was all their own fault, as you shall see.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anna and her brother lived near a pond, and when the cold weather came it was great fun to skate on the ice. Oftentimes they would slide across it on their way to school. One morning, as their mother buttoned their coats, she said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t go across the ice this morning, children. It has begun to thaw, and it is dangerous.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;No, we won&#8217;t,&#8217; they promised.</p>

<p>&#8220;When they reached the pond, Willie said, &#8216;Why, see, Anna, how hard and thick the ice looks. Come on, let&#8217;s slide across it.&#8217;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/17_bee.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="246" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Instantly the bee began to buzz about Anna&#8217;s ears. &#8216;Bz-z-z-z-z! Don&#8217;t do it!&#8217; said the bee. &#8216;It&#8217;s dangerous. You promised Mother.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;We&#8217;d better not, Willie,&#8217; said Anna quickly. &#8216;We promised Mother, you know.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;But Mother&#8217;ll never know,&#8217; said Willie.</p>

<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;But you <i>promised</i>,&#8217; buzzed the bee again.</p>

<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Mother thought the ice was thawing,&#8217; added Willie. &#8216;She won&#8217;t care, when she knows it isn&#8217;t. You may do as you like, Anna; but I&#8217;m going to slide across right now.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;When Anna saw her brother starting across the pond, she followed, in spite of the bee. But they had gone only a little way when the ice began to crack, and then to give way under them.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/17_ice.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="296" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Anna turned and hurried back to the bank; but Willie had gone too far. She saw him go down in the icy water; and she ran to the road, screaming at the top of her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man was passing by at that moment. He picked up a board and ran to the pond as fast as he could. And he reached it just in time to save little Willie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dragging the lad up on to the bank, he called loudly for someone to come and help him. Two or three men came running; and they worked over Willie, until at last he opened his blue eyes and asked faintly, &#8216;Where am I?&#8217; Then they took him home to his mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;She thanked God for saving the life of her disobedient boy, but the danger was not yet past. For many weeks, Willie was a very sick little boy. When at last they carried him downstairs, he lay on the sofa day after day, pale and quiet&#8212;sadly changed from the merry, romping Willie of other days. The springtime came; but it was a long time before he could go into the woods with Anna to hunt for wild flowers or sail his toy boats on the pond.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/17_sick.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="203" /></div>
<p>&#8220;There was no more school for Willie that year. As Anna trudged off alone day after day, she seemed to hear again and again the buzzing of the bee about her ears&#8212;&#8216;Bz-z-z-z! You promised Mother!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;I heard it so plainly,&#8217; she would say to herself. &#8216;It must have been my conscience. But I wouldn&#8217;t listen&#8212;and I <i>almost</i> lost my brother.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<p>The old farmhouse kitchen was very quiet for a moment, after Grandma had finished her story. Nothing was heard but the ticking of the old-fashioned clock.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad it didn&#8217;t happen&#8212;<i>quite</i>!&#8221; said Joyce at last. &#8220;What was the bee&#8217;s name, Grandma?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bee Obedient,&#8221; answered Grandma. &#8220;It has sometimes stung boys and girls so deeply that the hurt has never been healed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; added Grandma cheerily, &#8220;this bee will never bother you, if you listen to its first little buzz.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will, Grandma, we will!&#8221; cried the children as they drifted off to the Land of Dreams.</p>

<h1>True Courage</h1>

<p class="author">&#8220;Aunt Kate&#8221;</p>

<p>Harry, what is the matter?&#8221; said his mother, one day, as he ran in from school, and throwing down his school bag, commenced crying passionately. &#8220;Have you been kept in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mama, but the boys have been laughing at me, and I can&#8217;t stand it. I wish you would let me go to some other school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do to make them laugh, Harry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They asked me to go with them and tip a poor woman&#8217;s apple stand over, and said it was first rate fun, and that Robert Bell had plenty of pocket money to pay the damages.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/18_mad.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="195" /></div>
<p>&#8220;What did you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said my mother would feel dreadfully to have me do such a mean thing. And then they laughed, and Robert Bell said, &#8216;Does your mother know you are out?&#8217; and another boy said I was &#8216;tied to your apron string.&#8217; Then they called me a &#8216;tattletale,&#8217; and said I was going to &#8216;tell the teacher&#8217; on them, and when I said, &#8216;I have never been brought up to tell tales,&#8217; Robert Bell called out, &#8216;There&#8217;s his mother again. Three cheers for Harry Reed&#8217;s mother!&#8217; I felt angry enough to knock him down!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep calm, my boy,&#8221; said Mrs. Reed. &#8220;Come, sit down, and let me see whether you have any reason to be so excited.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mama, you don&#8217;t know how provoking it is to be laughed at, or you wouldn&#8217;t say so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If Mother doesn&#8217;t, I do,&#8221; said Henry&#8217;s father, who had come in just in time to hear his story. &#8220;And I know a better way than knocking down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that, Papa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have true courage, my boy, and don&#8217;t notice their laughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have tried, and I cannot bear it, Papa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of boy is Robert, Harry?&#8221; said Mr. Reed.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a new scholar, his father is rich, and he has plenty of money in his pocket every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he a good boy in school?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir. Our teacher told him today that he was more trouble than all the rest put together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose if you were a man, you would fight a duel with Robert Bell, and one kill the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Papa, you don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be so wicked!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When grown-up people feel as you did today, when you wanted to knock Robert down, they sometimes meet and shoot at each other with pistols, because they won&#8217;t stand being laughed at. It takes more real courage, my dear boy, to do right in spite of ridicule, than to fight. I hope you will show yourself a truly brave boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will try, Papa, but it is very hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a while things went on pretty smoothly with Harry, but one day he came home looking flushed and unhappy. He sat down to dinner, but just as he had begun to eat, he laid down his knife and fork, and leaning back in his chair, said, &#8220;I am not hungry, Mama.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been eating something, Harry?&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/18_potatoes1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="297" /></div>
<p>&#8220;No, Mama&#8212;but Robert Bell acts worse than ever. I wish you would let me fight him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has he done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Today we were playing ball, and a little girl, no bigger than our Matty, came by with a basket of potatoes as heavy as she could carry, and Robert Bell tipped it upside down, and scattered them into the gutter. The little girl cried out loud, and as I started to go and pick them up, Robert began to laugh, and said, &#8216;Go help your sister, Harry!&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you go and help her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mama. The boys laughed so much, I could not do it.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/18_potatoes2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="260" /></div>
<p>&#8220;My dear Harry, your fear of ridicule has made you do wrong already. You fear man more than God. If you begin to sin because you&#8217;re afraid of being laughed at, there is no telling where you will stop. I have known young men who have started out in life with good principles. But they began associating with wicked companions, and, rather than have their friends know that they are obeying a good mother&#8217;s counsel, they yield to temptation and go to ruin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have felt sorry all day, every time I have thought of that poor little girl, Mama.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Harry, then take a bold stand on the side of right, and make up your mind you will not do wrong, even if you are laughed at.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mama, I have not told you half the trouble I have had today. My piece to recite began, &#8216;Mother, when I learned that thou wast dead.&#8217; I found it in the new book Uncle Edward gave me. I knew it by heart, but as soon as I said the first line, I saw Robert Bell winking and laughing. It put me all out, and I forgot half of it, and spoke so poorly that Mr. Lee told me to memorize my piece perfectly next time. I&#8217;ll know better than to try that piece again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Harry, are you going to let Robert Bell make you ashamed of your mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mama, but I&#8217;m tired of trying to get along. After school, the boys went off swimming. They begged me to go, and said Papa was away from home and never would know it, and you wouldn&#8217;t care. I knew better, and refused a good many times without giving any reason. At last Robert came up and said, &#8216;His mother won&#8217;t let him,&#8217; and they went off singing, &#8216;Mother, when I learned that thou wast dead!&#8217; Now, Mama, how can I stay at such a school?&#8221;</p>

<div class="center"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/18_lunch.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Harry, you may find the same trials at any school, and after you leave school, and all through life. Wicked young men will seek to lead you astray by laughing at your mother&#8217;s influence and instructions. Now, my boy, what are you to do? Will you yield to the fear of ridicule, and commit one sin after another until you are as bad and perhaps worse than those who laugh at you, or will you rise above it, and show a true Christian courage? If you can&#8217;t bear it now, you will find it still harder when you are a man in size, and when your evil passions have strengthened. Pray to God to help you, and when you find that the boys want to make fun of you, just go on doing right. They will soon see your firmness, and let you alone. Think of this: if Christopher Columbus had been like you he never would have discovered America.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was he ever laughed at, Mama?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Harry. He had to bear a great deal of ridicule before he could persuade people that he was anything but an crazy adventurer. When he tried to prove the existence of undiscovered land beyond the sea, he was laughed at and persecuted in many ways. He did not mind it, but went on and accomplished his discovery, and silenced his adversaries. He is now a revered and honored man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody can&#8217;t be like Christopher Columbus, Mama.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe not, my dear boy, but everyone can imitate Christ. Wicked men clothed Him in purple robes, mocked Him, blindfolded Him, and smote Him in the face. They laughed at Him, and shook their heads at Him when He was dying. He never became angry, though His slightest wish could have destroyed them. He prayed for His cruel mockers with His last breath. Now, Harry, if you will pray to Christ, He will make you a brave, manly Christian, and you will be thankful, as long as you live, that you learned to bear ridicule in your youth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Mother, I will try to remember all you have said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do, my boy, and when you are older, you will be able to resist the temptations which you will meet in every effort to do right, and come out of it all a truly courageous man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harry did not forget his mother&#8217;s good advice. He feels very sorry that he let that little girl sit and cry, when he might have picked up her potatoes. He has never shown such cowardice again. If he goes on as he has begun, the school boys will find laughing at Harry Reed is very unprofitable business, and will be obliged to seek some other means of amusement.</p>

<h1>Holding Jesus&#8217; Hand</h1>

<p class="author">Georgia C. Elliott</p>

<p>Hal went strolling in the big forest that was near his home. He did not intend to go far, for he was eight years old, and one could get lost among so many trees. He went slowly along, but always there was something interesting just ahead. Some pretty violets, or the ridge made by the curious little mole that could dig with the end of its nose. There is always plenty to see in a Michigan forest.</p>

<p>Hal wandered this way and that, and after a while he came to a clearing. The trees had been cut down and hauled away to the lumber mills. Hal followed the dim little path, which led among the great, wide stumps of trees, some of them as wide as a table. Everywhere bushes and blackberry vines covered the ground, while the big stumps had great thick roots reaching out from all sides. Hal wandered along looking&#8212;here would be a good place for tiny quail and rabbits.</p>

<p>Suddenly, there was a rumble and a cracking of thunder! It seemed to come right out of the forest. Hal looked up quickly. Black clouds were rolling over the tall treetops. They soon covered the sky, and out of them came fiery streaks of lightning and great crashes of thunder, while a fierce wind began tearing through the trees.</p>

<p>What could he do? Where could he go for shelter? Hal knew better than to run toward the forest. Once he had seen great trees come crashing down in a strong wind; he did not want a tree to fall on him. And now the rain began to fall. Great drops&#8212;it seemed there was a teaspoonful to each drop&#8212;hammered on the stumps and bushes, and on Hal&#8217;s uncovered head.</p>

<p>Hal was frightened. All around him the bushes were thrashing about in the wind, and the water was coming down so fast. Like a scared rabbit he darted over to a big stump and crept in close against the rough bark and the great, friendly roots. My, how the lighting flashed, how the thunder crashed, and how the raindrops splashed! Hal was soon drenched to the skin. But he didn&#8217;t mind the wet; he would change when he got home.</p>

<p>Home! Why, there wouldn&#8217;t be any path to go home by now; the rain would wash away every little trace of a path! Hal tried to look at the trees to see if he could tell where he had come out into the clearing. But the rain pelted him so hard he could not see anything. Then he was scared; he snuggled closer to the rough stump and covered his face with his hands. There he prayed; prayed that Jesus would help him and show him the way home when the storm was over.</p>

<p>After a while the storm grew less fierce, the bushes ceased to thrash about, the lightning became less vivid, the thunder sounded farther off, and the rain became a thin mist. Soon the sun shone through the broken clouds, and how the wet leaves and bushes did sparkle!</p>

<p>Hal rose from beside the stump. Which way out of the clearing? &#8220;I don&#8217;t know which way to go,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;so I will walk along just as though Jesus were holding my hand. I will go the way I believe He would lead me, if He were taking me home.&#8221;</p>

<p>He passed through the clearing to the forest&#8217;s edge. There was no path in the forest, just wet leaves; slowly Hal walked along, making a turn here and there. He was not afraid, he was holding hands with Jesus.</p>

<p>After a bit he made a turn, and there he saw familiar things. Now he knew the way. The Lord had held his hand and guided him home.</p>

<h1>With a Will, Joe!</h1>

<p class="author">Author Unknown</p>

<p>It was a summer afternoon; the street was empty of all traffic, for the heat was intense.</p>

<p>A wheelbarrow stood before Mrs. Robbins&#8217; door. I sauntered languidly along on the shady side opposite the widow&#8217;s house, and noticed her boy bringing out some linen in a basket, to put on the wheelbarrow.</p>

<p>I was surprised at the size of the basket he was lugging along the passage and lifting on to the wheelbarrow, and paused to look at him. He pulled, and dragged, and then resting a moment began again, and in the silence of the street, I heard him saying something to himself.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/20_wheelbarrow.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="382" /></div>
<p>I half crossed the road. He was too busy to notice me, and then, in a pause of his toil, I heard him gasp out, &#8220;With a will, Joe!&#8221; He was encouraging himself to a further effort with these words. At last, bringing the large basket to the curbstone, he ran in and got a piece of smooth wood to use as a lever. Resting one end of the basket on the wheelbarrow, he heaved up the other end, and saying, a little louder than before, &#8220;With a will, Joe,&#8221; the basket was mounted on to the wheelbarrow. As he rested, and looked proudly at his successful effort, he saw me. His round, red face, covered with perspiration, became scarlet for a moment, as I said, &#8220;That&#8217;s a brave boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mother&#8217;s voice sounded in the passage, &#8220;I&#8217;m coming, Joe!&#8221; and out she came, as the child, pointing to the basket, exclaimed, &#8220;I&#8217;ve managed it, Mother!&#8221; It was a pretty sight, the gratified smile of the widowed mother, as she fondly regarded her willing boy. Though no further word was spoken, the expression of satisfaction on their faces was very plain, and I have no doubt in each heart there was a throb of pleasure for which words have no language.</p>

<p>I went on my way, but the saying, &#8220;With a will, Joe,&#8221; went with me. How much there was in that simple phrase, &#8220;With a will!&#8221;</p>

<p>How different is our work according as we do it with or against our will. This little fellow might have cried or murmured, or left his mother to do the work, and been dissatisfied with himself, and a source of discontent to his mother; but he had spurred himself on to toil and duty, with his words, powerful in their simplicity, &#8220;With a will, Joe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Often since have I recalled the scene and the saying. When some young lady complains to me, &#8220;I have no time to give to doing good. I&#8217;ve visits to make, and shopping to do, and embroidery to finish, how can I help the poor when I&#8217;m so pressed for time?&#8221; I am apt to say mentally, &#8220;How different it would be with her, if she had ever said to herself, &#8216;With a will.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, with a will we can do almost anything that ought to be done; and without a will we can do nothing as it should be done. To all of us, whatever our station, there come difficulties and trials. If we yield to them, we are beaten down and conquered.</p>

<p>But if we, ourselves, conquer the temptation to do wrong, calling the strength of God to aid us in our struggle with the enemy, we shall grow stronger and more valiant with every battle, and less liable to fall again into temptation. Our wisdom and our duty are to rouse ourselves, to speak to our own hearts as the child did in his simple words, &#8220;With a will, Joe.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Finding the Way</h1>

<p class="author">Georgia C. Elliott</p>

<p>Eight-year-old Alicea wanted very much to ask her mother if she might go next door to play. But some ladies from the Missionary Society were talking with her mother, and it would not be polite to interrupt the conversation. So she stood outside the parlor door and wondered what to do.</p>

<p>At last she slipped inside the door and, softly crossing the room, stood behind her mother&#8217;s chair. One of the ladies was telling a story of her childhood. Alicea became so interested she forgot what she wanted to ask her mother, and listened to the story.</p>

<p>This is what the lady said: &#8220;When I was a little girl, I wanted very much to be a Christian. But no one ever explained to me what I must do to be one, and for a long time my heart was hungry and thirsty to find out the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then one day an old man told in meeting how he found the way, even as a little boy. The old man said he went one day in real earnestness, and got down on his knees and asked God to forgive all his naughty doings, and make him God&#8217;s own little boy, and from that day on he believed God had forgiven him and made him His child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After I heard that old man,&#8221; said the lady, &#8220;I also went and asked God to make me His little girl, and to forgive all my bad doings. And,&#8221; she added smilingly, &#8220;I believe He did. He has helped me ever since, and I am so thankful.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Alicea listened to this talk, she thought, <i>Why, that is just what I have wanted to know about&#8212;how to find God.</i> Playing next door didn&#8217;t seem so important anymore. When the lady had finished her story, Alicea slipped out of the room as quietly as she had come and went to her bedroom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear God,&#8221; she prayed, as she knelt down by her bed. &#8220;Will You forgive all the naughty things I have done? Please forgive me for the cross words I said to Sister and for complaining to Mother. I am sorry for hiding Brother&#8217;s book and telling a lie about it. I don&#8217;t want to lie or be cross again!&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time the tears were quietly running down Alicea&#8217;s cheeks. As she brushed them away, she thought of how God had helped the lady in the parlor, and she said, &#8220;Please make me Your little girl and help me be good. I promise to read my Bible and learn how You want me to live. I <i>do</i> want to please You always, if You would help me, dear God.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alicea meant every word she said, for she truly wanted to know God was pleased with her. As she knelt by her bed such a sweetness and joy came into her heart that she was sure God had heard her prayer. Now she, too, could say she found the way to God.</p>

<h1>Gracie&#8217;s Lesson</h1>

<p class="author">Author Unknown</p>

<p>Gracie was fourteen, and Norma was twelve, and they were sisters. But I think that two sisters were never more unlike than were Gracie and Norma Wilson. Norma, who was the younger, was as orderly a little lady as one could wish to see, while Gracie was just the reverse.</p>

<p>Often their mother would say, in a despairing tone, &#8220;Gracie, I do wish you would care for your room and frocks as Norma cares for hers. Why, you go out with buttons loose, or entirely off your dress, or your frocks unmended, not to speak of the untidiness of your room. If only you would take an interest in such things it would gratify me so much. Without an orderly mind, no girl can aspire to become a useful member of society.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Gracie would try to make excuses for her shortcomings, pleading this thing or that as the real cause of her negligence. But her poor mother, at her wits&#8217; end to devise some way by which Gracie might be aroused to a sense of her duty, would shake her head and say: &#8220;Dearest child, there is no excuse for your slighting your work, either on your clothes or in your room. You have plenty of time for both and should force yourself to perform your share of the labor that falls to you to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>And while Mrs. Wilson was thus advising and entreating her eldest daughter to do her duty in such small household matters, Norma was busy tidying up her dainty room or sewing on her summer frocks, mending tears, or putting on buttons and hooks and eyes. She was such a cheerful, busy little miss that Gracie&#8217;s laziness even more noticeable compared with her diligence.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/22_hammock.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="348" /></div>
<p>One afternoon, while Gracie was sitting idly in the hammock which swung in the broad, awning-covered porch, the phone bell rang and Norma answered it. The message which reached her ear made her smile very happily, and she answered, &#8220;Oh, yes, indeed, we shall be delighted to go, and thank you for both of us ever and ever so much. What time shall we be ready&#8212;at four o&#8217;clock this afternoon? All right. And we shall prepare some supper? Yes, all right, we&#8217;ll be most happy to do so. Goodbye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then to the porch ran Norma, crying to Gracie, excitedly, &#8220;Oh, sister, Mrs. Jackson has invited us&#8212;you and me&#8212;to go with her and Flora and Tommy for a long outing. We are to stop on the beach&#8212;down at Blake Island&#8212;and have a picnic supper by moonlight. We&#8217;ll return home about nine o&#8217;clock. Won&#8217;t that be splendid? I know Mama will be so happy to have us go, so I accepted for both of us. Mama won&#8217;t be home for over an hour. And we are to start at four. It is now two o&#8217;clock. We&#8217;ll have to be stirring if we are to be ready when Mrs. Jackson calls. And she must not be kept waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we to take supper?&#8221; asked Gracie, lazily, not making any sign of getting out of the hammock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Mrs. Jackson said we&#8217;d take it along. She said she would take sandwiches, cookies, and jelly. We can supply something else. Suppose we have some boiled eggs. And I&#8217;ll run to the baker&#8217;s and get a nice cake&#8212;one of those delicious white ones, you know. Won&#8217;t it be splendid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall you wear?&#8221; asked Gracie, now bestirring herself a bit.</p>

<p>&#8220;My pink lawn, I guess,&#8221; replied Norma. &#8220;But I shall have to hurry, for the eggs must be boiled at once, so as to give them time to get cold and solid in the ice box. Otherwise, they wouldn&#8217;t be fit to take in the picnic basket.&#8221;</p>

<p>And away ran busy Norma to the kitchen to put the eggs to boil.</p>

<p>Within a short time Norma had the eggs nicely boiled and cooling in the ice box while she was getting her frock, shoes, hat, and other accessories to her afternoon attire, laid out all ready to wear.</p>

<p>But Gracie was not quite so energetic. She had left the hammock and gone to her own room to look over her frocks to see which one might be fit to wear. A blue dimity was selected as being in the best wearing condition, but in looking it over she found a rent in the skirt and two buttons gone. &#8220;Oh, just my luck,&#8221; she declared impatiently. &#8220;I never have a frock in shape to put right on. I do believe I&#8217;ll ask Mama&#8212;if she has returned&#8212;to sew on the buttons and mend the rent. Let me see&#8212;the hem is torn in places on my white lawn. The buttons are off my checked batiste. Yes, this blue dimity will be the best.&#8221; So taking it in her arms, she went downstairs to the sitting room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson had just returned from making some calls and was listening to Norma&#8217;s explanation of the good time in store for Gracie and herself that afternoon and evening. &#8220;I knew you would not mind our going Mama,&#8221; Norma was saying, &#8220;so I just accepted at the moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed, I shall not object,&#8221; said Mrs. Wilson. &#8220;In fact, I am delighted that Mrs. Jackson has invited you to go with her and her lovely children. You will have a splendid time, I know. And how about your supper? Have you everything ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am just going to prepare some eggs this very minute,&#8221; explained Norma. &#8220;And,&#8221; turning to Gracie, &#8220;won&#8217;t you go after some cake and some fruit, sister?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gracie frowned. &#8220;I&#8217;ll not have the time.&#8221; she complained. &#8220;And,&#8221; appealing to her mother, &#8220;Mama, will you be good enough to fix this frock for me to wear? I&#8217;ve got to wash and comb and do ever so many things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson shook her head. &#8220;Gracie, you must have your lesson first or last. Now is a very good time for it. You must fix your own frock, my child. I have urged you, time and again, to keep your clothes neatly mended. If you let your things go&#8212;well, you must suffer the consequences. And, you must assist Norma in preparing the supper. It is not fair that she should have the bulk of the work of preparation to do. You must shoulder your share of it.&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/22_sewing.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="355" /></div>
<p>Gracie, her face burning with shame, went upstairs and began to fix her frock. But hardly had she begun when her mother&#8217;s voice called to her: &#8220;You would better go for the cake, daughter, before sitting down to mend. If by any chance you should not be ready to go when Mrs. Jackson calls for you, Norma must not be disappointed and shall have her basket of supper ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gracie began to beg off, but her mother was firm. &#8220;Do as I say, daughter, and start at once to the baker&#8217;s for the cake. Stop on the way back and buy a bag of nice fruit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gracie had to obey, but did it reluctantly. She feared she would not be ready to go when four o&#8217;clock arrived, for there was so much to be done in preparation. She hurried to the baker&#8217;s and got the cake; stopped on the way back home and bought a bag of fruit. But she saw by the town clock that there was only forty-five minutes left until it would be time to start on their trip.</p>

<p>For a moment she felt very much out of sorts over the fact that she had been obliged to go after the cake and fruit, but the longer she thought of it the clearer became her own fault. Yes, she had been very indifferent about her work. And if she missed getting the trip&#8212;well, it would be her lesson.</p>

<p>As soon as Gracie gave the cake and fruit into Norma&#8217;s hands she ran up stairs to fix her frock. Norma was all ready, looking as sweet in her fresh lawn frock as could be. The basket was prepared for the supper, lined with a soft white napkin. Into the basket Norma put a dozen nicely prepared eggs, wrapped about with white paper. Then came the cake, also appetizingly fixed in dainty fashion; then the yellow oranges, luscious, pink peaches and golden yellow pears.</p>

<p>At precisely ten minutes before four Norma was waiting on the porch. At exactly four Mrs. Jackson&#8217;s car came driving up.</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready?&#8221; called out Mrs. Jackson.</p>

<p>Just as Norma was about to offer some excuse for her tardy sister, her mother came upon the porch, and, after chatting in a cordial manner for a few moments with Mrs. Jackson, she told Norma to take the basket and get in the car. &#8220;It is Gracie&#8217;s own fault that she is delayed this way, and she&#8217;ll have a lesson today that she will profit by. I am quite sure she&#8217;ll never miss another picnic through her own idleness.</p>

<p>Then, while Norma was getting into the automobile, Mrs. Wilson spoke in low tones to Mrs. Jackson, explaining why Gracie would not be able to go on the outing that day. Although all expressed regrets that Gracie was to be left behind, they knew it was for the best that she be taught a lesson through disappointment.</p>

<p>As the car drove off down the road toward Blake Island, carrying the happy picnic party, Gracie, with tears in her eyes, stood looking from the window after them. And in her heart she knew that her disappointment was due to her own shortcomings. And she determined to do better from then on.</p>

<h1>Fighting the Good Fight</h1>

<p class="author">S. W. Van Trump</p>

<p>A number of years ago, at an orphan home in a northern state, there lived a boy whom we shall call Will Jones. He was just an ordinary boy. No, he was not so in one respect, which I must point out, to his discredit. Will Jones had a temper that distinguished him from the general run of boys. Will&#8217;s temper might have been inherited from a Spanish pirate, and yet Will was a boy whom everyone loved; but this hair-trigger temper at times terribly spoiled things. It would be tedious to recount his uprisings of anger, and the direful consequences that often followed.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/23_fighting.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="261" /></div>
<p>Mr. Custer, the superintendent of the home, had hopefully striven to lead Will to the paths of right; but it was a difficult task.</p>

<p>Sometimes it needs but one small breach to begin the overthrow of a giant wall. One small key, if it is the right one, will open the most resisting door. One small phrase may start a germ-thought growing in a human mind which in after-years may become a mighty oak of character. So Will Jones, the incorrigible fighter was to demonstrate this principle, as we shall see.</p>

<p>On a Sunday evening, as the hundred or more orphans met at vespers and sang, &#8220;<a href="../../../music/Onward_Christian_Soldiers/index.html" title="Onward Christian Soldiers">Onward, Christian Soldiers</a>,&#8221; they saw a stranger seated at the speaker&#8217;s desk in the home chapel. He was a venerable old man, straight and dignified, his hoary head a crown of honor; for he was all that he appeared&#8212;a father in Israel.</p>

<p>In a brief speech he told the boys that he had once been a Union soldier, and had fought in the battles of his country. He told of the courage it required to face death upon the battlefield. He described the charges his company had made and met, the sieges and the marches, the sufferings they endured, and, lastly, the joys that victory and the end of the conflict brought.</p>

<p>Then, when the boys were at the height of interested expectancy, he skillfully drew the lesson he wanted them to learn. He told of a greater warfare, requiring a higher courage, and bringing as a reward a larger and more enduring victory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the real soldiers are the Christian soldiers; the real battle is the battle against sin; the real battleground is where that silent struggle is constantly waging within our minds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he told of Paul, who said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;I have fought a good fight.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+4%3A7" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 4:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 4:7)</span></a></span> &#8220;Did any of you boys ever fight a <i>bad</i> fight?&#8221; Every head but one turned to a common point at this juncture, and the eyes of only one boy remained upon the speaker. Will Jones had the record for bad fights, and that is why about ninety-nine pairs of eyes had involuntarily sought him out when the speaker asked the question, which he hoped each would ask himself. And the reason Will Jones did not look around accusingly at any of the other boys was because he had taken to heart all that had been said. Conviction had taken hold of him, and the turning-point had come: godly repentance led to salvation and a new life. Henceforth he determined so to live that he could say with Paul, <span class="scripture">&#8220;I have fought a good fight.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>No sooner does a boy determine to fight the good fight than Satan accepts the challenge, and gives him a combat such as will seem like a <span class="scripture">&#8220;fiery trial&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+4%3A12" title="I&nbsp;Peter 4:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 4:12)</span></a></span> to try him. These struggles develop the moral backbone; and if a boy does not give in, he will find his moral courage increasing with each moral fight. Just let that thought stay in your mind, underscored in bold-faced italics, and printed in indelible ink; and if you have a tendency to be a spiritual &#8220;jelly-back,&#8221; it will be like a rod of steel to your spine.</p>

<p>The fear of Will Jones&#8217;s knuckles had won a degree of peace for him. He had lived a sort of armed truce, so to speak. Now he was subjected to petty persecutions by mean boys who took advantage of his new stand. He did not put on the look of a martyr either, but kept good-natured even when the old volcano within was rumbling and threatening to bury the tormentors in hot lava and ashes. The old desire to fight the bad fight was turned into the new channel of determination to fight the good fight.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/23_saved.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="255" /></div>
<p>Today Will Jones is still a good fighter, and I hope he always will be, and someday will be crowned with eternal victory; for he who fights the good fight is fighting for eternity.</p>

<p>Pray for God&#8217;s grace so to live each day, subduing every sinful thought, that at night when you kneel to pray you can say to the Lord, &#8220;I have fought a good fight today.&#8221; Will you?</p>

<h1>&#8220;Come to Me&#8221;</h1>

<p class="author">Amy C. Walton</p>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">Rosalie, a young actress, has heard about the Shepherd who is seeking to gather lost lambs into His fold. In this chapter, she is traveling with her dying mother to the next fair, where her father is waiting for them. Jessie, a young lady who had run away to join a circus not long before, has taken refuge with them as she tries to find her way home.</p>
</div>


<hr class="minor" />
<p>When Rosalie awoke, she saw her mother sitting up in bed. Her breathing was very painful, and she was holding her hand to her side, as if she were in much pain.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/24_sleeping.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="349" /></div>
<p>The candle had burnt low in the socket, and the early morning light was stealing into the caravan. Jessie was still asleep in the corner, with her head leaning against the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rosalie,&#8221; said her mother, under her breath, &#8220;where are we, and who is that girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re halfway to the town, Mummy&#8212;out by a moor; and that&#8217;s Britannia!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked her mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the girl we saw riding on that circus car in Lesborough, and she has run away, she was so miserable there.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then Rosalie told her mother the sad story the girl had related the night before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor thing! Poor young thing!&#8221; said the sick woman. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you took her in; mind you give her a good breakfast. She does well to go back to her mother; it&#8217;s the best thing she can do. Is she asleep, Rosalie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mummy dear, she went to sleep before I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think it would wake her if you were to sing to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mummy dear, I shouldn&#8217;t think so, if I didn&#8217;t sing very loud.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then could you sing me your hymn once more? I&#8217;ve had the tune in my ears all night, and I should so much like to hear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>So little Rosalie sang her hymn. She had a sweet low voice, and she sang it very well; if she had heard a tune once she never forgot it.</p>

<p>When she had finished singing, Jessie moved, and opened her eyes, and looked up with a smile, as if she were in the midst of a pleasant dream. Then, as she saw the inside of the caravan, the sick woman, and Rosalie, she remembered where she was, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; said the child, running up to her, and putting her arms round her neck. &#8220;Were you thinking of your mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dear,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I was dreaming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What were you dreaming?&#8221; asked Rosalie&#8217;s mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was dreaming I was at home, and it was Sunday, and we were at the Bible class, and singing the hymn we always begin with. I was singing it when I woke, and it made me cry to think it wasn&#8217;t true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it was my singing that made you dream it,&#8221; said Rosalie; &#8220;I&#8217;ve been singing to my mummy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I should think that was it,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;What did you sing? Will you sing it to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosalie sang over again the first verse of the hymn. To her surprise, Jessie started from her seat and seized her by the hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where <i>did</i> you get that?&#8221; she asked hurriedly. &#8220;That&#8217;s the very hymn I was singing in my dream. We always sing it on Sunday afternoons at our Bible class.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have it on a card,&#8221; said Rosalie, bringing her favorite card down from the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, who gave you that?&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;It&#8217;s just like mine; mine has a ribbon in it just that color! Where <i>did</i> you get it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were passing through a village,&#8221; said Rosalie, &#8220;and a kind woman gave it to me. We stopped there about an hour and she was singing it outside her cottage door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why it must have been our village, surely!&#8221; said Jessie. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think they have those cards anywhere else. What was the woman like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was a young woman with a very nice face; she had one little boy about two years old, and he was playing with his ball in front of the house. His mother was so good to us&#8212;she gave us some bread and milk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it must have been Mrs. Barker!&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;She lives close to us; our cottage is just a little farther up the road. She often sings when she&#8217;s at work. To think that you&#8217;ve been to our village! Oh, I wish you&#8217;d seen my mother!&#8221; she sighed.</p>

<p>About six o&#8217;clock Toby, the young caravan driver, came to the door, and asked how his mistress was, and if they were ready to start. He was very surprised when he saw Jessie sitting inside the caravan. But Rosalie told him in a few words how the poor girl came there, and asked him in what direction she ought to walk to get to her own home. Toby was very smart in knowing the way to nearly every place in the country, and he said that for ten miles farther their roads would be the same, and Jessie could ride with them in the caravan.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Songs_and_Stories_Book_2/24_talking.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" /></div>
<p>The poor girl was very grateful to them for all their kindness. She sat beside Rosalie&#8217;s mother all the morning, and did everything she could for her. The sick woman was very restless and wakeful. She was burning with fever, and tossed about from side to side of her bed. Every now and then her mind seemed to wander, and she talked of her mother and her sister Lucy, and of other things which Rosalie did not understand. Then she became quite sensible, and would repeat over and over again the words of the hymn, or would ask Rosalie to read to her once more about the lost sheep and the Good Shepherd.</p>

<p>When the child had read the parable, the mother turned to Jessie, and said to her, very earnestly, &#8220;Oh, <i>do</i> ask the Good Shepherd to find you now, Jessie; you&#8217;ll be so glad of it afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been so bad!&#8221; said Jessie, crying. &#8220;My mother has often talked to me, and Mrs. Leslie, the pastor&#8217;s wife, has, too; and yet, after all, I&#8217;ve gone and done this. I daren&#8217;t ever ask Him to find me now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not, Jessie?&#8221; said Rosalie&#8217;s mother. &#8220;Why not ask Him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, He would have nothing to say to me now,&#8221; said the girl, sobbing, and hiding her face in her hands. &#8220;If I&#8217;d only gone to Him that Sunday!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What Sunday?&#8221; asked Rosalie.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the Sunday before I left home. Mrs. Leslie talked to us so beautifully; it was about coming to Jesus. She asked us if we had come to Him to have our sins forgiven; and she said, &#8216;If you haven&#8217;t come to Him already, do come to Him today.&#8217; And then she begged those of us who hadn&#8217;t come to Him before, to go home when the class was over, and kneel down in our own rooms and ask Jesus to forgive us that very Sunday afternoon. I knew <i>I</i> had never come to Jesus, and I made up my mind that I would do as our teacher asked us. But, as soon as we were outside the parsonage, the girls began talking and laughing, and made fun of somebody&#8217;s bonnet that they had seen at church that morning. And when I got home I thought no more of coming to Jesus, and I never went to Him&#8212;and, oh, I wish that I had!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go <i>now</i>,&#8221; said Rosalie&#8217;s mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be any good,&#8221; said the girl sorrowfully. &#8220;If I thought it would&#8212;if I only thought He would forgive me, I would do anything&#8212;I would walk twice the distance home!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220; <span class="scripture">&#8216;He [goeth] after that which is lost, until he find it,&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+15%3A4" title="Luke 15:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 15:4)</span></a></span>&#8221; said the sick woman. &#8220;Are <i>you</i> lost, Jessie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;that&#8217;s just what I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then He is going after you,&#8221; said Rosalie&#8217;s mother again.</p>

<p>Jessie walked to the door of the caravan, and sat looking out without speaking. The sunlight was streaming on the purple heather, which was spread like a carpet on both sides of the road. Quiet little roadside springs trickled through the moss and ran across the path. The travelers had left the pine forest behind, and there was not a single tree in sight&#8212;nothing but large gray rocks and occasional patches of bright yellow gorse among the miles and miles of heather.</p>

<p>At last they came to a large signpost, at a corner where four roads met; here Toby said Jessie must leave them. But before she went there was a little whispered conversation between Rosalie and her mother, which ended in Jessie&#8217;s carrying away in her pocket no less than ten dollars of the gift they&#8217;d been given.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll need it before you get home, dear,&#8221; said the sick woman; &#8220;and mind you go straight to your mother. Don&#8217;t stop till you run right into her arms!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Jessie.</p>

<p>The poor girl was very sorry to leave them. She kissed Rosalie and her mother many times; and as she went down the road, she kept turning round to wave her handkerchief, till the caravan was quite out of sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;So those girls knew nothing about it, Rosalie darling,&#8221; said her mother, when Jessie was gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing about what, Mummy dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember the girls that stood by our show when the procession went past? They wished they were Britannia, and thought she must be so happy and glad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; said Rosalie; &#8220;they knew nothing about it. All the time poor Jessie was so miserable she did not know what to do with herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just the mistake I made, Rosalie darling, till I came behind the scenes, and knew how different everything looks when one is there. And so it is, dear, with everything of this world; it is all disappointing and vain when one gets to know it well.&#8221;</p>

<p>As evening drew on, they left the moor behind, and turned into a very dark and shady road with trees on both sides of the way. Rosalie&#8217;s mother was sleeping, for the first time since early morning, and Rosalie sat and looked out at the door of the caravan. The wood was very thick, and the long shadows of the trees fell across the road. Every now and then they disturbed four or five rabbits that were enjoying themselves by the side of the path, which ran headlong into their snug little holes as soon as they heard the creaking of the caravan wheels. Then an owl startled Rosalie by hooting in a tree overhead, and then several wood-pigeons cooed mournfully their sad good-nights.</p>

<p>The road was full of turnings, and wound in and out among the wood. Toby whistled a tune as he went along, and Rosalie sat and listened to him, quite glad that he broke the silence. She was not sorry when they left the wood behind and came into the open country. And at last there glimmered in the distance the lights of a village, where Toby said they would spend the night. He pulled up the caravan by the wayside, and begged a bed for himself in a barn belonging to one of the small village farms.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday. Such a calm, quiet day, the very air seemed restful. The country children were just going to the Sunday school as the caravan started.</p>

<p>Their mothers had carefully dressed them in their best clothes, and were watching them down the village street.</p>

<p>The sick woman had had a restless and tiring night. Little Rosalie had watched beside her, and was weary and sad. Her poor mother had tossed from side to side of her bed and could find no position in which she was comfortable. Again and again the child altered her mother&#8217;s pillow, and tried to make her more easy; but though the poor woman thanked her very gently, not many minutes had passed before she wanted to be moved again.</p>

<p>But the Sunday stillness seemed to have a soothing effect on the sick woman. And as they left the village she fell asleep.</p>

<p>For hours that sleep lasted, and when she awoke she seemed refreshed and rested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rosalie darling,&#8221; she said, calling her little girl to her side, &#8220;I&#8217;ve had such a beautiful dream!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it, Mummy dear?&#8221; asked Rosalie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I was looking into heaven, Rosalie dear, in between the bars of the golden gates; and I saw all the people dressed in white walking up and down the streets of the city. And then somebody seemed to call them together, and they all went in one direction, and there was a beautiful sound of singing and joy, as if they had heard some good news. One of them passed close to the gate where I was standing, Rosalie, and he looked so happy and glad, as he was hastening on to join the others. So I called him, darling, and asked him what was going on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did he say, Mummy dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said, &#8216;It&#8217;s the Good Shepherd who has called us; He wants us to rejoice with Him; He has just found one of the lost sheep, which He has been seeking so long. Did not you hear His voice just now, when He called us all together? didn&#8217;t you hear Him saying, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+15%3A6" title="Luke 15:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 15:6)</span></a></span>?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then they all began to sing again, and somehow I knew they were singing for me, and that I was the sheep that was found. And then I was so glad that I awoke with joy! And, oh, Rosalie darling, I know my dream was true, for I&#8217;ve been asking Him to find me again and again, and I&#8217;m quite sure that He wanted to do it, long before I asked Him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mummy dear,&#8221; said Rosalie, putting her hand in her mother&#8217;s, &#8220;I <i>am</i> so glad!&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosalie&#8217;s mother did not talk any more then; but she lay very quietly, holding Rosalie&#8217;s hand, and every now and then she smiled, as if the music of the heavenly song were still in her ears, and as if she still heard the Good Shepherd saying, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Then they passed through another village, where the bells were ringing for afternoon service, and the sick woman listened to them very sorrowfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall never go to church again, Rosalie darling,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mummy,&#8221; said little Rosalie, &#8220;don&#8217;t talk like that! When you get better, we&#8217;ll go together. We could easily slip into the back seats, where nobody would see us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Rosalie,&#8221; said her mother. &#8220;You may go, my darling, but <i>I</i> never shall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not, Mummy dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rosalie,&#8221; said her mother, raising herself in bed and putting her arm round her child, &#8220;don&#8217;t you know that I am going to leave you? Don&#8217;t you know that in about a week&#8217;s time you will have no mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosalie hid her face in her mother&#8217;s pillow and sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mummy, Mummy dear!&#8212;Mummy, don&#8217;t say that! please don&#8217;t say that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s true, little Rosalie,&#8221; said her mother; &#8220;and I want you to know it. I don&#8217;t want it to take you by surprise. And now stop crying, darling, for I want to talk to you a bit; I want to tell you some things while I can speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;My poor, poor darling!&#8221; said the mother, as the child continued sobbing.</p>

<p>She stroked her little girl&#8217;s head very gently; and after a long, long time the sobbing ceased, and Rosalie only cried quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little woman,&#8221; said her mother, &#8220;can you listen to me now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosalie pressed her mother&#8217;s hand, but she could not answer her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rosalie, darling, you won&#8217;t be sorry for your mother, will you, dear? The Good Shepherd has found me, and I&#8217;m going to see Him. I&#8217;m going to see Him, and thank Him, darling; you mustn&#8217;t cry for me. And I want to tell you what to do when I&#8217;m dead. I&#8217;ve asked your father to let you leave the caravan, and live in some country village. But he won&#8217;t give his consent, darling; he says he can&#8217;t spare you. So, dear, you must keep very quiet. Sit in the caravan and read your little Testament by yourself; don&#8217;t go wandering about the fair, darling. I&#8217;ve been asking the Good Shepherd to take care of you. I told Him you would soon be a little motherless lamb, with nobody to look after you, and I asked Him to put you in His bosom and carry you along. And I believe He will, Rosalie dear; I don&#8217;t think He&#8217;ll let you get wrong. But you must ask Him yourself, my darling; you must never let a day pass without asking Him: promise your mother, Rosalie&#8212;let her hear you say the words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mummy dear,&#8221; said Rosalie, &#8220;I promise you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if ever you can go to your Aunt Lucy, you must go to her and give her that letter&#8212;you remember where it is&#8212;and tell her, dear, that I shall see her someday in that city I dreamt about. I should never have seen her if it had not been for the Shepherd&#8217;s love. But He took such pains to find me, and He wouldn&#8217;t give it up, and at last He put me on His shoulders and carried me home. I am very tired, Rosalie darling, but there is more that I wanted to say. I wanted to tell you that it will not do for you to ask your father about going to your Aunt Lucy, because he would never let you, and he would only be writing to her for money if he knew where she lived. I don&#8217;t know how you&#8217;ll be able to go to her,&#8221; said the poor woman sadly, &#8220;but God will find you a way. I believe you will get there someday. I can&#8217;t talk any more now, darling, I am so tired! Kiss me, my own little woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosalie lifted up a very white and sorrowful face, and kissed her mother passionately.</p>

<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t sing your little hymn, could you, darling?&#8221; said the sick woman.</p>

<p>Rosalie tried her very best to sing it, but her voice trembled so that she could not manage it. She struggled through the first verse, but in the second she quite broke down, and burst into a fresh flood of tears. Her poor mother tried to soothe her, but was too weak and weary to do more than stroke the child&#8217;s face with her thin, wasted hand, and whisper in her ear a few words of love.</p>

<p>Very sorrowful were poor Rosalie&#8217;s thoughts as she sat by her mother&#8217;s bed. She had known before that her mother was very ill, and sometimes she had been afraid as she thought of the future. But she had never before heard that dreadful fear put into words; she had never before known that it was not merely a fear, but a terrible reality. &#8220;In about a week&#8217;s time you will have no mother.&#8221; That was what her mother had told her.</p>

<p>And her mother was everything to Rosalie. She had never known a father&#8217;s love or care; Augustus had never acted as a father to her. But her mother&#8212;her mother had been everything to her, from the day she was born until now. Rosalie could not imagine what the world would be like without her mother. She could hardly fancy herself living when her mother was dead. She would have no one to speak to her, no one to care for her, no one to love her.</p>

<p class="verse">Words of love Thy voice is speaking,
<br />&#8220;Come, come to Me.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Come_Come_to_Me/index.html" title="Come, Come to Me">*</a></p>

<p>What was it made her think of that just now? Was it not the Good Shepherd&#8217;s voice, as He held the poor lonely lamb closer to His bosom?</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Come, come to Me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Shepherd, I <i>do</i> come,&#8221; said little, weary Rosalie. &#8220;I come to Thee now!&#8221;</p>
