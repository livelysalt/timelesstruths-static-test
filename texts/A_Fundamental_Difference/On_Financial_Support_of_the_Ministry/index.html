<h1>On Financial Support of the Ministry</h1>

<p>And now we come to the last subject of difference between us that we will write upon at this time, as we do not want to make this writing too lengthy. And we are perfectly willing to let the Word settle the question under consideration, for we know that when we come to the judgment, we will not be judged by the tradition of men, but by the Word of God, and we do not want to go beyond it, neither fall short of it, for no doubt to do either would be equally hurtful and wrong.</p>

<p>Now, under the law of Moses, there was a legal system of financial support, and heavy penalties were inflicted on the transgressor. But all who have the knowledge of the Word know that Jesus, by His death on the cross, abolished the entire law system. Therefore no part of it was carried over into the gospel dispensation, and hence no part of it is binding upon the children of God today; and to teach men and women that they ought to give ten percent, or any exact amount, is to go back under the law and bind upon people what Christ has destroyed in His death. The Trumpet people teach a certain definite system of their own make&#8212;holding that neither Christ nor the apostles had any certain system of financing the work of God. In this we differ, for we believe that the New Testament teaches a definite system of finance; and that Christ and the apostles both preached and practiced it; and since this is the case, it is both wrong and unnecessary to create a financial system of our own liking.</p>

<p>Now, we will give you the Word of God upon the financial system, as taught by Christ and the apostles.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+12%3A5-6" title="John 12:5-6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 12:5-6)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him. For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+13%3A28-29" title="John 13:28-29"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 13:28-29)</span></a></span> Now we see by the above scriptures, that Christ and His disciples had a purse, or &#8220;bag&#8221; which held the money which they had. We see also that this money was used to purchase the things they had need of, and also to use in helping the poor. Further, we see that Judas, one of their number, was their treasurer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; one may ask, &#8220;where did they get the money which was the common fund, and out of which they supplied themselves and the poor? Did Christ teach the people that they had to give a certain percent of their income unto Him and His?&#8221;</p>

<p>If He did, there is no record of it in the New Testament. But we do read where Paul said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;I have showed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how that he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+20%3A35" title="Acts 20:35"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 20:35)</span></a></span> So from this we infer that Christ taught people to give.</p>

<p>&#8220;But where,&#8221; you ask, &#8220;did the money come from which Judas carried in the &#8216;bag&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>We read again, <span class="scripture">&#8220;And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him, And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils, And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod&#8217;s steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+8%3A1-3" title="Luke 8:1-3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 8:1-3)</span></a></span> Praise the Lord.</p>

<p>Here we see how Jesus was supplied with the necessary means to carry on His ministry. So, we can say without fear of successful contradiction, that Christ taught the glad tidings of the kingdom of God throughout every city and village, and as He taught them and healed their sick, the people were made to realize the truth that <span class="scripture">&#8220;The labourer is worthy of his reward&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+5%3A18" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 5:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 5:18)</span></a></span>; hence, <span class="scripture">&#8220;certain women with many others ministered unto him of their substance.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Thus we see the system that Christ inaugurated was a system of freewill. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Freely ye have received, freely give,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+10%3A8" title="Matthew 10:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 10:8)</span></a></span> and we do not hesitate to say that thirty years&#8217; experience in the Evening Light Reformation has taught the ministry and saints that the system of freewill has been very successful in spreading the gospel to almost all the nations of the earth.</p>

<p>Now, we desire next to see how the church at Jerusalem, which was the beginning of the divinely organized church on earth, carried on their financial affairs. For Christ, at the time of His ascension, commanded the disciples to tarry at Jerusalem and <span class="scripture">&#8220;wait for the promise of the Father,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+1%3A4" title="Acts 1:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 1:4)</span></a></span> which was the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire, by which they were organized into the church of the living God. Of their number at that time, we read that they were an hundred and twenty, together with one accord, waiting for the baptism of the Spirit, and that when that day fully came, they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and spoke with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance; and thousands cried out, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Men and brethren, what shall we do?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+2%3A37" title="Acts 2:37"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 2:37)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them [the original one hundred twenty] about three thousand souls. And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles. And all that believed were together, and had all things common; And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need. And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+2%3A41-47" title="Acts 2:41-47"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 2:41-47)</span></a></span> Also, this was a daily ministry, as is recorded in the <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=sixth+chapter+of+Acts">sixth chapter of Acts</a>; and when the number of believers were greatly multiplied, seven men were ordained by the apostles, who were given charge of the freewill offering system of supplying the needs of the work.</p>

<p>Now, dear reader, do you see how this same system, which Christ employed to finance His work, was employed by His apostles? They did not take the church for money, but they freely gave the gospel in the power of God. And they that gladly received it did not have to be taxed or harnessed with a legal system of giving in order to get them to do their duty, for the burning love of God in their hearts caused them, when they saw their brother in need, to sell their possessions and come and lay it at the apostles&#8217; feet, and distribution was made <span class="scripture">&#8220;unto every man according as he had need.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+4%3A35" title="Acts 4:35"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 4:35)</span></a></span> And we further declare on the authority of God&#8217;s Word, that that is the way the apostles preached and practiced it as they went everywhere preaching the gospel, even among the Gentiles. We read further, of Paul who was shipwrecked on the island of Miletus among the barbarous people, where he preached Christ, and healed the sick. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And when we departed, they loaded us with such things as were necessary.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+28%3A10" title="Acts 28:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 28:10)</span></a></span> Also, when Paul taught gospel giving, he taught it as the freewill of the people, not <span class="scripture">&#8220;of necessity,&#8221;</span> but willingly, <span class="scripture">&#8220;for God loveth a cheerful giver.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+9%3A7" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 9:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 9:7)</span></a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; says one, &#8220;but did not the Lord ordain that they that preach the gospel should live of the gospel?&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, indeed He did, and would you like to know when and where he ordained it thus? Then, turn to <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+10">Matthew 10</a>, and find where Christ commissioned His twelve disciples to go preach. There he tells them what to preach and how to live while they are preaching: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Provide [get] neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+10%3A9-10" title="Matthew 10:9-10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 10:9-10)</span></a></span> Again we read of Christ sending other seventy to preach, and He tells them in regard to their financial support, <span class="scripture">&#8220;And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house&#8230;. And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+10%3A5%2C7" title="Luke 10:5,7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 10:5,7)</span></a></span> So you see, dear reader, how and where the Lord ordained that they who preach the gospel shall live of the gospel. And you may search the New Testament in vain to find where God has authorized His preachers to bind a legal system of finance upon His people.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; says one, &#8220;but did not Paul teach the Purpose Plan?&#8221;</p>

<p>Let us see if he did, and if so, to what extent. Paul taught the Corinthians in regard to the ministers of Christ, that they were <span class="scripture">&#8220;not [to] muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+5%3A18" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 5:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 5:18)</span></a></span> and that the Lord ordained that the people among whom His ministers labored were to support them by freewill offerings. Then also, in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+8+and+9">II&nbsp;Corinthians 8 and 9</a>, he said he had no commandment from the Lord for them; but he gave his advice, how that they should make up a bounty to send to the poor saints at Jerusalem, and in order that everything be in readiness when he came to gather their gift, he advised them as he had the churches of Galatia, namely, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthans+16%3A2" title="I&nbsp;Corinthans 16:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthans 16:2)</span></a></span> and that <span class="scripture">&#8220;as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+9%3A7" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 9:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 9:7)</span></a></span> This is the simple truth of the whole affair, and never again do we read of Paul or any other minister of that age, telling the saints to lay by them in store upon the first day of the week. Thus you see there was no system other than the system of freewill, as is so plainly taught in the Word. Hence, the Trumpet system of purposing a definite amount to be paid at stated periods of time, and having the sect envelope way, is only human, sectish, and without authority in the Holy Scripture.</p>

<p>Before we conclude this we wish to record the testimony of some who worked in the early part of the Reformation, and see how they understood, that God would have them do in regard to finance, and you will see by such how the Trumpet people have departed from their own past teaching, as well as from the truth in this matter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Today we are saved to the uttermost and filled with the love and glory of God. Not a sin upon earth has any dominion over us; we are free! hallelujah! We live by the Word of God. We believe it all, and enjoy it. We as a family living economically do not use alcohol, tobacco, or medicines; no pearls or jewels or gold; no braids or ruffles or laces; no plumed hats; but dress common and clean and comfortable, and eat common and healthful articles of food. We preach from three to nine times a week, but receive no salary, nor take up any collections. We have all we need, and are just as happy and contented as we could wish to be, and all because God is our salvation.</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[Palmer, A. B.; <i>Nineteen Hundred Years of Church History</i>, pp. 415]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>Now, dear reader, we could multiply testimonies like the above, to show how the early ministers of the Evening Light Reformation understood, taught, and practiced the Word of God on all these points, but we believe this sufficient to help you see the difference between the people of the Church of God and The Gospel Trumpet people, who, although they once preached and practiced the whole truth, have in these last days let down the standard of the gospel, have compromised with this world and sectism, and are teaching for doctrines the commandments of men, and we believe that every person whose conscience is not seared will be enabled by this to see the right way of the Lord and truth, and be persuaded to walk therein and find rest to their souls. Amen.</p>
