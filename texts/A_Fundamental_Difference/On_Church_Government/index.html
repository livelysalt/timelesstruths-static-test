<h1>On Church Government</h1>

<p>Now we come to the third point of difference between us, namely, church government. We wish to take this up from a scriptural standpoint and set forth the truth in the matter. We have seen that the Church of God is divine, and that God Himself is her builder, maker, and sole organizer. So, also, we find that the government of His church is unlike any other government, political or ecclesiastical. We read in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+9%3A6-7">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>, <span class="scripture">&#8220;For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end&#8230;&#8203;to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> of hosts will perform this.&#8221;</span> Again, <span class="scripture">&#8220;And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+1%3A18-19" title="Colossians 1:18-19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 1:18-19)</span></a></span> Now we see by the above scriptures, that Jesus Christ was ordained of God to be the head and governor of His church, and nowhere in the Bible do we find that anyone was to be chosen to be equal with Him in rule or authority in His church. But we do read in the second Thessalonian letter, of the <span class="scripture">&#8220;man of sin&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Thessalonians+2%3A3" title="II&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:3)</span></a></span> who would exalt himself to the headship of the church, and this no doubt refers to the Pope of Rome; but God declares that He will destroy him at the second coming of Christ.</p>

<p>But although Christ is the governor if His church, He has officers through whom He governs His people. So, we read, <span class="scripture">&#8220;But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+4%3A7-8" title="Ephesians 4:7-8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 4:7-8)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;And he gave some, apostles [planters]; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;q=And he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers " title=""><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> ()</span></a></span> One may ask, &#8220;For what purpose did He give them?&#8221; Hear the answer: <span class="scripture">&#8220;For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body [church] of Christ&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+4%3A12" title="Ephesians 4:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 4:12)</span></a></span>; <span class="scripture">&#8220;And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+12%3A28" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 12:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 12:28)</span></a></span>; etc. Now we see that the officers of this church are divinely appointed, even by the Lord Himself. So there is no school or college of bishops in the church, to appoint the officers their work; no great ones in this church; no class ministry; none above another. Every preacher is called of God, qualified by the Holy Ghost and sent forth by Him into the particular place where the Spirit pleases. Accordingly we read, <span class="scripture">&#8220;But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+20%3A25-27" title="Matthew 20:25-27"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 20:25-27)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Here we see the humble equality of the ministry as taught by Christ Himself. In the government of the Gentiles, there were degrees; there were petty officers, and above them all was the Emperor. But Christ said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;It shall not be so among you.&#8221;</span> All were equal in authority in the ministry; all received the same commission. Their field was the world, and they were to go when and where the Holy Ghost might send them. The history of the labors of the apostles shows this very plainly. And to show you how this has been taught among us, we quote D. S. Warner in <i>The Cleansing of the Sanctuary</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Her government is divine, not only in the legislative, as we have just seen, but likewise, in its judicial and executive departments. <span class="scripture">&#8220;The government shall rest upon his shoulder.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+9%3A6" title="Isaiah 9:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 9:6)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;He is the head of the body the church&#8230;&#8203;that in all things he might have the preeminence&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+1%3A18" title="Colossians 1:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 1:18)</span></a></span>; a divine government in the highest sense; a theocracy not only appointed by God, but administered by Him; even <span class="scripture">&#8220;one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+4%3A6" title="Ephesians 4:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 4:6)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;It is the same God which worketh all in all.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+12%3A6" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 12:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 12:6)</span></a></span> He chooses men for elders and deacons, as <span class="scripture">&#8220;helps [and] governments&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+12%3A28" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 12:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 12:28)</span></a></span>; but these, as well as all the members of the body, have no right or power to act, except as <span class="scripture">&#8220;it is God which worketh in [them].&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+2%3A13" title="Philippians 2:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 2:13)</span></a></span> If, therefore, they teach or exhort, it is by His Spirit dwelling in them. So her government is indeed all divine; yea, it is indeed a government of God, working all things in all the members.</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[Warner, Daniel S.; <i>The Cleansing of the Sanctuary</i>]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>Now the Trumpet people teach contrary to this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">A minister is as much the servant of the church as he is the servant of God, and he should not feel free to go where he pleases and undertake any work in any place on his own responsibility or leadings. We may call following such unsystematic and disorderly methods being led by the Spirit and sent by the Holy Ghost. The result will always prove that such leadings are mostly human notions that waste means, times, and lives, and often work great havoc in the churches. Let the brethren as well as the Lord send you, and if they do not think you are qualified for the work you think of undertaking, God will not hold you responsible for not doing it.</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[<i>Ministerial Letter</i> June 1, 1915]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>Now, dear reader, you see by the above, that they would set up, or establish, a college, or board of &#8220;brethren,&#8221; to question your leadings of the Spirit, and to pass upon the same, and to tell you whether or not you could go here or there to preach Christ&#8217;s gospel. And if they, the &#8220;brethren,&#8221; tell you not to go where you feel the Lord leading you to go, God will not hold you responsible for not doing the work He led you to do. Can you think for a minute that such teaching is in keeping with the Word? Such is nothing less than pleasing man, and where, pray tell me, in the Word of God has He given men dominion over your faith, and over your understanding when or where Christ sends you to work for Him? Search the scriptures and see how God calls and sends His ministers independently of any earth-born Council, Synod, College, or Board. Take, for example, the ministers of the early church. Christ sent the first ones forth without human straps or bands to <span class="scripture">&#8220;Go&#8230;&#8203;teach all nations,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+28%3A19" title="Matthew 28:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 28:19)</span></a></span> with no One to answer to but the <span class="scripture">&#8220;great shepherd of the sheep.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+13%3A20" title="Hebrews 13:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 13:20)</span></a></span> A little later He saved Saul of Tarsus. See how He commissioned him; here are his words: <span class="scripture">&#8220;But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ&#8230;. But when it pleased God [not the brethren], who separated me from my mother&#8217;s womb, and called me [not the brethren] by his grace, To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me [the apostles at Jerusalem were called to preach before he was]; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+1%3A11-17" title="Galatians 1:11-17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 1:11-17)</span></a></span> And this same Paul says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+11%3A1" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 11:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 11:1)</span></a></span> A good example for preachers now.</p>

<p>The Ministerial Letter quoted above stands contrary to the Word of God on this subject. It calls God&#8217;s divine system of government wasteful of means, time, and lives; also destructive. But it is plain to be seen that such men are blinded with he false doctrines of sectism, and have departed from <span class="scripture">&#8220;the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jude+1%3A3" title="Jude 1:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jude 1:3)</span></a></span> Therefore, they are left to their own human reasoning; and they build their own human organizations and try to impose them upon the Church of God, pretending that they are scriptural. But thank God for a Holy Bible and Spirit which will teach His children the true doctrine. <span class="scripture">&#8220;The meek will he guide in judgment; and the meek will he teach his way.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+25%3A9" title="Psalm 25:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 25:9)</span></a></span> Amen.</p>
