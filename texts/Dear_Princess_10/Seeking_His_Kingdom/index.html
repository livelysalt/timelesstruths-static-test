<h1>Seeking His Kingdom</h1>

<h2>Meet a Princess: Esther Joy Pinzur</h2>
<hr class="minor" />
<h2>Please tell us about yourself, your goals, and your values.</h2>
<p>Greetings in the name of the Savior! My name is Esther Joy Pinzur. I am seventeen; my birthday is May 25th. I am the second of nine children. I cannot imagine living in a small family. There are times I would like to have less people in the family (like on Sunday morning&#8212;we have one bathroom), but I never give anyone up, unless God took him. Schoolwork absorbs much of my time. My favorite subjects are algebra and history (I am studying United States history from the Bob Jones University Press textbook). I do not like writing, which is because I am still learning how to be a thinker, writing must be preceded by thought. Teaching myself to play hymns on the piano was a challenge. Advice from Mom and my older brother along the way was invaluable. I like playing but I still need to work on accompanying people singing. I am studying Spanish, using the Learnables. Hebrew is hard, but I enjoy working on it, although I do not have a lot of time to spend on it. Teaching phonics and math to Bethany (age 8) for the last few years has been a helpful learning experience for me. I handle food at our house&#8212;planning, preparation, and often shopping. I look forward to learning how to <i>grow</i> food this year. The highest aim of my life is to love the Lord my God with all my heart, soul, mind, and strength. I want to seek first His kingdom and righteousness. My desire is that in every action I will be serving Him, for no man can serve two masters. My life will bring glory to God if each moment is lived for Him.</p>

<h2>Please tell us about your family.</h2>
<p>Daddy (Art) and Mommy (Juanita) were married in Massachusetts on June 24th, 1978. Nine months later (March &#8217;79) Abraham Paul was born in Concord, New Hampshire. (We use the Hebrew pronunciation of Abraham, Ov-ra-hom, and call him Av, pronounced Ov, for short.) I came along two years after my big brother, while my parents were living in Bensalem, Pennsylvania. When I was three months old, we moved to northeastern Illinois. Three years later, Joseph Timothy was born (August 1985). Joanna Lily (December &#8217;88), Bethany Ruth (August &#8217;90), Samuel Luke (March &#8217;92), and Jonathan Mark (November &#8217;93) came all in a rush. Our eighth baby, Joyful Victory, was miscarried in March of 1995. God gave us joy with the coming of Ezra John on February 14, 1996. In May of the following year, we moved to Sherman, Texas. January 2nd, 1998, was the day of Moses Stanley&#8217;s birth (his middle name is after my maternal grandpa). We relocated again in July, 1998, this time to Hartsville, a small town in the beautiful rolling hills of middle Tennessee. Daddy is working in the Customer Service department of the Rock-Tenn facility in Gallatin, Tennessee. This division of Rock-Tenn makes corrugated boxes and displays. Daddy has a good sense of humor, and can keep us all rolling. He is the best accent imitator in the world, our favorite is his combination of Southern and Chinese accents. Daddy has a servant spirit, and is always willing to do the undesirable thing. Mommy works full-time as a professional mother. Since we have never been in school away from home, she has been teaching for the pest fifteen years. On top of that she manages laundry, cleaning, and all the other things that keep a home running.</p>

<p>Mom has had rheumatoid arthritis for almost twenty years, so she is not able to minister to her family as much as she would like to be able to do. Although she grows discouraged at times, she has a strong confidence in God; she knows He will do what is best for her family. Mommy is careful to honor Daddy in all she says and does. Av (20) has been working for one of our church elders who has a land surveying business; his job occupies most of his time. Computers have been one of Av&#8217;s hobbies for a long time; he taught himself most of what he knows about them. He has also taught himself some mechanics. He does hands-on things, like putting a new cylinder head in his car. Just like Mommy&#8217;s father, be is not afraid to try doing things he has never done before. There is almost always something being turned over in Av&#8217;s mind, although we never know quite what it is. I am sometimes amazed at his analytical abilities. My brother is the best older brother. He likes me; I like him.</p>

<p>Joseph (13) has found several new interests since we moved to Tennessee. Our only neighbors, a family from our church, have goats, cows, and chickens. For some reason, Joseph and Mr. Gregory became fast friends. Joseph has learned a lot about animals and gardening. (One of the best gardeners in the area happens to be Mr. Gregory.) Usually Joseph&#8217;s work is done diligently. His free time is mostly spent playing sports, helping Mr. Gregory, or playing with his younger brothers.</p>

<p>Next in line is Joanna (10). Joanna is our musician. She is learning to read music now, but she has been playing the piano &#8220;by ear&#8221; for a long time. Many skills are being learned as she helps with laundry, cooking, baby care, and other household duties. Any available reading material is devoured by Joanna. Her somewhat amazing memory is put to work on many Scripture verses. She desires to become more like Christ.</p>

<p>Our &#8220;baby&#8221; girl, Bethany (8), is a bouncy one! She is usually cheerful as she works at her school and chores. Holding babies is one of Bethany&#8217;s favorite things to do. She has a soft spot in her heart for &#8220;Baby Mo,&#8221; and tries to stop his crying in every legitimate way. Like Joanna, she memorizes much Scripture, though she has to work harder at it. Whenever someone needs help, Bethany is there. Her example inspires me.</p>

<p>Samuel (7) is the first of four boys in a row. He enjoys playing with both his older and younger brothers. Drawing is Samuel&#8217;s specialty, along with Bethany. Pardon my bias&#8212;they are talented! Mom has been working with Samuel on reading for a while, and he is making good progress. Clearing the table after breakfast and putting laundry in the dryer are a couple of Samuel&#8217;s responsibilities. Jonathan likes it when he can help his brother with his chores. Samuel is also diligent in working on his memory verses.</p>

<p>Our seventh child is Jonathan (5). I asked Jonathan what he likes to do. His list included playing games, going outside when it is sunny, playing basketball, jumping on a trampoline, and playing with Lego blocks. He is good friends with Ezra; the two years between them are insignificant. Helping the big people with their work gives Jonathan pleasure; I think it helps him know he is a valuable part of the family.</p>

<p>After losing Joyful, we did not take Ezra&#8217;s life for granted; he is our precious treasure. The first &#8220;E&#8221; after me, I am glad that we share middle initials, too. Ezzie tries to act just like his brothers&#8212;a fact which we use to exhort them to proper behavior. Now that Ez is three, he is exhibiting some of those typical two-year-old traits. (He is one of the quieter type, and it took him a while to realize that he could resist authority.) We pray for God&#8217;s grace, that we might be able to teach him that submission is always best.</p>

<p>Moses is our youngest for now. He is the most intense baby I have ever known. One minute he will be screaming in joy,and the next, crying in anger. This presents a challenge in training him. We love our little treasure, though. Our prayer is that one day his passion will be used for God&#8217;s glory.</p>

<h2>Could you share with us a spiritual lesson God has or is teaching you?</h2>
<p>God is constantly working on me. Let me share one thing of importance. I am beginning to realize that if I fail to do my part in making my mom and dad successful each day, I have not been successful that day. Woman was created to be a helper to man. As daughters, we are to support our moms and dads. The wife is told to submit to her husband. The wife&#8217;s goals should be one with her husband&#8217;s. There are many things we want to do, but it is essential that we realize that crossing off every item on our to-do list is not the most important thing to accomplish. What Daddy wants done is what must be done. I try to ask Daddy every morning if there is something I can do for him. Often it is something small, like making sure a card gets in the mail. It can be more of a challenge to serve Mommy. When I finally finish my work, I want to be able to do the things I need to do, but do not have to do. However, if Mom has something she did not get done at that time, or if she needs me to do something before I get done with my work, it is more important to do her thing than my thing. I still struggle to find the proper balance between fulfilling my responsibilities and not being selfish with my time.</p>

<p>This whole outlook is a challenge to maintain. If I finish everything I wanted to do, I feel successful. By God&#8217;s grace, I will learn that true success is found in the success of those I am serving.</p>

<p>One of our elders, Pastor Carroll, has a land surveying business. The success of his business is not surprising when you watch his wife, Mrs. Linda. Setting aside personal ambitions, she works day in and day out for her husband. In my eyes, and I think in God&#8217;s, her life up till now is a success, because her husband has succeeded.</p>

<h2>Could you share with us a hard time which the Lord used to refine you?</h2>
<p>After seven normal pregnancies, Mom&#8217;s miscarriage in March of 1995 was a shock to all of us. God alone kept me through that time, because I felt like giving up on Him, but I never did. I kept believing Him when I felt no reason to do so. Looking back at this experience has given me assurance that my faith is not dependent on me; if it was, I would certainly be lost. The Lord Jesus is the Author and Finisher of my faith. I am kept by His power, not my effort.</p>

<p>The Lord used Joyful&#8217;s death as He often does in a family; we came to appreciate one another to a greater degree after experiencing death. We also gained the ability to enter into the sorrows of others. Death causes us to long for our eternal home.</p>

<h2>Would you mind sharing a favorite book, poem, or recipe?</h2>
<p>In the days following the miscarriage, the Lord comforted me with the words of Lina Sandell Berg (1832-1903), a young woman who knew the pain of losing her precious father in an unexpected accident.</p>

<h2><a href="../../../music/Day_by_Day/index.html" title="Day by Day">Day by Day</a></h2>
<p class="verse">Day by day, and with each passing moment,
<br />Strength I find, to meet my trials here;
<br />Trusting in my Father&#8217;s wise bestowment,
<br />I&#8217;ve no cause for worry or for fear.
<br />He Whose heart is kind beyond all measure
<br />Gives unto each day what He deems best—
<br />Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure,
<br />Mingling toil with peace and rest.</p>

<p class="verse">Every day, the Lord Himself is near me
<br />With a special mercy for each hour;
<br />All my cares He fain would bear, and cheer me,
<br />He Whose Name is Counselor and Power;
<br />The protection of His child and treasure
<br />Is a charge that on Himself He laid;
<br />&#8220;As thy days, thy strength shall be in measure,&#8221;
<br />This the pledge to me He made.</p>

<p class="verse">Help me then in every tribulation
<br />So to trust Thy promises, O Lord,
<br />That I lose not faith&#8217;s sweet consolation
<br />Offered me within Thy holy Word.
<br />Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,
<br />Ever to take, as from a father&#8217;s hand,
<br />One by one, the days, the moments fleeting,
<br />Till I reach the promised land.</p>

<h2>In conclusion, is there anything else you would like to add?</h2>
<p>Thank you, Skye and Abigail, for giving me the opportunity to write this. I pray that it, as well as every other aspect of my life, will encourage everyone that comes contact with it to <span class="scripture">&#8220;look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+4%3A18" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 4:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 4:18)</span></a></span></p>
