<h1>From the Hearts of Our Readers</h1>

<hr class="minor" />
<p class="noindent">Dear Skye and Abigail,</p>

<p>Greetings to you both!</p>

<p>Thank you very much for sending me DP! I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t write sooner. I enjoyed reading it very much. I think it&#8217;s just wonderful that you are trusting God to support this ministry. I believe that if a magazine is truly a work of God, it will succeed (without subscription rates!). Amen?! [Yes!&#8212;Ed.]</p>

<p>My family has actually been home churching for about three years (I think I said two in my last letter). On Sundays just my family has church together&#8212;Daddy, Mama, me, Elisabeth, Tori, Joanna and Nathanael. We sing hymns, which we all enjoy very much, take communion, and listen to a tape by one of the &#8220;old time&#8221; preachers like T. Austin Sparks, A. W. Tozer, Leonard Ravenhill, and Paris Riedhead. We have really enjoyed having church at home. The Lord has also used this time of little fellowship to strengthen us and draw us close to Him. We all have learned many valuable and sometimes hard lessons. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A28" title="Romans 8:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 8:28)</span></a></span> Right now we do fellowship with one other family, not on Sundays. They are attending a church and are not looking to leave. We are like-minded in some areas. We are really enjoying the fellowship of this family.</p>

<p>I enjoyed both of your letters. Abigail, even though you&#8217;re a younger publisher than those of other magazines, I appreciated what you had to say&#8212;we need to give all glory and be fully surrendered to Him. The latter has really been on my heart lately. Skye, you&#8217;re definitely not the only one who struggles to get out of bed in the morning! I struggle with that, too. Although I&#8217;m usually able to get ready for the day quickly enough to have my quiet time, it&#8217;s the point. After a good night&#8217;s rest, getting up should be a piece of cake! But our flesh gets in the way. This is definitely an area we need to seek God about and just mortify our flesh! His grace is always there for us. And when we think of all that He has done for us, getting up to spend just a few minutes with Him is absolutely nothing! It should be an honor to spend time &#8220;repaying&#8221; Him the debt we owe. <span class="scripture">&#8220;O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+63%3A1" title="Psalm 63:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 63:1)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+8%3A17" title="Proverbs 8:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 8:17)</span></a></span> Do you set an alarm? Also, try getting ready first&#8212;dress, brush hair, etc. before praying. I&#8217;ve found this helps me wake up better so I can really focus on my prayer time.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always enjoyed the &#8220;Meet&#8230;&#8203;&#8221; sections. Amy&#8217;s comment, &#8220;when I completely &#8216;turnover&#8217; to God everything I have&#8230;&#8203;little things&#8230;&#8203;and big things&#8230;&#8203;what freedom, what joy comes!&#8221; was a blessing. It&#8217;s an encouragement to know others are dealing with many of the same issues.</p>

<p>I also enjoyed the letters. It seemed like everyone really enjoyed &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Pikas_Treasure/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Pika's Treasure">Pika&#8217;s Treasure&#8212;What About Mine?</a>&#8221; Could you please send me all of your back issues? I&#8217;m very anxious to read this article and also &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Seek_Him_Early/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Seek Him Early">Seek Him Early</a>,&#8221; by E. M. Bounds.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to reading what subscribers have to say about &#8220;Dresses vs. Pants.&#8221; My mom, sister, and I wanted to send in something for it, but weren&#8217;t able to get anything together before the deadline. For about six years now, my family has been dressing modestly&#8230;. Before we started home churching, we attended a &#8220;sister&#8221; church of Charity Christian Fellowship in Pennsylvania. During the thee years we were there, we learned so many things that we didn&#8217;t even know were in the Bible. Things such as separation from the world (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+12%3A2">Romans 12:2</a>), holy living (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+12">Hebrews 12</a>), and dressing modestly (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A3">I&nbsp;Peter 3:3</a>), to name a few. We have enjoyed dressing modestly very much. There have been many occasions that people have approached us asking if we were Amish or Mennonite. We then are able to tell them that we aren&#8217;t Amish or Mennonite, but are just Christians trying to follow the Word of God. It&#8217;s been a blessing to be able to share our faith.</p>

<p>I have a question about Laura&#8217;s article. God knows everything about us. So how can He be our confidant? To me, a confidant is someone you tell your secrets to. We can&#8217;t have any secrets kept from God. He knows us better than we know ourselves. <span class="scripture">&#8220;O L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, thou hast searched me, and known me. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, thou knowest it altogether. Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it. Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?&#8230;&#8203;I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+139%3A1-7%2C14" title="Psalm 139:1-7,14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 139:1-7,14)</span></a></span></p>

<p>I appreciated the poem very much. These days, the phase, &#8220;What Would Jesus Do?&#8221; seems to be popular in the contemporary Christian world. This thought shouldn&#8217;t just be a trend, but a heart matter. If we&#8217;re truly serving and loving God, all that we do will be to His honor and glory. And we won&#8217;t be ashamed of our actions.</p>

<p>I also enjoyed reading &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_7/I_Will_Never_Leave_Thee_Nor_Forsake_Thee/index.html" title="Dear Princess 7/I Will Never Leave Thee Nor Forsake Thee">I Will Never Leave Thee Nor Forsake Thee</a>&#8221; by Heather Eley. This is a very touching story. It is wonderful to see how God taught this family to trust Him during this difficult time. May all of us always have this kind of faith and trust in Him, no matter what our circumstances may be. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Trust in the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+3%3A5-6" title="Proverbs 3:5-6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 3:5-6)</span></a></span>&nbsp;&#8221;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_7/A_Bible_Lesson/index.html" title="Dear Princess 7/A Bible Lesson">A Bible Lesson</a>,&#8221; by Jenny C. Rutty, on trusting God was also a blessing.</p>

<p>Jessica Dorfsmith&#8217;s drawings are beautiful! She has quite a talent!</p>

<p>Thank you again for sending me <i>DP</i>. It&#8217;s wonderful to see a magazine centered on the things of God&#8212;those that are eternal. I&#8217;ve come across many that are about things that are temporal. <span class="scripture">&#8220;While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+4%3A18" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 4:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 4:18)</span></a></span> Keep up the good work! God bless you as you endeavor to do His will!</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p class="noindent">Dear Stephanie,</p>

<p>In response to your question, &#8220;How God can be our Confidant when He already knows everything about us?&#8221; I would like to bring up the thought of our will and ability to choose. God gave us each a free will that we may seek Him or not. Many scriptures refer to this decision: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Who is on the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>&#8217;s side? let him come unto me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Exodus+32%3A26" title="Exodus 32:26"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Exodus 32:26)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+30%3A19" title="Deuteronomy 30:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Deuteronomy 30:19)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;Choose you this day whom ye will serve.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Joshua+24%3A15" title="Joshua 24:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Joshua 24:15)</span></a></span></p>

<p>God has a standard to be met before we can be accepted of Him, but since He desires only a voluntary love, He never forces us to meet that standard&#8212;only calls out in mercy that we might be saved. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Seek ye the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+55%3A6-7" title="Isaiah 55:6-7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 55:6-7)</span></a></span> Therefore, though He knows us altogether, we can&#8217;t know Him, His love, power, or friendship until we meet the requirements and forsake all sin. <span class="scripture">&#8220;The L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+34%3A18" title="Psalm 34:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 34:18)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;The L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+145%3A18" title="Psalm 145:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 145:18)</span></a></span></p>

<p>It is when we choose God&#8217;s way and are received of Him that we can reap the benefits He has for all His children. One of those benefits is having Him for our closest Confidant. It is our choice to receive the blessing of His closeness, the blessing which He has held out all along to those who will seek it. Enoch and Noah <span class="scripture">&#8220;walked with God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+5%3A24%3B++6%3A9" title="Genesis 5:24;  6:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 5:24;  6:9)</span></a></span> Abraham was called <span class="scripture">&#8220;the Friend of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+2%3A23" title="James 2:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 2:23)</span></a></span> David chose Him to be his Counselor, Guide, and Friend and reaped the benefits: <span class="scripture">&#8220;I have set the Lord always before me: because He is at my right hand, I shall never be moved.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+16%3A8" title="Psalm 16:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 16:8)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee&#8230;&#8203;To see thy power and thy glory&#8230;. Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee&#8230;. Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice. My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+63%3A1-3%2C7-8" title="Psalm 63:1-3,7-8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 63:1-3,7-8)</span></a></span></p>

<p>There is a good illustration in the story of Mary and Martha (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+10%3A38-42">Luke 10:38-42</a>). Jesus was near to both of them, desired to commune and teach them both, to be their cloest friend, but they each responded differently. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+10%3A42" title="Luke 10:42"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 10:42)</span></a></span> Jesus said when Martha came to Him in vexation. Mary had chosen to draw close to Jesus, to really know Him and find the peace His presence brought. Though Martha had the same opportunity, she focused instead on the cares of the home, in serving where she thought was necessary. Yes, Jesus knew all about her, but she wasn&#8217;t experiencing the blessing and peace of confiding and abiding in Him. She needed to lay all those cares and worries at His feet and learn of Him, discover His way of rest for her soul, and take Him as her closest Confidant.</p>

<p>Finally, to address the thought of the Lord being One to confide in. Yes, we won&#8217;t be confiding or telling anything He doesn&#8217;t already know (and most completely, too), but it brings Him pleasure for us to take the action of going to Him. If we think of it in terms of how we relate to our parents, this truth may become more apparent. Oftentimes they notice many things about us and our day, but it is when we take the time to confide these things to them ourselves that a close relationship can be built.</p>

<p>I hope these thoughts are helpful to you. If they do not answer your question satisfactorily, please let me know. May the Lord&#8217;s way be exalted and His name be glorified.</p>

<p>Dear Miss Abigail:</p>

<p>I am a busy mother of four young, home-educated children. Recently I have experienced great anguish and torment due to a trial of my heart, which included other people. I did not feel free to discuss this situation with anyone due to the integrity of my heart. I sought comfort in God and my understanding husband. Still I longed for comfort in a friend.</p>

<p>While busy with my day today I received the mail and with it came the new edition of <i>Dear Princess</i>. I felt a stirring in my heart to take time to read it&#8230;&#8203;and soon. God provided the moment not long afterward, and as I read your editorial my heart and my eyes began to weep with comfort. I find it moving when Solomon said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;There is nothing new under the sun,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ecclesiastes+1%3A9" title="Ecclesiastes 1:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ecclesiastes 1:9)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New International Version">NIV</span> he was speaking true wisdom. Whether you are young or old, the enemy of a peaceful heart is still the wily temptation Satan brings to be offended and to defend ourselves. I found it comforting all the more to know that others struggle, too, and there is virtue at the end. It isn&#8217;t as if I haven&#8217;t had a trial of the heart before. Each time it is a greater opportunity to respond quickly with love and an open heart, while my flesh wants to hide away and live in the shame of the accusation. I am thankful that the word of God is true and though many say and do evil, God Himself will never leave us or forsake us, and we are to take comfort in that. The fear of man brings a snare but the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Oh, how we need that wisdom! I don&#8217;t mean to ramble. I just wanted to share this with you while it was fresh in my heart; God used your story and your magazine for His glory today, and He was the lifter of my head through your open and transparent heart.</p>

<p>Thank you and God bless you.</p>

<p class="signature">With affection,<br />A sister in Christ</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Author/Publishers of Dear Princess Magazine,</p>

<p>A few days ago I received my first issue of <i>Kindred Spirits</i> (which happens to be the last issue). I read Skye Erickson&#8217;s article and was blessed. (Though I couldn&#8217;t figure out which one she was in the photo!)</p>

<p>When looking through the magazine recommendations, I realized that <i>Dear Princess</i> might be the &#8220;small magazine&#8221; Miss Erickson co-edits, so, with my mother&#8217;s permission, I am writing to ask for you to put me on the mailing list.</p>

<p>Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Sarah Knecht; I am 16 years old and the oldest of 7 (soon to be 8). The name of your magazine caught my eye because my name means &#8220;princess.&#8221; My last name means &#8220;servant&#8221; in German, and the combined meanings are such a source of inspiration to me!</p>

<p>The dear Lord knew me as I was being <span class="scripture">&#8220;curiously wrought&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+139%3A15" title="Psalm 139:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 139:15)</span></a></span> and picked me, or should I say, bestowed on me a name of His own choosing, for which I am grateful. I can completely trust that &#8220;Jesus doeth all things well&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/All_the_Way_My_Savior_Leads_Me/index.html" title="All the Way My Savior Leads Me">*</a> as the hymn says.</p>

<p>I live here in Tampa, Florida as I have lived for the past 6 years. We moved here in 1992 to be near a military hospital because my Dad (who was in the military) was injured in an Army training mission. His brain injury resulted in the paralyzation of his left arm and leg. Though his eye (left one) is blind and he walks with a limp, God spared him to us with the full use of his brain and speech.</p>

<p>God has led our family through so much, it would take a book to tell it all though I can say this: He is always faithful. We thank God for Dad&#8217;s injury because now he can stay home and train us up in the way we should go. Dad works hard to instill in us the importance of character in our lives and I believe his faithfulness to his family and responsibility has paid off as lam learning to love the Lord God with all my heart, soul, mind and strength.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time and effort.</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Skye and Abigail,</p>

<p>Hello! Praise our blessed Lord! I just finished reading my first issue of the <i>DP</i>, which was the <a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_7/index.html" title="Dear Princess 7">Fall 1998</a> issue, and I also just received my <a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_8/index.html" title="Dear Princess 8">Winter issue</a> in the mail. Before this I had never even heard of <i>DP</i>, and what a great magazine I&#8217;ve been missing out on! I thank God that my friend, Julie Brill, told me about it! I really enjoyed the fall issue and look forward to reading this new one! My heart-felt sympathy goes out to Heather Eley; may the Lord comfort her heart with all His name comforts, and her family also.</p>

<p>Your story, Skye, about the printer and how you hadn&#8217;t prayed and asked God first, was a blessing to my family, as we were reading something in Joshua very similar to your story. Things didn&#8217;t go well for Joshua because he hadn&#8217;t prayed. I know God was trying to impress upon us the importance of asking <i>every</i> time before we do <i>anything</i>. Joshua had to pay the consequence; praise the Lord for His mercy in your case. He knows we make mistakes, and is ever merciful to us! I enjoyed Amy Zander&#8217;s interview also!</p>

<p>God bless you and thank you for your magazine!</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Skye, Abigail, and all you other dear princesses,</p>

<p>Hello! My name is Andrea Pratt and I&#8217;m a new subscriber to <i>Dear Princess</i>. I received my winter issue of <i>DP</i> and finished it within two days; I liked it so much. It is such a blessing to me. Though it is similar to <i>HopeChest</i>, it is also different and unique and wonderful in its own special way. I can&#8217;t wait till get the next issue.</p>

<p>Abigail, I especially liked your editorial about not explaining ourselves over every little thing. That is not one of my strong points I&#8217;m afraid and so often I wish to clear the air, let everyone know I&#8217;m not the one who did it, or that&#8217;s not what I mean when I said that, etc. Like you said, if one tries to correct the talebearer of what really happened or was said, they don&#8217;t believe you and &#8220;strife ensues.&#8221; A lot of the little arguments that happen daily probably could be avoided if more people let go of their rights to having their name cleared and just keep quiet.</p>

<p>Only today I was reading in <i>The Genesis Record</i> by Henry M. Morris about Joseph and Potiphar&#8217;s wife. I quote, &#8220;There is no indication that they were utterly untrue, and he was being punished unjustly, he still kept quiet&#8230;. Joseph opened not his mouth, thus demonstrating one of the most difficult, most Christlike-traits of character for a Christian to develop.&#8221;</p>

<p>In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+53%3A7">Isaiah 53:7</a> it says: <span class="scripture">&#8220;He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.&#8221;</span> And <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+2%3A19-23">I&nbsp;Peter 2:19-23</a> says: <span class="scripture">&#8220;For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully. For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Like Jesus&#8212;our prime example&#8212;we should not worry about our rights, but rather concern ourselves with helping towards establishing a peaceful home. Let us remember to commit ourselves to Him that judgeth righteously.</p>

<p>I enjoyed all of this winter&#8217;s issue of <i>Dear Princess</i>. It was a blessing to me. Amy Molinero, I enjoyed your <a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_8/From_the_Hearts_of_Our_Readers/index.html" title="Dear Princess 8/From the Hearts of Our Readers">letter</a>. It appears as though you and I are quite the same. What I mean by that is that I have been trying to rise earlier, walk daily, have a better prayer time each and every day and throughout each and everyday, and to just be myself; myself is all I can truly be.</p>

<p>The rest of the magazine was very interesting. I especially liked &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_8/Fruit_of_Her_Hands/index.html" title="Dear Princess 8/Fruit of Her Hands">Fruit of Her Hands</a>.&#8221; We don&#8217;t yet have all the ingredients for the bread recipe, but I hope to get it soon. We have been largely brought up on store-bought bread and have only recently found a recipe that all like and that is good for everything from French toast to peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. If Buttermilk-Oat Bread is another to my family&#8217;s liking, we shall have two and then we won&#8217;t get sick of the same thing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d better sign off now. God bless you all in Christ.</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Skye,</p>

<p>Hi! My name is Anna Ragan and I&#8217;m a subscriber to <i>Dear Princess</i>. I just wanted to thank you for the wonderful work that you and Abigail are doing! I have been touched by the wonderful stories and testimonies in the magazine!</p>

<p>I just received my second issue of <i>Dear Princess</i> and loved it! I especially enjoyed the poem, &#8220;Thank You for the Valley.&#8221; I had come across that poem a few months ago, but couldn&#8217;t find it anywhere. Imagine how surprised I was to find it in the magazine!</p>

<p>I also enjoyed your article, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_8/Count_it_All_Joy/index.html" title="Dear Princess 8/Count it All Joy">Count it All Joy</a>.&#8221; I have really been struggling with expressing joy to others in my life. One of my favorite verses is <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+5%3A16">I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:16</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Be joyful always.&#8221;</span><span class="script_ver" title="New International Version">NIV</span> But lately, I have been having a hard time being joyful. But I tried your suggestion of singing a song, and it really cheered me up!</p>

<p>Keep up the good work and may God bless you as you continue to bless others!</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Abigail and Skye,</p>

<p>Thank you so much for allowing God to use you in this wonderful way. Abigail, your testimony was inspiring and beautiful. Skye, I read in <i>HopeChest</i>, about your desire to be emotionally and spiritually &#8220;married&#8221; to the Lord. That is wonderful. An older sister in the Lord shared with me that same thing a while ago. I want that, too. It is so important to keep our eyes on Jesus during these waiting years, and focus first on being <i>His</i> bride.</p>

<p>In the last issue, Holly Hageman submitted the poem, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_8/Wait/index.html" title="Dear Princess 8/Wait">Wait</a>.&#8221; That poem has been used by the Lord in an incredible way. I would like to share with you and all the <i>DP</i> readers an amazing story, to the glory of God.</p>

<p>My mom has a friend whose nephew has leukemia. He was rushed to the hospital unconscious and suffered two strokes and his organs were starting to shut down. This precious boy is only three years old. His family are Christians; by faith they were standing on God&#8217;s promises in His written word and His word revealed to their hearts. They knew their little boy would be healed. Many from the church were gathered around his hospital bed praying when he sat up and said he was hungry and would like pancakes. Praise be to the Lord! The doctors said he would die; it was only a matter of time. But Praise Him, our God is bigger than all that, isn&#8217;t He?! A prayer warrior was given April 18, a significant date for their family, as the day of his complete healing. Please pray!</p>

<p>This is where I get to the poem. My mother and sister and I really liked it and my mom gave a copy of it to her friend (whose nephew is in the hospital). She gave it to her brother and sister-in-law and it so encouraged them that they hung it on the wall of their son&#8217;s hospital room! (In St. Louis, Missouri.)</p>

<p>Many from the church who came to pray have seen the poem and asked for a copy. They made a whole stack of copies and are handing them out to whoever wants one! We are continuing to share it with others. Thank you so much, Holly, for submitting that! Isn&#8217;t it incredible what God can do when we are obedient to Him?</p>

<p>The story, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_8/Tell_What_the_Lord_Has_Done_for_You/index.html" title="Dear Princess 8/Tell What the Lord Has Done for You">Marvelously Healed</a>&#8221; was an awesome testimony. Thank you! We are sharing that with others. Thanks again and God bless you!</p>

<p class="noindent">Dearest Skye,</p>

<p>Yesterday I received the unexpectedly early (as I thought) issue of Dear Princess! I was so happy to receive it, and tried to fold laundry and read it at the same time (not a progressive endeavor). I was so glad to see that it seemed the theme of this issue was going through trials and sufferings victoriously (did you and Abigail do this intentionally&#8212;or did the Lord speak to all the writers about the same thing at the same time?); because I had requested <i>DP</i> not too long ago for a friend who is going through a great trial. Isn&#8217;t it amazing how the Lord works out things? [No, it was not intentional, Sarah. The Lord just brought together articles on that theme which was also encouraging to us. &#8212;Ed.]</p>

<p>Well, I have some wonderful news! The Lord has been enabling me to <b>run to Him immediately</b> when the devil showers me with temptations to think wrongly. Through these many opportunities to stretch forth my hands unto Him for strength to overcome the world, the flesh, and the devil, I have literally sensed Him planting my feet much more firmly on the Rock of Ages. I&#8217;ve also noticed that since I&#8217;ve been enabled to read my Bible in the morning nearly every day for the last few weeks, I&#8217;ve sensed the Lord&#8217;s presence so much more and have been able, through His grace, to leave Satan for <i>Him</i> to fight and turn my mind immediately on Him or a <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+4%3A8">Philippians 4:8</a> thought. I was really helped by my Mom&#8217;s illustration, so I&#8217;d like to share it with you. She said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Sarah, <i>all</i> the devil wants to do to you is to get you off the Lord&#8217;s path. He doesn&#8217;t care how he does it&#8212;all he cares about is if he&#8217;s successful. Now picture yourself walking on the Lord&#8217;s path joyfully. All of a sudden, Satan throws a dead rat at you (a sinful thought), and instead of turning your eyes at once to the Goal, and continue steadily walking toward it, without paying any attention to the dead rat, you start in on introspection. &#8220;How could this thought have entered my mind. Where did it come from?&#8221; Then you step off the path to investigate it, and Satan is delighted. He starts playing with your mind like a cat would toss and torture a mouse by asking you these introspective questions, and you get so horrified, looking at your weaknesses&#8230;&#8203;instead of on <i>Christ</i> who is <span class="scripture">&#8220;able even to subdue all things unto himself,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+3%3A21" title="Philippians 3:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 3:21)</span></a></span> that you sink into despair, worry, and you &#8220;chase your tail&#8221; beside the path until your hair falls out because of stress. Another way the devil gets you off the path is by placing a candy-coated dead rat under your nose. Your flesh loves the aroma and instead of looking to <i>Christ</i> to overcome your flesh and looking to <i>Him</i>, you trust in your own strength, and your flesh drags you off the path to indulge in sinful pleasure. Suddenly, you see where you&#8217;ve fallen and the devil pours despair over you, and instead of immediately looking to Christ, praying&#8230;&#8203;pleading His forgiveness and getting back on the path (and staying there!), you let the devil &#8220;throw&#8221; all your sins that he dragged up from the sea into your face, and allow Him to rob you of the view of Calvary, a blood-drenched cross, and a smitten Savior, and all the joy Christ has for you if you accept <span class="scripture">&#8220;his unspeakable gift.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+9%3A15" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 9:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 9:15)</span></a></span></p>

</blockquote>


<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever.

<p class="noindent">Dear Abigail and Skye,</p>

<p>I just wanted to thank you for all a the effort put into the <i>Dear Princess</i> magazine. The articles are so applicable to everyday life, with their emphasis on character and devotion to the Lord.</p>

<p>I was introduced to <i>Dear Princess</i> by little girl that I nanny. Her mother mentored me in the ways of the Lord, and taught me homemaking skills.</p>

<p>I currently live in Charlotte, NC, where I attend Bible and nursing school. I hope to use my nursing skills overseas as a missionary.</p>

<p>The teachings in <i>Dear Princess</i> have the same principles as what was taught me by my dear friend and mentor. I am so encouraged by the articles, as they reaffirm many Godly truths by which I am trying to model my life. Blessings to you and your families!</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;I was a stricken deer that left the herd
<br />Long since: with many an arrow deeply infixed
<br />My panting side was charged, when I withdrew
<br />To seek a tranquil death in distant shades.
<br />There was I found by One who had Himself
<br />Been hurt by the archers. In His side He bore
<br />And in His hands and feet the cruel scars.
<br />With gentle force, soliciting the darts,
<br />He drew them forth, and healed, and bade me live.&#8221;</p>

<p>This poem, written by the dear friend of Fanny Crosby, William Cowper, in his book, <i>The Task: Book III</i>, has captivated my thoughts since I read it this afternoon in the book, <i>In His Image</i>. It took on a special meaning to me as for my 15th birthday in January, I received a hawthorn character bow with two arrows. Slowly I am learning to use it. I know just how powerful the bow can be, and how deep the arrows do penetrate! Praise Him, we never have to endure more than He did!</p>

<p>In your editorial, Abigail, you quoted, <span class="scripture">&#8220;[Charity] seeketh not her own.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthias+13%3A5" title="I&nbsp;Corinthias 13:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthias 13:5)</span></a></span> The Lord taught me the meaning of this verse about a year ago, and if ever I slip back into the old thought pattern, the Holy Spirit says, &#8220;Ahem&#8230;&#8203;Sylvia? Remember, &#8216;Charity seeketh not&#8230;.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221; I am sure you all understand when I make the assumption that most of you who are reading this homeschool, have certain standards, truly make the Lord your whole focus, dress modestly, etc. So it is for me, but I was pretty legalistic about it, and had a real holier-than-thou attitude. It was at my church, my best and closest friends, and even in my homeschool group. It got to the point where anyone who did not homeschool with ATI, dress modestly, believe in courtship, go to the &#8220;proper&#8221; church&#8212;I really condemned them! Now this may come as a bit of a shock to you, but I was even developing a critical spirit to some of you who get <i>DP</i> and other magazines, all because you weren&#8217;t like me!</p>

<p>When I had to memorize 1 Corinthians 13 for Sunday School, the Lord really spoke to me. He said, &#8220;My daughter, you have not been glorifying My name through your spirit. I love you, not because of who you are, or because you are good, but because who <i>I am</i>. You have been shunning those who are My children, and this is wrong. Even those who are not Mine, you should be seeking to help them and show them Myself!&#8221;</p>

<p>Talk about a slap in the face! It was hard, but my Heavenly Father has told me that I shouldn&#8217;t restrict my &#8220;association&#8221; to those exactly of like mind. &#8220;Don&#8217;t seek <i>your</i> own. Seek those who are My own. And those who are not Mine, you have to help them.&#8221; Even now I still tend to be very critical, but I am trying to conquer these faults. Praise God from whom all blessings flow, who gives us life and strength!</p>

<p class="noindent">Dearest Sisters in the Lord,</p>

<p>Blessed, oh, we are blessed by our Faithful Father! My first issue of <i>Dear Princess</i> arrived this morning, a ray of sunshine in the dreary, rainy day. At first, I had not the time to read each article in depth, but merely glanced over it to become acquainted with you all. Later this evening, after a day of sewing, I perched, tailor-fashion atop my bed and read testimony after testimony of the workings of God in your lives. I feel such a kinship with you, for I see how similar our trials and victories are! I, too, am beginning to realize what peace comes in yielding to His will; being totally, completely submitted. The awesome thing is that <b>He knows best</b>! Though I try to be submitted to His will, I become tempted to think God is there to fulfill all my wishes, give me the desires of my heart. Something quoted by Israel Wayne in <i>Kindred Spirits</i> magazine helped me to realize what, in fact, was occurring in me, again and again. He said, &#8220;I was reading a book and came across a quote by the missionary, E. Stanley Jones: &#8216;If I throw out a boat hook from the boat and catch hold of the shore and pull, do I pull the shore to me, or do I pull myself to the shore? <i>Prayer is not pulling God to my will, but the aligning of my will to the will of God.</i>&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221; (Emphasis added.) I became aware that I was trusting, not in God&#8217;s sovereign will, but rather in my own ideas of what His will was. I had come to a standstill in my relationship with God because of my mistrust. Conviction weighed upon my heart, because deep in my soul, I knew He knew best, but my heart found it difficult, if not impossible to trust Him. Many times, over the next week, I turned to Him in prayer, I imploring Him to help me be obedient to His will, even though I felt it would be contrary to my own way of thinking. He has, He has! Monday, the answer came, and it was indeed a &#8216;No.&#8217; After four years of not knowing His will in the matter, to knowing without a doubt, is such a relief. Though I have surrendered my own will, I feel so free, so much peace in His; I feel prepared to walk ahead with Him, unafraid of the battles I may face, confident that He will make His will perfected in me.</p>

<p>Thank you so very, very, very much for sending me your magazine, <i>Dear Princess</i>. Mommy and I enjoyed it very much! I enjoy reading magazines that are based on Biblical principles.</p>

<p>I will tell you some about our family. The members of my family are: David (Daddy), Dianne (Mommy), Matthew (11), and Luke (5). My name is Ruth Anna Scott and I am 13 years old, my birth date is January 15, 1986. My family and I lived in Colorado until October 7, 1994, when we came here to Indianapolis&#8230;. We own an acre of land in Cedaredge, Colorado, about an hour away from Grand Junction, and we are building a house there. During the summer we go back to Colorado and work on our house.</p>

<p>While I was writing you a letter, a girl called about a violin. Our family has been looking for a violin for me for about a month or two. Every violin we have seen was not good enough to buy, when we went to buy, and the one we saw that was good enough to buy, couldn&#8217;t be found when we went to go see it. I was getting very frustrated and finally gave up my right to have a violin. It was a struggle at first to yield my rights to Him, but by His grace I did! I decided that the Lord did not want me to have a violin, at least for right now.</p>

<p>Our family (Daddy) called an answering machine, and no one ever called back from there about a violin. While I was writing this letter to you, we got a phone call. It was from a girl, the one who we had called on the answering machine. She said she was willing to sell it for $300. Our family went down to her house, about an hour away, and Mrs. Yeadon (a violin teacher) went with us to look at it. The violin was full sized, and German made, exactly what we had been looking for. We had been asking the Lord that if it was His will, He would give us a full-size violin, German-made, in His time. Mrs. Yeadon looked at it, and told us it was a very good violin. Daddy bought it, with some money from some chairs I had helped him upholster. Praise the Lord! I waited patiently on Him, trusted in Him, and He provided in His time a very good violin, which also came with a bow, music stand, and nice violin case&#8212;for a good price! What a wonderful God we serve!</p>

<p>I will be praying for you. I thank God for allowing me to find out about your magazine, <i>Dear Princess</i>. The Lord bless you, as you serve Him faithfully and wholeheartedly.</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Skye and Abigail,</p>

<p>I so very much enjoyed my issue of <i>Dear Princess</i>&#8230;. Everything I read was so very encouraging and glorifying to the Lord&#8230;&#8203;the articles on modesty helped to confirm my own reasons for dressing as I do, in modest skirts and dresses, and it helped to know that I wasn&#8217;t the only one to face pride. However, rather than give up my own standards on clothing, I sought the Lord to humble me in His sight. (Some people will turn from the Narrow Path because of pride, rather than turn from pride itself.) I thank Him that He continues to diligently keep me humble.</p>

<p>May God richly bless you!</p>

<p>Greetings of love in Jesus&#8217; name! I enjoyed <i>Dear Princess</i> very much! I was encouraged to find so many like-minded young ladies in the modesty discussion. Perhaps I am a little late, but I personally agree that dresses or jumpers are the right thing to wear. In Florida, we don&#8217;t have a need for warm things under our dresses. I&#8217;m sharing with you a picture of our swimwear. The shirt is a bit below the knees. The baggy pant legs go down to our ankles. We also have a vest. Dorcas Ebersole sews most of our clothes, as we do not have a knack for sewing, and are quite busy.</p>

<p>Overall, thank you so much for sending me <i>Dear Princess</i>. I enjoyed it so much!</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>Thank you for all your encouragement. Your letters and notes are a ray of sunshine to us.</p>

<p>We wanted to share with you a prayer request. Recently, we received a phone call from a subscriber asking us to pray for the Lester family of Montezuma, Georgia. The day before the call, the oldest son had fallen from off the top of the log cabin he was helping build. He was taken immediately to the hospital, unconscious, and put on life support. The following day, they discovered he had passed away. The Lester family was very thankful to know that their son and brother was saved and is now in Heaven. Please pray for them as they go through this hard time. I know they would appreciate a note, letting them know you are praying for them. If you&#8217;d like to write, their address is: The Lester Family Rt. 1, Box 206 Montezuma, GA 31063</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
