<h1>Notes</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>In case you&#8217;re wondering why Stitches &#8217;N&#8217; Stories isn&#8217;t included, we would like to mention that it will be discontinued from these pages from now on. The need for this column is being sufficiently supplied by <i>Treasures of the Kingdom</i>, a new publication for children ages 5-10, put out by Laura Erickson (Skye&#8217;s older sister). In case you missed the letter we sent out with the last issue of <i>Dear Princess</i>, announcing <i>Treasures of the Kingdom</i>, and would like to be placed on its mailing list, you may write to Laura Erickson: Treasures of the Kingdom; P.O. Box 1212, Jefferson, OR 97352.</p>

<p>The Lord has been speaking to our hearts about a topic we&#8217;d like to feature in <i>Dear Princess</i> on &#8220;Standing Alone.&#8221; We need your help to supply godly, inspiring reading on this topic. We don&#8217;t want you to write if God has not given you anything to say, but if He has spoken to you about writing on the subject of standing alone in your convictions, or has brought you through a time when you stood atone in what God taught you, we would be interested in reading your article. At different times the Lord calls each one of us to &#8220;stand out and be different&#8221;&#8212;it is a refining process. Would you mind sharing what the Lord taught you during that time? Please send in your articles by August 31st, 1999, to be featured in the Fall &#8217;99 issue. We are sorry, we cannot take late articles. Thank you! We appreciated the response we received for our modesty discussion and hope to receive the same for this topic. We took forward to hearing from you soon!</p>

<p>Lastly, but certainly not least, we want to mention how much your prayers, your sweet letters and articles and kind free-will offerings mean to us. They are such encouragements to us and often answers to prayer. Thank you so much for being a blessing.</p>

<p class="signature">In the service of the Master,<br />Abigail and Skye</p>

<h1>With Love, from the Editresses</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>Through the intervening months when we published the spring issue, a poem, &#8220;Through Sunshine and Shadow,&#8221; has been on my heart to share with you. As I tried to write an editorial this season, as is our custom, the Lord just did not give us words to write, but brought this poem again to mind. We trust it will prove a blessing to you, as it has been so encouraging to me.</p>

<h2>Through Sunshine and Shadow</h2>
<p class="verse">I beheld the King in His beauty,
<br />In His glorious majesty shine;
<br />He held out the golden scepter,
<br />I knelt in His presence Divine.
<br />My soul was filled with emotion,
<br />As upward I glanced as He smiled,
<br />And said in tender compassion,
<br />&#8220;What is thy request, My child?&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">My lips could no longer be silent,
<br />My heart its longing outpoured,
<br />O Savior! I want to be like Thee&#8212;
<br />No other request have I, Lord&#8212;
<br />I want to love Thee supremely,
<br />My heart, filled with Thy praise,
<br />More tender, gentle, and loving,
<br />The fallen I might he1p raise.</p>

<p class="verse">More sympathy for the discouraged,
<br />More love for Thy children, too,
<br />I long to be filled with Thy Spirit,
<br />This heart of mine flowing through.
<br />Not I; but only Thou, Lord,
<br />Shine through my life each day,
<br />Leading the wanderer back to the stream,
<br />That washes all sin away.</p>

<p class="verse">I read in the Word that Jesus,
<br />The debt for sin had paid,
<br />There on Calvary&#8217;s mountain
<br />The sacrifice had been made.
<br />&#8220;It is finished,&#8221; said Christ, my Redeemer,
<br />And I need no longer to wait,
<br />That I might have life &#8220;more abundant,&#8221;
<br />He suffered without the gate.</p>

<p class="verse">One night in the dear old chapel,
<br />With the saints of God so near
<br />I knelt at the cross of Jesus,
<br />The place to me most dear.
<br />I tarried there for power,
<br />Of the Holy Ghost above,
<br />Who carried my soul on the billows,
<br />Of that boundless ocean of love.</p>

<p class="verse">I had made my reconsecration,
<br />Of all I knew to give,
<br />When the Spirit sweetly whispered,
<br />&#8220;This parcel wilt thou receive?&#8221;
<br />I looked and behold, &#8217;twas from Jesus,
<br />&#8220;Your Future,&#8221; He said to me;
<br />From my heart &#8216;rose an &#8220;Amen, Jesus,
<br />I give it <i>all</i> to Thee.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">I looked at the parcel He gave me,
<br />And saw &#8217;twas &#8220;Instructions Sealed,&#8221;
<br />And only as I should need them,
<br />Would their contents be revealed.
<br />There surely would be some surprises,
<br />As I open them one by one,
<br />But I&#8217;ve given my all to Jesus,
<br />Saying, &#8220;Thy will be done.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">As my all was laid on the altar,
<br />The fire of Heaven came down;
<br />The Holy Ghost filled the temple,
<br />My heart was no longer my own.
<br />I went on my way rejoicing,
<br />As happy as mortal could be,
<br />No thorns did I find in my pathway,
<br />Though roses were blooming for me.</p>

<p class="verse">So charmed was I with my treasure,
<br />My heart was singing all day;
<br />Unseen by me were the storm clouds,
<br />That were hovering over my way.
<br />The skies had been gathering blackness:
<br />Shadows were growing deep,
<br />I found some thorns in my pathway,
<br />And the road was rough and steep.</p>

<p class="verse">Then, in the lowering darkness,
<br />I knelt a moment to pray,
<br />&#8220;O! Precious, loving Savior,
<br />Can it be that I have lost my way?
<br />Surely I&#8217;ve wandered from Thee,
<br />Thy way cannot be so hard.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">My heart was filled with sadness,
<br />And my body was racked with pain,
<br />For affliction had fastened upon me,
<br />And life seemed all in vain.
<br />I prayed that this cup of sorrow
<br />From me might pass away;
<br />Yet&#8212;only Thy will, my Savior,
<br />With me, Lord, have Thy way.</p>

<p class="verse">I prayed, but the heavens were silent,
<br />No answer to me was given,
<br />But ere I became discouraged,
<br />I heard a voice so loving;
<br />I listened and, lo! &#8217;twas Jesus,
<br />In tones so sweet and mild,
<br />Said, &#8220;Open the parcel I gave thee,
<br />Take courage, My trusting child.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">My strength was renewed like the eagles
<br />Though my eyes were dim,
<br />I read in the deepening twilight
<br />This message received from Him:
<br />&#8220;In the furnace of sore affliction,
<br />Behold I have chosen thee.
<br />From thy heart all dross must vanish,
<br />If My image I there would see.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">Like a dream the past came before me,
<br />I now remember my prayer,
<br />I had prayed to be like Jesus,
<br />His likeness I wanted to bear.
<br />Ah, yes! If I would be like Him,
<br />His suffering I, too, must share,
<br />For only he that endureth,
<br />A crown of glory shall wear.</p>

<p class="verse">So onward I&#8217;ll go <i>rejoicing</i>!
<br />I&#8217;ll trust where I cannot trace,
<br />His presence is ever with me,
<br />Though clouds may hide His face;
<br />Some day the veil will be lifted,
<br />Some day faith will be sight,
<br />By His grace&#8212;in those pearly mansions,
<br />I shall walk with Him in white.</p>

<p>Be encouraged, dear sisters, to yield all to the Lord and walk with Him fully on our life&#8217;s journey. Our prayers are with you and we appreciate yours in return.</p>

<p class="signature">With love in Him,<br />Abigail</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know what Kara said to &#8212;&#8212;? She said we <i>always</i> talk about getting married in our late night discussions!&#8221;</p>

<p>Laura recently informed me of the above, to which I simply grinned and shook my head. &#8217;Tis true, I must admit, to a certain extent; but not as exaggerated as it seems from what our 3rd sister said. Sporadically we lovingly and laughingly tease each other with, &#8220;Oh, I fear for your husband&#8230;&#8203;&#8221; or &#8220;I know what your children will be like!&#8221; Other times our talk will border on solemnity when we discuss the lessons that need learning or the weak areas to be strengthened. Yet more, we exhort each other to be consecrated and to delight in each new day the Lord gives us.</p>

<p>Okay, so it may seem like always? However, in reality the topic doesn&#8217;t come up on a daily basis, or even a weekly basis.</p>

<p>But can you guess how often it has occupied my <i>thoughts</i>, and I dare say the thoughts of my other two sisters?</p>

<p>It is to be expected, as we&#8217;re raised in a godly home with the principles of Biblical womanhood being taught us, along with the training for the next stage in life when, Lord willing, we shall fulfill the high and holy calling of motherhood.</p>

<p>It is to be even more anticipated, because we&#8217;re young ladies who are striving to obey our Master and His Word. And He&#8217;s called us, for the most part, to be women, in the greatest sense of the word <i>help meets</i>, mothers and home keepers.</p>

<p>Granted, there will be those whom He sees fit to keep single, for purposes that maybe He alone will know of. Yet there, too, will be sweet joy, because the Lord will be with them and be their complete Sufficiency.</p>

<p>Shortly before I came to Christ&#8212;almost three years ago&#8212;I was a very different young woman. I wore the attire of the world and my attitude and deportment were as becometh someone of the world. My mind was pretty much set for how my life would go: school, college to become a lawyer (in other words, to be financially well off), possibly marriage, but no children. Sad, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>When the love of God was shed abroad in my heart, everything changed. My old desires and ways were conformed to what God desired and His ways. Wrong and worldly attitudes were made pliable in His hands to change through time. (Old habits are hard to change overnight.) His standards became my standards and His will became my will. I no longer had the mind set or desires mentioned above.</p>

<p>Biblical womanhood quickly became my desire and purpose. I started to delight in the thought of being a keeper at home. And as the years went by and I turned 15, 16, 17, marriage and the next stage ahead occupied my thoughts quite frequently. I justified them to a certain extent, thinking these were natural desires. Yet God started speaking to me about something better&#8230;&#8203;for this stage in life.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, I have very few close friends outside the home. My family has become my closest friends, and I have a few close friends outside the family as well. Recently, my heart was saddened over the lost friendships that were once special and sweet. Many friends through the mail had either quit writing for lack of time or they were just not interested in writing anymore.</p>

<p>But Jesus, in the midst of my pondering and discouragement, said, &#8220;Skye, I will be your Friend.&#8221; Hadn&#8217;t I known this all along? Hadn&#8217;t Jesus been my Comfort and Stay through the trying scenes of life? Why, then, did I forget to think of Him as my Truest Friend? What kinder, more compassionate friend can I have?</p>

<p>We yearn for friends to share with and encourage and, later, husbands to be united with in life. Yet what about making Jesus our Best Friend and Closest Confidant? He has precious lessons for each one of us, if we&#8217;ll but take the time to sit lowly at His feet. Our Lord said of Mary, she <span class="scripture">&#8220;hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+10%3A42" title="Luke 10:42"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 10:42)</span></a></span> Will He say that of us, too?</p>

<p>In <i>The Christian&#8217;s Secret of a Happy Life</i> Hannah Whitall Smith says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">There are many relations in life which require from the different parties only very moderate degrees of devotion. We may have really pleasant friendships with one another, and yet spend a large part of our lives in separate interests, and widely differing pursuits. When together, we may greatly enjoy one another&#8217;s society, and find many congenial points; but separation is not any especial distress to us, and other and more intimate friendships do not interfere. There is not enough love between us, to give us either the right or the desire to enter into and share one another&#8217;s most private affairs. A certain degree of reserve and distance is the suitable thing, we feel. But there are other relations in life where all this is changed. The friendship becomes love. The two hearts give themselves to one another, to be no longer two but one. A union of souls takes place, which makes all that belongs to one the property of the other. Separate interests and separate paths in life are no longer possible. Things which were lawful before become unlawful now, because of the nearness of the tie that binds. The reserve and distance suitable to mere friendship becomes fatal in love. Love gives all, and must have all in return. The wishes of one become binding obligations to the other, and the deepest desire of each heart is, that it may know every secret wish or longing of the other, in order that it may fly on the wings of the wind to gratify it.</p>

<p>Ah! dear souls, if you have ever known this even for a few hours in any earthly relation; if you have ever loved a fellow human being enough to find sacrifice and service on their behalf a joy; if a whole-souled abandonment of your will to the will of another has ever gleamed across you as a blessed and longed-for privilege, or as a sweet and precious reality, then, by all the tender longing love of your heavenly Master, would I entreat you to let it be so towards God!</p>

<p>He loves you with more than the love of friendship. As a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so does He rejoice over you, and nothing but a full surrender will satisfy Him. He has given you all, and He asks for all in return. The slightest reserve will grieve Him to the heart. He spared not Himself, and how can you spare yourself? For your sake He poured out in a lavish abandonment all that He had, and for His sake you must pour out all that you have without stint or measure.</p>

<p>I think that perhaps we often forget Jesus really can be our Best Friend because we can&#8217;t have an audio/visual relationship, face to face. Yet He willingly condescends, yea even desires, to have a close, personal relationship with us. His actions prove it. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+15%3A13" title="John 15:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 15:13)</span></a></span></p>

<p>How willingly and lovingly Christ gave Himself for us, as His bride! This is a beautiful portrayal of a Christian&#8217;s life, especially for us young women who often dream of a husband to love and be loved by. Now is the time for us, who have been redeemed from a life of slavery to sin, to begin building a relationship with Jesus, as our rightful and heavenly Bridegroom. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+19%3A7" title="Revelation 19:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 19:7)</span></a></span></p>

<p>How can we build our relationship with our Heavenly Bridegroom?</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving&#8230;. For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+2%3A6-7%2C9-10" title="Colossians 2:6-7,9-10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 2:6-7,9-10)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Our Heavenly Bridegroom designed for us to find our &#8220;second half&#8221; in Him. Completeness in marriage is a blessing from God&#8212;when one part is gone, it is incomplete. Without Christ, <i>we</i> are incomplete, spiritually. <span class="scripture">&#8220;As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+15%3A4" title="John 15:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 15:4)</span></a></span> Jesus meant to fit in our lives to supply the places where we are lacking, and &#8220;success&#8221; will only come about by how well we build our relationship with Christ.</p>

<p>Just as a husband/wife relationship is built on trust, so our relationship with our Heavenly Bridegroom begins with trust. By trusting Him, we can learn to bring all our cares, fears, joys, and sorrows to Him. Trust is believing what we might not be able to actually see at the time, but what we know, from His promise, is to come. Trust is a vital key, for the Lord has made believing the condition of receiving. It is only when we trust the Lord that we can fully submit ourselves to Him and His perfect way.</p>

<p>Trust Him because He has promised to be our provider. Many of us seem to forget that, and act like a young bride trying to eke out something to survive on when her bridegroom owns the cattle on a thousand hills.</p>

<p>Someone related a story about a lady who struggled <i>every single morning</i> with trusting God. She&#8217;d worry and fret and struggle until at last she could rest in the Lord and give all her troubles over to Him. One day, someone asked her, &#8220;Sister, why don&#8217;t you just trust God in the first place?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Oh, I never thought of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>How many of us can honestly admit that we haven&#8217;t frequently done the same thing? Often we cling to our burdens and wrestle until we&#8217;re so wearied that we plunge it into God&#8217;s hands out of frustration. Yet Christ has promised to supply all our needs, to bear all our burdens, even to give us, as His bride what is best. Wouldn&#8217;t it be so much better just to trust Him first?</p>

<p>Take every burden and care quickly to Jesus. And don&#8217;t take them back again. Take that strength&#8212;our strength&#8212;which often seems us so mighty, yet we find so miserably weak, to Jesus. Let <i>Him</i> be your Strength, your Burden-bearer. He will willingly take our cares and troubles, if only we would submit ourselves, with perfect trust, into His hands. If we will do this, it will reduce our frustration and stress level down to zero and mightily increase our peace.</p>

<p>Trust comes forth out of love. Love is the key that binds heart to heart. Jesus loves us with a perfect love and desires to give us this fruit of the Spirit. It is by growing in the life of Christ, that unselfish Divine love, that we can truly live a life pleasing to Him. Let us deny ourselves, and follow after that charity which <span class="scripture">&#8220;suffereth long, and is kind&#8230;&#8203;envieth not&#8230;&#8203;vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+13%3A4-7" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 13:4-7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 13:4-7)</span></a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Love often hurts, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>I found myself saying that recently to someone who&#8217;s going through hard times and was sharing with me about her fears. Many of us, I believe, are prone to think of life&#8217;s worst. Once we get on this train of thought, the enemy very easily manages us into thinking, &#8220;what if this?&#8221; or, &#8220;what about that?&#8221; The devil will try his very hardest to plant doubts and fears in our mind. We need God&#8217;s perfect, trusting love, for <span class="scripture">&#8220;&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+4%3A18" title="I&nbsp;John 4:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 4:18)</span></a></span> When we have given ourselves completely into the keeping of our Heavenly Bridegroom, through love, there is no reason for us to fear and doubt Him.</p>

<p>In His faithfulness and perfect understanding of our needs, the Lord gives us trials and tests to beautify our souls. By allowing trials and afflictions, God is &#8220;spoiling us of what otherwise might have spoiled us.&#8221; &#8220;Afflictions make the heart more deep, more experimental, more knowing and profound, and so, more able to hold, to contain, and bear more.&#8221; &#8220;As out of Jesus&#8217; affliction came a new sense of God&#8217;s love and a new basis for love between men, so out of our affliction we may grasp the splendor of God&#8217;s love and how to love one another. Thus the consummation of the two commandments was on Golgotha and the Cross is, at once, their image and their fulfillment.&#8221; (Sir John Powell, John Bunyan, Malcolm Muggeridge.)</p>

<p>Out of great love and Divine understanding, does our Lord give us trials to refine and perfect us. Will we be faithful to return that love to Him? Will we count our trials more precious than gold or silver, which perish? Will we allow Him to have full reign within our hearts?</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;My beloved is mine, and I am his.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Song+2%3A16" title="Song 2:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Song 2:16)</span></a></span> By abiding in the Lord, finding our completeness in Him as the Bridegroom of our souls, we will experience the sweetest joy our souls have ever known. Let us not waste this precious time by allowing our hearts to wander to the dreams of the future. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Set your affections on things above.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+3%3A1" title="Colossians 3:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 3:1)</span></a></span> Fall in love with Jesus; you will never experience any greater earthly bliss!</p>

<h1>God&#8217;s Choice</h1>

<p class="author">Author Unkown</p>

<p>Every girl longs to give herself completely to someone, to have a deep relationship with another, to be loved thoroughly and completely and exclusively.</p>

<p>But to His child, the Lord says, &#8220;No, not until you are satisfied, fulfilled and content with being loved by Me, with giving yourself totally and unreservedly to Me, to have an intensely personal and unique relationship with Me alone, discovering that only in Me is your satisfaction to be found, will you be capable of the perfect human relationship with another. You will never be happily united with Me, exclusive of anyone else or anything else, exclusive of any other desire or longing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to <b>stop</b> planning, <b>stop</b> wishing, and allow <b>Me</b> to give you the most thrilling plans existing&#8212;ones that you cannot imagine. I want you to have the <b>best</b>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please allow <b>Me</b> to bring him to you. You just keep watching <b>Me</b>, expecting the <b>greatest</b>, keep experiencing the <b>greatest</b>, and keep experiencing the satisfaction that <b>I Am</b>&#8230;&#8203;keep listening and learning the things I tell you. <b>Just wait&#8230;&#8203;that&#8217;s all.</b> And when you are ready, I&#8217;ll surprise you with the love far more wonderful than <b>any</b> you would dream. You see, until you are ready, and until the one I have for you is ready&#8212;I&#8217;m working at this very moment to have one ready at the same time. Until you are both satisfied <b>exclusively</b> with <b>Me</b>, and the life I&#8217;ve given you, you won&#8217;t be able to experience the love that exemplifies your relationship with <b>Me</b>, and is then the &#8216;perfect love.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, Dear One, I want you to have the most and wonderful love. I want you in the flesh to have a picture of your relationship with Me and to enjoy <b>completely</b> the everlasting union of beauty, perfection, and love that <b>I offer you</b>. Know that I love you <b>utterly</b>. Believe it and be <b>satisfied</b>.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Sit Still, My Daughter!</h1>

<p class="author">J. Danson Smith</p>

<p class="verse">Sit still, my daughter! Just sit calmly still!
<br />Nor deem these days&#8212;these waiting days&#8212;as ill!
<br />The One who loves thee best, who plans thy way,
<br />Hath not forgotten thy great need today!
<br />And if He waits, &#8217;tis sure He waits to prove
<br />To thee, His tender child, His heart&#8217;s deep love.</p>

<p class="verse">Sit still, my daughter! Just sit calmly still!
<br />Thou longest much to know thy dear Lord&#8217;s will!
<br />While anxious thoughts would almost steal their way,
<br />Corrodingly within, because of His delay&#8212;
<br />Persuade thyself in simply faith to rest,
<br />That He, who knows and loves, will do the best.</p>

<p class="verse">Sit still, my daughter! Just sit calmly still!
<br />Nor move a step, not even one, until
<br />His way hath opened. Then, ah, then, how sweet!
<br />How glad thy heart, and then how swift thy feet!
<br />Thy inner being then, ah, then, how strong!
<br />And waiting days not counted then too long.</p>

<p class="verse">Sit still, my daughter! Just sit calmly still! 
<br />What higher service could&#8217;st thou for Him fill?
<br />&#8217;Tis hard! Ah, yes! But choicest things must cost!
<br />For lack of losing all how much is lost!
<br />&#8217;Tis hard, &#8217;tis true! But then&#8212;He giveth grace
<br />To count the hardest spot the sweetest place.</p>

<h1>Seeking His Kingdom</h1>

<h2>Meet a Princess: Esther Joy Pinzur</h2>
<hr class="minor" />
<h2>Please tell us about yourself, your goals, and your values.</h2>
<p>Greetings in the name of the Savior! My name is Esther Joy Pinzur. I am seventeen; my birthday is May 25th. I am the second of nine children. I cannot imagine living in a small family. There are times I would like to have less people in the family (like on Sunday morning&#8212;we have one bathroom), but I never give anyone up, unless God took him. Schoolwork absorbs much of my time. My favorite subjects are algebra and history (I am studying United States history from the Bob Jones University Press textbook). I do not like writing, which is because I am still learning how to be a thinker, writing must be preceded by thought. Teaching myself to play hymns on the piano was a challenge. Advice from Mom and my older brother along the way was invaluable. I like playing but I still need to work on accompanying people singing. I am studying Spanish, using the Learnables. Hebrew is hard, but I enjoy working on it, although I do not have a lot of time to spend on it. Teaching phonics and math to Bethany (age 8) for the last few years has been a helpful learning experience for me. I handle food at our house&#8212;planning, preparation, and often shopping. I look forward to learning how to <i>grow</i> food this year. The highest aim of my life is to love the Lord my God with all my heart, soul, mind, and strength. I want to seek first His kingdom and righteousness. My desire is that in every action I will be serving Him, for no man can serve two masters. My life will bring glory to God if each moment is lived for Him.</p>

<h2>Please tell us about your family.</h2>
<p>Daddy (Art) and Mommy (Juanita) were married in Massachusetts on June 24th, 1978. Nine months later (March &#8217;79) Abraham Paul was born in Concord, New Hampshire. (We use the Hebrew pronunciation of Abraham, Ov-ra-hom, and call him Av, pronounced Ov, for short.) I came along two years after my big brother, while my parents were living in Bensalem, Pennsylvania. When I was three months old, we moved to northeastern Illinois. Three years later, Joseph Timothy was born (August 1985). Joanna Lily (December &#8217;88), Bethany Ruth (August &#8217;90), Samuel Luke (March &#8217;92), and Jonathan Mark (November &#8217;93) came all in a rush. Our eighth baby, Joyful Victory, was miscarried in March of 1995. God gave us joy with the coming of Ezra John on February 14, 1996. In May of the following year, we moved to Sherman, Texas. January 2nd, 1998, was the day of Moses Stanley&#8217;s birth (his middle name is after my maternal grandpa). We relocated again in July, 1998, this time to Hartsville, a small town in the beautiful rolling hills of middle Tennessee. Daddy is working in the Customer Service department of the Rock-Tenn facility in Gallatin, Tennessee. This division of Rock-Tenn makes corrugated boxes and displays. Daddy has a good sense of humor, and can keep us all rolling. He is the best accent imitator in the world, our favorite is his combination of Southern and Chinese accents. Daddy has a servant spirit, and is always willing to do the undesirable thing. Mommy works full-time as a professional mother. Since we have never been in school away from home, she has been teaching for the pest fifteen years. On top of that she manages laundry, cleaning, and all the other things that keep a home running.</p>

<p>Mom has had rheumatoid arthritis for almost twenty years, so she is not able to minister to her family as much as she would like to be able to do. Although she grows discouraged at times, she has a strong confidence in God; she knows He will do what is best for her family. Mommy is careful to honor Daddy in all she says and does. Av (20) has been working for one of our church elders who has a land surveying business; his job occupies most of his time. Computers have been one of Av&#8217;s hobbies for a long time; he taught himself most of what he knows about them. He has also taught himself some mechanics. He does hands-on things, like putting a new cylinder head in his car. Just like Mommy&#8217;s father, be is not afraid to try doing things he has never done before. There is almost always something being turned over in Av&#8217;s mind, although we never know quite what it is. I am sometimes amazed at his analytical abilities. My brother is the best older brother. He likes me; I like him.</p>

<p>Joseph (13) has found several new interests since we moved to Tennessee. Our only neighbors, a family from our church, have goats, cows, and chickens. For some reason, Joseph and Mr. Gregory became fast friends. Joseph has learned a lot about animals and gardening. (One of the best gardeners in the area happens to be Mr. Gregory.) Usually Joseph&#8217;s work is done diligently. His free time is mostly spent playing sports, helping Mr. Gregory, or playing with his younger brothers.</p>

<p>Next in line is Joanna (10). Joanna is our musician. She is learning to read music now, but she has been playing the piano &#8220;by ear&#8221; for a long time. Many skills are being learned as she helps with laundry, cooking, baby care, and other household duties. Any available reading material is devoured by Joanna. Her somewhat amazing memory is put to work on many Scripture verses. She desires to become more like Christ.</p>

<p>Our &#8220;baby&#8221; girl, Bethany (8), is a bouncy one! She is usually cheerful as she works at her school and chores. Holding babies is one of Bethany&#8217;s favorite things to do. She has a soft spot in her heart for &#8220;Baby Mo,&#8221; and tries to stop his crying in every legitimate way. Like Joanna, she memorizes much Scripture, though she has to work harder at it. Whenever someone needs help, Bethany is there. Her example inspires me.</p>

<p>Samuel (7) is the first of four boys in a row. He enjoys playing with both his older and younger brothers. Drawing is Samuel&#8217;s specialty, along with Bethany. Pardon my bias&#8212;they are talented! Mom has been working with Samuel on reading for a while, and he is making good progress. Clearing the table after breakfast and putting laundry in the dryer are a couple of Samuel&#8217;s responsibilities. Jonathan likes it when he can help his brother with his chores. Samuel is also diligent in working on his memory verses.</p>

<p>Our seventh child is Jonathan (5). I asked Jonathan what he likes to do. His list included playing games, going outside when it is sunny, playing basketball, jumping on a trampoline, and playing with Lego blocks. He is good friends with Ezra; the two years between them are insignificant. Helping the big people with their work gives Jonathan pleasure; I think it helps him know he is a valuable part of the family.</p>

<p>After losing Joyful, we did not take Ezra&#8217;s life for granted; he is our precious treasure. The first &#8220;E&#8221; after me, I am glad that we share middle initials, too. Ezzie tries to act just like his brothers&#8212;a fact which we use to exhort them to proper behavior. Now that Ez is three, he is exhibiting some of those typical two-year-old traits. (He is one of the quieter type, and it took him a while to realize that he could resist authority.) We pray for God&#8217;s grace, that we might be able to teach him that submission is always best.</p>

<p>Moses is our youngest for now. He is the most intense baby I have ever known. One minute he will be screaming in joy,and the next, crying in anger. This presents a challenge in training him. We love our little treasure, though. Our prayer is that one day his passion will be used for God&#8217;s glory.</p>

<h2>Could you share with us a spiritual lesson God has or is teaching you?</h2>
<p>God is constantly working on me. Let me share one thing of importance. I am beginning to realize that if I fail to do my part in making my mom and dad successful each day, I have not been successful that day. Woman was created to be a helper to man. As daughters, we are to support our moms and dads. The wife is told to submit to her husband. The wife&#8217;s goals should be one with her husband&#8217;s. There are many things we want to do, but it is essential that we realize that crossing off every item on our to-do list is not the most important thing to accomplish. What Daddy wants done is what must be done. I try to ask Daddy every morning if there is something I can do for him. Often it is something small, like making sure a card gets in the mail. It can be more of a challenge to serve Mommy. When I finally finish my work, I want to be able to do the things I need to do, but do not have to do. However, if Mom has something she did not get done at that time, or if she needs me to do something before I get done with my work, it is more important to do her thing than my thing. I still struggle to find the proper balance between fulfilling my responsibilities and not being selfish with my time.</p>

<p>This whole outlook is a challenge to maintain. If I finish everything I wanted to do, I feel successful. By God&#8217;s grace, I will learn that true success is found in the success of those I am serving.</p>

<p>One of our elders, Pastor Carroll, has a land surveying business. The success of his business is not surprising when you watch his wife, Mrs. Linda. Setting aside personal ambitions, she works day in and day out for her husband. In my eyes, and I think in God&#8217;s, her life up till now is a success, because her husband has succeeded.</p>

<h2>Could you share with us a hard time which the Lord used to refine you?</h2>
<p>After seven normal pregnancies, Mom&#8217;s miscarriage in March of 1995 was a shock to all of us. God alone kept me through that time, because I felt like giving up on Him, but I never did. I kept believing Him when I felt no reason to do so. Looking back at this experience has given me assurance that my faith is not dependent on me; if it was, I would certainly be lost. The Lord Jesus is the Author and Finisher of my faith. I am kept by His power, not my effort.</p>

<p>The Lord used Joyful&#8217;s death as He often does in a family; we came to appreciate one another to a greater degree after experiencing death. We also gained the ability to enter into the sorrows of others. Death causes us to long for our eternal home.</p>

<h2>Would you mind sharing a favorite book, poem, or recipe?</h2>
<p>In the days following the miscarriage, the Lord comforted me with the words of Lina Sandell Berg (1832-1903), a young woman who knew the pain of losing her precious father in an unexpected accident.</p>

<h2><a href="../../../music/Day_by_Day/index.html" title="Day by Day">Day by Day</a></h2>
<p class="verse">Day by day, and with each passing moment,
<br />Strength I find, to meet my trials here;
<br />Trusting in my Father&#8217;s wise bestowment,
<br />I&#8217;ve no cause for worry or for fear.
<br />He Whose heart is kind beyond all measure
<br />Gives unto each day what He deems best—
<br />Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure,
<br />Mingling toil with peace and rest.</p>

<p class="verse">Every day, the Lord Himself is near me
<br />With a special mercy for each hour;
<br />All my cares He fain would bear, and cheer me,
<br />He Whose Name is Counselor and Power;
<br />The protection of His child and treasure
<br />Is a charge that on Himself He laid;
<br />&#8220;As thy days, thy strength shall be in measure,&#8221;
<br />This the pledge to me He made.</p>

<p class="verse">Help me then in every tribulation
<br />So to trust Thy promises, O Lord,
<br />That I lose not faith&#8217;s sweet consolation
<br />Offered me within Thy holy Word.
<br />Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,
<br />Ever to take, as from a father&#8217;s hand,
<br />One by one, the days, the moments fleeting,
<br />Till I reach the promised land.</p>

<h2>In conclusion, is there anything else you would like to add?</h2>
<p>Thank you, Skye and Abigail, for giving me the opportunity to write this. I pray that it, as well as every other aspect of my life, will encourage everyone that comes contact with it to <span class="scripture">&#8220;look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+4%3A18" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 4:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 4:18)</span></a></span></p>

<hr class="minor" />
<h1>On Godly Relationships</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Friends,</p>

<p>The inky blackness that spills so early over the countryside in winter had crept upon us before we reached our house, finding me in the back seat of the van, between a sleeping baby and a wakeful one. I held the soft hand of my little brother, stroking his fingers, listening to his sweet baby songs, and in the peaceful darkness marveling at it all.</p>

<p>Two babies keep a house lively. Very lively. Perhaps that&#8217;s why the quiet moments, when the chaos settles into babbling baby song or drowsy storytime or a soft hand to hold in the car, touch so deeply. Love for little ones is so pure&#8230;&#8203;so simple&#8230;&#8203;and rendered all the more beautiful in its innocence. For with any of us, but especially a baby, the future is vague and filled with uncertainties. Even as we love these dear little ones we can&#8217;t know what the outcome of that love will be&#8212;yet for today we can only love, committing tomorrow to the tender care of the Author of that love, trusting Him to draw them to Himself and make our loved ones ours forever.</p>

<p>Somehow, such love clarifies our vision. Complexities often cloud other relationships, but looking at my baby brother and sister, I see true brotherly love, and its clear desire: that its object have the best. That realization clears the clouds away. How can what shows so plainly with my brothers and sisters be so obscure with brothers and sisters in Christ? Relationships compose all that endures of this life&#8212;relationships with God and with others. Maybe that&#8217;s why so much of our thought, our conversation, and our learning is geared toward trying to understand and strengthen them. In the late-night discussions that leave us bleary-eyed in the morning, I&#8217;ve many times explored with a friend or sister the facets of relationships: why they work or don&#8217;t work, problems with them and how they could be improved. And more than once, spurred by our own wonderings and watching people around us, these conversations lead to a question about one particular facet: How would God have us as Christian young ladies relate to young men?</p>

<p>Much has been written about courtship and betrothal, and I trust you&#8217;re familiar with the principles behind them. That&#8217;s not what I mean to write about here, anyway. We range into territory less explored: What guidelines has God given us for the everyday associations, for the casual acquaintances? Even&#8212;or perhaps I should say especially&#8212;when we&#8217;ve determined to avoid dating and its problems, we have a lot to sort out about other guy/girl relationships.</p>

<p>We never have to discuss the matter for long before someone brings up the passage that exhorts us to treat <span class="scripture">&#8220;younger men as brothers&#8230;&#8203;and younger women as sisters, with absolute purity.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+5%3A1-2" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 5:1-2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 5:1-2)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New International Version">NIV</span></p>

<p>Just as quickly, someone always points out, &#8220;But a lot of things you can do with your brother that you can&#8217;t properly do with some other young man.&#8221; Admittedly. &#8220;There must be more to it than that.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is. And there isn&#8217;t. At least, in a concept God showed me in that passage recently.</p>

<p>I remember our love for our babies, my brother and sister. What does brotherly love inspire, but to desire the best for them? And what is best, but a close relationship with the Lord, seeking and doing His perfect will?</p>

<p>Then I realize that perhaps the real question we should each ask about interactions with brothers in Christ is, &#8220;Will my words, actions, dress, and attitude build them up in their relationship to Christ?&#8221; If what we do or say or think would in anyway sidetrack or stall them, it doesn&#8217;t show Christian love. Yet how easy it is to relate in a way that seeks to further human relationships more than the relationship of man to his Maker!</p>

<p>Granted, it&#8217;s a simple thought. Further study could no doubt yield a wealth of formulas, principles, and applications; probably someone somewhere has thought them up already. Still, at the moment this idea captures me perhaps even more in its freshness and simplicity.</p>

<p>The challenge will come in living it out, for I see at once that the new picture it paints leaves no room for some things.</p>

<p>Curiously, even as we&#8217;ve turned away from the usual teenage activities (which for girls seem often to involve young men in one sense or another, whether flirting with them, looking beautiful for them, talking about them, or spending time with them), even as we endeavor to learn skills and build character fitting for our future, we too often seem to stumble into a trap we never expected.</p>

<p>We distort an esteem of marriage and homemaking as an honorable, God-given pursuit into <i>seeking marriage rather than seeking God.</i></p>

<p>We forget that the path we esteem was meant as a way to honor and serve God, and begin to see it as an end unto itself.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t realize that we need to seek the Lord first and always, and that in Him and only in Him&#8212;not in any man, however godly and God-given&#8212;will we find <span class="scripture">&#8220;fulness of joy.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+16%3A11" title="Psalm 16:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 16:11)</span></a></span></p>

<p>So we panic. I know; I&#8217;ve seen it, heard it, even done it. (The soppy books about girls who have had ten proposals by the time they&#8217;re sixteen probably don&#8217;t help much, either!) And, in case God&#8217;s forgotten the impossibility of becoming a godly homemaker without a husband with whom to establish that home (not to mention our own frightening visions of becoming old maids, as if no fate could be worse), we wonder if maybe we should&#8212;er&#8212;no, we don&#8217;t want to think of it that way, but maybe, um, help God a little bit? We fear to leave the matter solely in His hands; moreover, we remain concerned about the matter, as if we cannot be entirely satisfied and fulfilled with only God.</p>

<p>No wonder wisdom exhorts us, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Above all else, guard your heart.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+4%3A23" title="Proverbs 4:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 4:23)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New International Version">NIV</span> What deception our hearts can unwittingly nurture!</p>

<p>Yet distracted though we may be at times by fears or doubts or confusions&#8212;consumed as we may be by our own lives and struggles&#8212;we are not freed from our responsibility to others. As brothers and sisters in Christ, we are supposed to esteem others as more than ourselves and look out for their interests before our own&#8230;. We not only need to guard our own hearts; we also need to watch for the condition of others. To the extent that <i>our</i> actions or attitudes can make a difference, we are responsible for our effect on others.</p>

<p>The thought sobers me. How then could I even in unguarded moments entertain a thought of attracting a young man&#8217;s attention? Do I really desire him to turn his eyes away from the Lord and toward me? Dare I make his Christian walk harder, and throw distractions in the way? In those terms, I couldn&#8217;t want that!</p>

<p>And why worry that I somehow need to help God to make His will plain? Yes, in the proper time a woman can be a good and God-given addition to a man&#8217;s life&#8212;but only when the match and timing align with the Lord&#8217;s will. Until then it can only be a distraction, diverting his gaze from that will. And when the right time comes, if he&#8217;s looking only for God&#8217;s guidance as He lays the path before him, will not that Guide be both a surer and purer one than the efforts of some female to attract the fellow&#8217;s attention?</p>

<p>It keeps our responsibility toward the young men we know in clear focus. We dare not let ourselves become diversions to them; in all our interactions we must have clearly in mind their relationship with Christ and how we can help and not hinder that. Our conduct based on that may vary from situation to situation&#8212;but we won&#8217;t wrong our brothers if we seek to further their relationship with Christ rather than with us. And if in God&#8217;s time and His plan He weaves together the details that bring each of us together with our lifetime companion, won&#8217;t it be far more beautiful than anything we could have authored?</p>

<p>The thought brings with it another sobering reminder: if we allow our thoughts and emotions to stray toward young men outside of the right time and the right one, we, too, glance away from God&#8217;s path.</p>

<p>This perspective on relationships will take much work to learn, but we have numerous opportunities to practice it. For although I saw this principle first in the picture I&#8217;ve shared of relating to young men, that&#8217;s only a small part of it. The concept goes much further, touching how we relate to everyone we know: family members, friends, strangers. Through its lens I see what trouble I could have avoided in some relationships, what benefit could have been gained by it in others. If only I had understood!</p>

<p>Dimly now I recognize that this idea of Christ-centered relationships is not a new one, but one often spoken of&#8212;indeed, I know people who relate in this way, and I admired them for it even while blind to the pattern they followed. Yet seeds that had lain in my mind as mere words and vague concepts before suddenly burst into bloom now.</p>

<p>All this is fresh to me yet. It&#8217;s easy to see in theory the importance of centering our relationships on Christ; it&#8217;s much more difficult to actually do it. I sense that progress will be slow&#8212;that it will require constant reminders, much prayer, more than a few fumbles. Problems plague real-life relationships, not the smallest of which is the little time we have to consider what we say and do beforehand. Still, I see what a difference this mindset could make in all my relationships&#8212;what blessed relief it spells from the smothering confines of self&#8212;and I want to strive for it. And working on perspective must come first; for although face-to-face encounters with others leave us little time to examine what we do, except in retrospect, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+3%3A11" title="James 3:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 3:11)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New International Version">NIV</span>&#8212;even a drop? Yet we cannot seem to help doing so, unless we be filled with His thoughts and His attitudes. Perhaps I should have waited to share these things with you until I have more experience applying them to lend credence to my words. Then again, perhaps I need the accountability. As I seek to make Christ the center of all my relationships, if you have done or are doing the same, would you share with me what you learn?</p>

<p>O Lord, give us purity and clarity of focus in our relationships, that our lives may honor You!</p>

<h1>From the Hearts of Our Readers</h1>

<hr class="minor" />
<p class="noindent">Dear Skye and Abigail,</p>

<p>Greetings to you both!</p>

<p>Thank you very much for sending me DP! I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t write sooner. I enjoyed reading it very much. I think it&#8217;s just wonderful that you are trusting God to support this ministry. I believe that if a magazine is truly a work of God, it will succeed (without subscription rates!). Amen?! [Yes!&#8212;Ed.]</p>

<p>My family has actually been home churching for about three years (I think I said two in my last letter). On Sundays just my family has church together&#8212;Daddy, Mama, me, Elisabeth, Tori, Joanna and Nathanael. We sing hymns, which we all enjoy very much, take communion, and listen to a tape by one of the &#8220;old time&#8221; preachers like T. Austin Sparks, A. W. Tozer, Leonard Ravenhill, and Paris Riedhead. We have really enjoyed having church at home. The Lord has also used this time of little fellowship to strengthen us and draw us close to Him. We all have learned many valuable and sometimes hard lessons. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A28" title="Romans 8:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 8:28)</span></a></span> Right now we do fellowship with one other family, not on Sundays. They are attending a church and are not looking to leave. We are like-minded in some areas. We are really enjoying the fellowship of this family.</p>

<p>I enjoyed both of your letters. Abigail, even though you&#8217;re a younger publisher than those of other magazines, I appreciated what you had to say&#8212;we need to give all glory and be fully surrendered to Him. The latter has really been on my heart lately. Skye, you&#8217;re definitely not the only one who struggles to get out of bed in the morning! I struggle with that, too. Although I&#8217;m usually able to get ready for the day quickly enough to have my quiet time, it&#8217;s the point. After a good night&#8217;s rest, getting up should be a piece of cake! But our flesh gets in the way. This is definitely an area we need to seek God about and just mortify our flesh! His grace is always there for us. And when we think of all that He has done for us, getting up to spend just a few minutes with Him is absolutely nothing! It should be an honor to spend time &#8220;repaying&#8221; Him the debt we owe. <span class="scripture">&#8220;O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+63%3A1" title="Psalm 63:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 63:1)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+8%3A17" title="Proverbs 8:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 8:17)</span></a></span> Do you set an alarm? Also, try getting ready first&#8212;dress, brush hair, etc. before praying. I&#8217;ve found this helps me wake up better so I can really focus on my prayer time.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always enjoyed the &#8220;Meet&#8230;&#8203;&#8221; sections. Amy&#8217;s comment, &#8220;when I completely &#8216;turnover&#8217; to God everything I have&#8230;&#8203;little things&#8230;&#8203;and big things&#8230;&#8203;what freedom, what joy comes!&#8221; was a blessing. It&#8217;s an encouragement to know others are dealing with many of the same issues.</p>

<p>I also enjoyed the letters. It seemed like everyone really enjoyed &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Pikas_Treasure/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Pika's Treasure">Pika&#8217;s Treasure&#8212;What About Mine?</a>&#8221; Could you please send me all of your back issues? I&#8217;m very anxious to read this article and also &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_6/Seek_Him_Early/index.html" title="Dear Princess 6/Seek Him Early">Seek Him Early</a>,&#8221; by E. M. Bounds.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to reading what subscribers have to say about &#8220;Dresses vs. Pants.&#8221; My mom, sister, and I wanted to send in something for it, but weren&#8217;t able to get anything together before the deadline. For about six years now, my family has been dressing modestly&#8230;. Before we started home churching, we attended a &#8220;sister&#8221; church of Charity Christian Fellowship in Pennsylvania. During the thee years we were there, we learned so many things that we didn&#8217;t even know were in the Bible. Things such as separation from the world (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+12%3A2">Romans 12:2</a>), holy living (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+12">Hebrews 12</a>), and dressing modestly (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A3">I&nbsp;Peter 3:3</a>), to name a few. We have enjoyed dressing modestly very much. There have been many occasions that people have approached us asking if we were Amish or Mennonite. We then are able to tell them that we aren&#8217;t Amish or Mennonite, but are just Christians trying to follow the Word of God. It&#8217;s been a blessing to be able to share our faith.</p>

<p>I have a question about Laura&#8217;s article. God knows everything about us. So how can He be our confidant? To me, a confidant is someone you tell your secrets to. We can&#8217;t have any secrets kept from God. He knows us better than we know ourselves. <span class="scripture">&#8220;O L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, thou hast searched me, and known me. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, thou knowest it altogether. Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it. Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?&#8230;&#8203;I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+139%3A1-7%2C14" title="Psalm 139:1-7,14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 139:1-7,14)</span></a></span></p>

<p>I appreciated the poem very much. These days, the phase, &#8220;What Would Jesus Do?&#8221; seems to be popular in the contemporary Christian world. This thought shouldn&#8217;t just be a trend, but a heart matter. If we&#8217;re truly serving and loving God, all that we do will be to His honor and glory. And we won&#8217;t be ashamed of our actions.</p>

<p>I also enjoyed reading &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_7/I_Will_Never_Leave_Thee_Nor_Forsake_Thee/index.html" title="Dear Princess 7/I Will Never Leave Thee Nor Forsake Thee">I Will Never Leave Thee Nor Forsake Thee</a>&#8221; by Heather Eley. This is a very touching story. It is wonderful to see how God taught this family to trust Him during this difficult time. May all of us always have this kind of faith and trust in Him, no matter what our circumstances may be. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Trust in the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+3%3A5-6" title="Proverbs 3:5-6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 3:5-6)</span></a></span>&nbsp;&#8221;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_7/A_Bible_Lesson/index.html" title="Dear Princess 7/A Bible Lesson">A Bible Lesson</a>,&#8221; by Jenny C. Rutty, on trusting God was also a blessing.</p>

<p>Jessica Dorfsmith&#8217;s drawings are beautiful! She has quite a talent!</p>

<p>Thank you again for sending me <i>DP</i>. It&#8217;s wonderful to see a magazine centered on the things of God&#8212;those that are eternal. I&#8217;ve come across many that are about things that are temporal. <span class="scripture">&#8220;While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+4%3A18" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 4:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 4:18)</span></a></span> Keep up the good work! God bless you as you endeavor to do His will!</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Stephanie,</p>

<p>In response to your question, &#8220;How God can be our Confidant when He already knows everything about us?&#8221; I would like to bring up the thought of our will and ability to choose. God gave us each a free will that we may seek Him or not. Many scriptures refer to this decision: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Who is on the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>&#8217;s side? let him come unto me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Exodus+32%3A26" title="Exodus 32:26"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Exodus 32:26)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+30%3A19" title="Deuteronomy 30:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Deuteronomy 30:19)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;Choose you this day whom ye will serve.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Joshua+24%3A15" title="Joshua 24:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Joshua 24:15)</span></a></span></p>

<p>God has a standard to be met before we can be accepted of Him, but since He desires only a voluntary love, He never forces us to meet that standard&#8212;only calls out in mercy that we might be saved. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Seek ye the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+55%3A6-7" title="Isaiah 55:6-7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 55:6-7)</span></a></span> Therefore, though He knows us altogether, we can&#8217;t know Him, His love, power, or friendship until we meet the requirements and forsake all sin. <span class="scripture">&#8220;The L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+34%3A18" title="Psalm 34:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 34:18)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;The L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+145%3A18" title="Psalm 145:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 145:18)</span></a></span></p>

<p>It is when we choose God&#8217;s way and are received of Him that we can reap the benefits He has for all His children. One of those benefits is having Him for our closest Confidant. It is our choice to receive the blessing of His closeness, the blessing which He has held out all along to those who will seek it. Enoch and Noah <span class="scripture">&#8220;walked with God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+5%3A24%3B++6%3A9" title="Genesis 5:24;  6:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 5:24;  6:9)</span></a></span> Abraham was called <span class="scripture">&#8220;the Friend of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+2%3A23" title="James 2:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 2:23)</span></a></span> David chose Him to be his Counselor, Guide, and Friend and reaped the benefits: <span class="scripture">&#8220;I have set the Lord always before me: because He is at my right hand, I shall never be moved.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+16%3A8" title="Psalm 16:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 16:8)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee&#8230;&#8203;To see thy power and thy glory&#8230;. Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee&#8230;. Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice. My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+63%3A1-3%2C7-8" title="Psalm 63:1-3,7-8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 63:1-3,7-8)</span></a></span></p>

<p>There is a good illustration in the story of Mary and Martha (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+10%3A38-42">Luke 10:38-42</a>). Jesus was near to both of them, desired to commune and teach them both, to be their cloest friend, but they each responded differently. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+10%3A42" title="Luke 10:42"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 10:42)</span></a></span> Jesus said when Martha came to Him in vexation. Mary had chosen to draw close to Jesus, to really know Him and find the peace His presence brought. Though Martha had the same opportunity, she focused instead on the cares of the home, in serving where she thought was necessary. Yes, Jesus knew all about her, but she wasn&#8217;t experiencing the blessing and peace of confiding and abiding in Him. She needed to lay all those cares and worries at His feet and learn of Him, discover His way of rest for her soul, and take Him as her closest Confidant.</p>

<p>Finally, to address the thought of the Lord being One to confide in. Yes, we won&#8217;t be confiding or telling anything He doesn&#8217;t already know (and most completely, too), but it brings Him pleasure for us to take the action of going to Him. If we think of it in terms of how we relate to our parents, this truth may become more apparent. Oftentimes they notice many things about us and our day, but it is when we take the time to confide these things to them ourselves that a close relationship can be built.</p>

<p>I hope these thoughts are helpful to you. If they do not answer your question satisfactorily, please let me know. May the Lord&#8217;s way be exalted and His name be glorified.</p>

<p>Dear Miss Abigail:</p>

<p>I am a busy mother of four young, home-educated children. Recently I have experienced great anguish and torment due to a trial of my heart, which included other people. I did not feel free to discuss this situation with anyone due to the integrity of my heart. I sought comfort in God and my understanding husband. Still I longed for comfort in a friend.</p>

<p>While busy with my day today I received the mail and with it came the new edition of <i>Dear Princess</i>. I felt a stirring in my heart to take time to read it&#8230;&#8203;and soon. God provided the moment not long afterward, and as I read your editorial my heart and my eyes began to weep with comfort. I find it moving when Solomon said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;There is nothing new under the sun,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ecclesiastes+1%3A9" title="Ecclesiastes 1:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ecclesiastes 1:9)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New International Version">NIV</span> he was speaking true wisdom. Whether you are young or old, the enemy of a peaceful heart is still the wily temptation Satan brings to be offended and to defend ourselves. I found it comforting all the more to know that others struggle, too, and there is virtue at the end. It isn&#8217;t as if I haven&#8217;t had a trial of the heart before. Each time it is a greater opportunity to respond quickly with love and an open heart, while my flesh wants to hide away and live in the shame of the accusation. I am thankful that the word of God is true and though many say and do evil, God Himself will never leave us or forsake us, and we are to take comfort in that. The fear of man brings a snare but the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Oh, how we need that wisdom! I don&#8217;t mean to ramble. I just wanted to share this with you while it was fresh in my heart; God used your story and your magazine for His glory today, and He was the lifter of my head through your open and transparent heart.</p>

<p>Thank you and God bless you.</p>

<p class="signature">With affection,<br />A sister in Christ</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Author/Publishers of Dear Princess Magazine,</p>

<p>A few days ago I received my first issue of <i>Kindred Spirits</i> (which happens to be the last issue). I read Skye Erickson&#8217;s article and was blessed. (Though I couldn&#8217;t figure out which one she was in the photo!)</p>

<p>When looking through the magazine recommendations, I realized that <i>Dear Princess</i> might be the &#8220;small magazine&#8221; Miss Erickson co-edits, so, with my mother&#8217;s permission, I am writing to ask for you to put me on the mailing list.</p>

<p>Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Sarah Knecht; I am 16 years old and the oldest of 7 (soon to be 8). The name of your magazine caught my eye because my name means &#8220;princess.&#8221; My last name means &#8220;servant&#8221; in German, and the combined meanings are such a source of inspiration to me!</p>

<p>The dear Lord knew me as I was being <span class="scripture">&#8220;curiously wrought&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+139%3A15" title="Psalm 139:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 139:15)</span></a></span> and picked me, or should I say, bestowed on me a name of His own choosing, for which I am grateful. I can completely trust that &#8220;Jesus doeth all things well&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/All_the_Way_My_Savior_Leads_Me/index.html" title="All the Way My Savior Leads Me">*</a> as the hymn says.</p>

<p>I live here in Tampa, Florida as I have lived for the past 6 years. We moved here in 1992 to be near a military hospital because my Dad (who was in the military) was injured in an Army training mission. His brain injury resulted in the paralyzation of his left arm and leg. Though his eye (left one) is blind and he walks with a limp, God spared him to us with the full use of his brain and speech.</p>

<p>God has led our family through so much, it would take a book to tell it all though I can say this: He is always faithful. We thank God for Dad&#8217;s injury because now he can stay home and train us up in the way we should go. Dad works hard to instill in us the importance of character in our lives and I believe his faithfulness to his family and responsibility has paid off as lam learning to love the Lord God with all my heart, soul, mind and strength.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time and effort.</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Skye and Abigail,</p>

<p>Hello! Praise our blessed Lord! I just finished reading my first issue of the <i>DP</i>, which was the <a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_7/index.html" title="Dear Princess 7">Fall 1998</a> issue, and I also just received my <a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_8/index.html" title="Dear Princess 8">Winter issue</a> in the mail. Before this I had never even heard of <i>DP</i>, and what a great magazine I&#8217;ve been missing out on! I thank God that my friend, Julie Brill, told me about it! I really enjoyed the fall issue and look forward to reading this new one! My heart-felt sympathy goes out to Heather Eley; may the Lord comfort her heart with all His name comforts, and her family also.</p>

<p>Your story, Skye, about the printer and how you hadn&#8217;t prayed and asked God first, was a blessing to my family, as we were reading something in Joshua very similar to your story. Things didn&#8217;t go well for Joshua because he hadn&#8217;t prayed. I know God was trying to impress upon us the importance of asking <i>every</i> time before we do <i>anything</i>. Joshua had to pay the consequence; praise the Lord for His mercy in your case. He knows we make mistakes, and is ever merciful to us! I enjoyed Amy Zander&#8217;s interview also!</p>

<p>God bless you and thank you for your magazine!</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Skye, Abigail, and all you other dear princesses,</p>

<p>Hello! My name is Andrea Pratt and I&#8217;m a new subscriber to <i>Dear Princess</i>. I received my winter issue of <i>DP</i> and finished it within two days; I liked it so much. It is such a blessing to me. Though it is similar to <i>HopeChest</i>, it is also different and unique and wonderful in its own special way. I can&#8217;t wait till get the next issue.</p>

<p>Abigail, I especially liked your editorial about not explaining ourselves over every little thing. That is not one of my strong points I&#8217;m afraid and so often I wish to clear the air, let everyone know I&#8217;m not the one who did it, or that&#8217;s not what I mean when I said that, etc. Like you said, if one tries to correct the talebearer of what really happened or was said, they don&#8217;t believe you and &#8220;strife ensues.&#8221; A lot of the little arguments that happen daily probably could be avoided if more people let go of their rights to having their name cleared and just keep quiet.</p>

<p>Only today I was reading in <i>The Genesis Record</i> by Henry M. Morris about Joseph and Potiphar&#8217;s wife. I quote, &#8220;There is no indication that they were utterly untrue, and he was being punished unjustly, he still kept quiet&#8230;. Joseph opened not his mouth, thus demonstrating one of the most difficult, most Christlike-traits of character for a Christian to develop.&#8221;</p>

<p>In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+53%3A7">Isaiah 53:7</a> it says: <span class="scripture">&#8220;He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.&#8221;</span> And <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+2%3A19-23">I&nbsp;Peter 2:19-23</a> says: <span class="scripture">&#8220;For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully. For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Like Jesus&#8212;our prime example&#8212;we should not worry about our rights, but rather concern ourselves with helping towards establishing a peaceful home. Let us remember to commit ourselves to Him that judgeth righteously.</p>

<p>I enjoyed all of this winter&#8217;s issue of <i>Dear Princess</i>. It was a blessing to me. Amy Molinero, I enjoyed your <a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_8/From_the_Hearts_of_Our_Readers/index.html" title="Dear Princess 8/From the Hearts of Our Readers">letter</a>. It appears as though you and I are quite the same. What I mean by that is that I have been trying to rise earlier, walk daily, have a better prayer time each and every day and throughout each and everyday, and to just be myself; myself is all I can truly be.</p>

<p>The rest of the magazine was very interesting. I especially liked &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_8/Fruit_of_Her_Hands/index.html" title="Dear Princess 8/Fruit of Her Hands">Fruit of Her Hands</a>.&#8221; We don&#8217;t yet have all the ingredients for the bread recipe, but I hope to get it soon. We have been largely brought up on store-bought bread and have only recently found a recipe that all like and that is good for everything from French toast to peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. If Buttermilk-Oat Bread is another to my family&#8217;s liking, we shall have two and then we won&#8217;t get sick of the same thing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d better sign off now. God bless you all in Christ.</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Skye,</p>

<p>Hi! My name is Anna Ragan and I&#8217;m a subscriber to <i>Dear Princess</i>. I just wanted to thank you for the wonderful work that you and Abigail are doing! I have been touched by the wonderful stories and testimonies in the magazine!</p>

<p>I just received my second issue of <i>Dear Princess</i> and loved it! I especially enjoyed the poem, &#8220;Thank You for the Valley.&#8221; I had come across that poem a few months ago, but couldn&#8217;t find it anywhere. Imagine how surprised I was to find it in the magazine!</p>

<p>I also enjoyed your article, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_8/Count_it_All_Joy/index.html" title="Dear Princess 8/Count it All Joy">Count it All Joy</a>.&#8221; I have really been struggling with expressing joy to others in my life. One of my favorite verses is <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+5%3A16">I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:16</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Be joyful always.&#8221;</span><span class="script_ver" title="New International Version">NIV</span> But lately, I have been having a hard time being joyful. But I tried your suggestion of singing a song, and it really cheered me up!</p>

<p>Keep up the good work and may God bless you as you continue to bless others!</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Abigail and Skye,</p>

<p>Thank you so much for allowing God to use you in this wonderful way. Abigail, your testimony was inspiring and beautiful. Skye, I read in <i>HopeChest</i>, about your desire to be emotionally and spiritually &#8220;married&#8221; to the Lord. That is wonderful. An older sister in the Lord shared with me that same thing a while ago. I want that, too. It is so important to keep our eyes on Jesus during these waiting years, and focus first on being <i>His</i> bride.</p>

<p>In the last issue, Holly Hageman submitted the poem, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_8/Wait/index.html" title="Dear Princess 8/Wait">Wait</a>.&#8221; That poem has been used by the Lord in an incredible way. I would like to share with you and all the <i>DP</i> readers an amazing story, to the glory of God.</p>

<p>My mom has a friend whose nephew has leukemia. He was rushed to the hospital unconscious and suffered two strokes and his organs were starting to shut down. This precious boy is only three years old. His family are Christians; by faith they were standing on God&#8217;s promises in His written word and His word revealed to their hearts. They knew their little boy would be healed. Many from the church were gathered around his hospital bed praying when he sat up and said he was hungry and would like pancakes. Praise be to the Lord! The doctors said he would die; it was only a matter of time. But Praise Him, our God is bigger than all that, isn&#8217;t He?! A prayer warrior was given April 18, a significant date for their family, as the day of his complete healing. Please pray!</p>

<p>This is where I get to the poem. My mother and sister and I really liked it and my mom gave a copy of it to her friend (whose nephew is in the hospital). She gave it to her brother and sister-in-law and it so encouraged them that they hung it on the wall of their son&#8217;s hospital room! (In St. Louis, Missouri.)</p>

<p>Many from the church who came to pray have seen the poem and asked for a copy. They made a whole stack of copies and are handing them out to whoever wants one! We are continuing to share it with others. Thank you so much, Holly, for submitting that! Isn&#8217;t it incredible what God can do when we are obedient to Him?</p>

<p>The story, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_8/Tell_What_the_Lord_Has_Done_for_You/index.html" title="Dear Princess 8/Tell What the Lord Has Done for You">Marvelously Healed</a>&#8221; was an awesome testimony. Thank you! We are sharing that with others. Thanks again and God bless you!</p>

<p class="noindent">Dearest Skye,</p>

<p>Yesterday I received the unexpectedly early (as I thought) issue of Dear Princess! I was so happy to receive it, and tried to fold laundry and read it at the same time (not a progressive endeavor). I was so glad to see that it seemed the theme of this issue was going through trials and sufferings victoriously (did you and Abigail do this intentionally&#8212;or did the Lord speak to all the writers about the same thing at the same time?); because I had requested <i>DP</i> not too long ago for a friend who is going through a great trial. Isn&#8217;t it amazing how the Lord works out things? [No, it was not intentional, Sarah. The Lord just brought together articles on that theme which was also encouraging to us. &#8212;Ed.]</p>

<p>Well, I have some wonderful news! The Lord has been enabling me to <b>run to Him immediately</b> when the devil showers me with temptations to think wrongly. Through these many opportunities to stretch forth my hands unto Him for strength to overcome the world, the flesh, and the devil, I have literally sensed Him planting my feet much more firmly on the Rock of Ages. I&#8217;ve also noticed that since I&#8217;ve been enabled to read my Bible in the morning nearly every day for the last few weeks, I&#8217;ve sensed the Lord&#8217;s presence so much more and have been able, through His grace, to leave Satan for <i>Him</i> to fight and turn my mind immediately on Him or a <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+4%3A8">Philippians 4:8</a> thought. I was really helped by my Mom&#8217;s illustration, so I&#8217;d like to share it with you. She said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Sarah, <i>all</i> the devil wants to do to you is to get you off the Lord&#8217;s path. He doesn&#8217;t care how he does it&#8212;all he cares about is if he&#8217;s successful. Now picture yourself walking on the Lord&#8217;s path joyfully. All of a sudden, Satan throws a dead rat at you (a sinful thought), and instead of turning your eyes at once to the Goal, and continue steadily walking toward it, without paying any attention to the dead rat, you start in on introspection. &#8220;How could this thought have entered my mind. Where did it come from?&#8221; Then you step off the path to investigate it, and Satan is delighted. He starts playing with your mind like a cat would toss and torture a mouse by asking you these introspective questions, and you get so horrified, looking at your weaknesses&#8230;&#8203;instead of on <i>Christ</i> who is <span class="scripture">&#8220;able even to subdue all things unto himself,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+3%3A21" title="Philippians 3:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 3:21)</span></a></span> that you sink into despair, worry, and you &#8220;chase your tail&#8221; beside the path until your hair falls out because of stress. Another way the devil gets you off the path is by placing a candy-coated dead rat under your nose. Your flesh loves the aroma and instead of looking to <i>Christ</i> to overcome your flesh and looking to <i>Him</i>, you trust in your own strength, and your flesh drags you off the path to indulge in sinful pleasure. Suddenly, you see where you&#8217;ve fallen and the devil pours despair over you, and instead of immediately looking to Christ, praying&#8230;&#8203;pleading His forgiveness and getting back on the path (and staying there!), you let the devil &#8220;throw&#8221; all your sins that he dragged up from the sea into your face, and allow Him to rob you of the view of Calvary, a blood-drenched cross, and a smitten Savior, and all the joy Christ has for you if you accept <span class="scripture">&#8220;his unspeakable gift.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+9%3A15" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 9:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 9:15)</span></a></span></p>

</blockquote>


<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever.

<p class="noindent">Dear Abigail and Skye,</p>

<p>I just wanted to thank you for all a the effort put into the <i>Dear Princess</i> magazine. The articles are so applicable to everyday life, with their emphasis on character and devotion to the Lord.</p>

<p>I was introduced to <i>Dear Princess</i> by little girl that I nanny. Her mother mentored me in the ways of the Lord, and taught me homemaking skills.</p>

<p>I currently live in Charlotte, NC, where I attend Bible and nursing school. I hope to use my nursing skills overseas as a missionary.</p>

<p>The teachings in <i>Dear Princess</i> have the same principles as what was taught me by my dear friend and mentor. I am so encouraged by the articles, as they reaffirm many Godly truths by which I am trying to model my life. Blessings to you and your families!</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;I was a stricken deer that left the herd
<br />Long since: with many an arrow deeply infixed
<br />My panting side was charged, when I withdrew
<br />To seek a tranquil death in distant shades.
<br />There was I found by One who had Himself
<br />Been hurt by the archers. In His side He bore
<br />And in His hands and feet the cruel scars.
<br />With gentle force, soliciting the darts,
<br />He drew them forth, and healed, and bade me live.&#8221;</p>

<p>This poem, written by the dear friend of Fanny Crosby, William Cowper, in his book, <i>The Task: Book III</i>, has captivated my thoughts since I read it this afternoon in the book, <i>In His Image</i>. It took on a special meaning to me as for my 15th birthday in January, I received a hawthorn character bow with two arrows. Slowly I am learning to use it. I know just how powerful the bow can be, and how deep the arrows do penetrate! Praise Him, we never have to endure more than He did!</p>

<p>In your editorial, Abigail, you quoted, <span class="scripture">&#8220;[Charity] seeketh not her own.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthias+13%3A5" title="I&nbsp;Corinthias 13:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthias 13:5)</span></a></span> The Lord taught me the meaning of this verse about a year ago, and if ever I slip back into the old thought pattern, the Holy Spirit says, &#8220;Ahem&#8230;&#8203;Sylvia? Remember, &#8216;Charity seeketh not&#8230;.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221; I am sure you all understand when I make the assumption that most of you who are reading this homeschool, have certain standards, truly make the Lord your whole focus, dress modestly, etc. So it is for me, but I was pretty legalistic about it, and had a real holier-than-thou attitude. It was at my church, my best and closest friends, and even in my homeschool group. It got to the point where anyone who did not homeschool with ATI, dress modestly, believe in courtship, go to the &#8220;proper&#8221; church&#8212;I really condemned them! Now this may come as a bit of a shock to you, but I was even developing a critical spirit to some of you who get <i>DP</i> and other magazines, all because you weren&#8217;t like me!</p>

<p>When I had to memorize 1 Corinthians 13 for Sunday School, the Lord really spoke to me. He said, &#8220;My daughter, you have not been glorifying My name through your spirit. I love you, not because of who you are, or because you are good, but because who <i>I am</i>. You have been shunning those who are My children, and this is wrong. Even those who are not Mine, you should be seeking to help them and show them Myself!&#8221;</p>

<p>Talk about a slap in the face! It was hard, but my Heavenly Father has told me that I shouldn&#8217;t restrict my &#8220;association&#8221; to those exactly of like mind. &#8220;Don&#8217;t seek <i>your</i> own. Seek those who are My own. And those who are not Mine, you have to help them.&#8221; Even now I still tend to be very critical, but I am trying to conquer these faults. Praise God from whom all blessings flow, who gives us life and strength!</p>

<p class="noindent">Dearest Sisters in the Lord,</p>

<p>Blessed, oh, we are blessed by our Faithful Father! My first issue of <i>Dear Princess</i> arrived this morning, a ray of sunshine in the dreary, rainy day. At first, I had not the time to read each article in depth, but merely glanced over it to become acquainted with you all. Later this evening, after a day of sewing, I perched, tailor-fashion atop my bed and read testimony after testimony of the workings of God in your lives. I feel such a kinship with you, for I see how similar our trials and victories are! I, too, am beginning to realize what peace comes in yielding to His will; being totally, completely submitted. The awesome thing is that <b>He knows best</b>! Though I try to be submitted to His will, I become tempted to think God is there to fulfill all my wishes, give me the desires of my heart. Something quoted by Israel Wayne in <i>Kindred Spirits</i> magazine helped me to realize what, in fact, was occurring in me, again and again. He said, &#8220;I was reading a book and came across a quote by the missionary, E. Stanley Jones: &#8216;If I throw out a boat hook from the boat and catch hold of the shore and pull, do I pull the shore to me, or do I pull myself to the shore? <i>Prayer is not pulling God to my will, but the aligning of my will to the will of God.</i>&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221; (Emphasis added.) I became aware that I was trusting, not in God&#8217;s sovereign will, but rather in my own ideas of what His will was. I had come to a standstill in my relationship with God because of my mistrust. Conviction weighed upon my heart, because deep in my soul, I knew He knew best, but my heart found it difficult, if not impossible to trust Him. Many times, over the next week, I turned to Him in prayer, I imploring Him to help me be obedient to His will, even though I felt it would be contrary to my own way of thinking. He has, He has! Monday, the answer came, and it was indeed a &#8216;No.&#8217; After four years of not knowing His will in the matter, to knowing without a doubt, is such a relief. Though I have surrendered my own will, I feel so free, so much peace in His; I feel prepared to walk ahead with Him, unafraid of the battles I may face, confident that He will make His will perfected in me.</p>

<p>Thank you so very, very, very much for sending me your magazine, <i>Dear Princess</i>. Mommy and I enjoyed it very much! I enjoy reading magazines that are based on Biblical principles.</p>

<p>I will tell you some about our family. The members of my family are: David (Daddy), Dianne (Mommy), Matthew (11), and Luke (5). My name is Ruth Anna Scott and I am 13 years old, my birth date is January 15, 1986. My family and I lived in Colorado until October 7, 1994, when we came here to Indianapolis&#8230;. We own an acre of land in Cedaredge, Colorado, about an hour away from Grand Junction, and we are building a house there. During the summer we go back to Colorado and work on our house.</p>

<p>While I was writing you a letter, a girl called about a violin. Our family has been looking for a violin for me for about a month or two. Every violin we have seen was not good enough to buy, when we went to buy, and the one we saw that was good enough to buy, couldn&#8217;t be found when we went to go see it. I was getting very frustrated and finally gave up my right to have a violin. It was a struggle at first to yield my rights to Him, but by His grace I did! I decided that the Lord did not want me to have a violin, at least for right now.</p>

<p>Our family (Daddy) called an answering machine, and no one ever called back from there about a violin. While I was writing this letter to you, we got a phone call. It was from a girl, the one who we had called on the answering machine. She said she was willing to sell it for $300. Our family went down to her house, about an hour away, and Mrs. Yeadon (a violin teacher) went with us to look at it. The violin was full sized, and German made, exactly what we had been looking for. We had been asking the Lord that if it was His will, He would give us a full-size violin, German-made, in His time. Mrs. Yeadon looked at it, and told us it was a very good violin. Daddy bought it, with some money from some chairs I had helped him upholster. Praise the Lord! I waited patiently on Him, trusted in Him, and He provided in His time a very good violin, which also came with a bow, music stand, and nice violin case&#8212;for a good price! What a wonderful God we serve!</p>

<p>I will be praying for you. I thank God for allowing me to find out about your magazine, <i>Dear Princess</i>. The Lord bless you, as you serve Him faithfully and wholeheartedly.</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Skye and Abigail,</p>

<p>I so very much enjoyed my issue of <i>Dear Princess</i>&#8230;. Everything I read was so very encouraging and glorifying to the Lord&#8230;&#8203;the articles on modesty helped to confirm my own reasons for dressing as I do, in modest skirts and dresses, and it helped to know that I wasn&#8217;t the only one to face pride. However, rather than give up my own standards on clothing, I sought the Lord to humble me in His sight. (Some people will turn from the Narrow Path because of pride, rather than turn from pride itself.) I thank Him that He continues to diligently keep me humble.</p>

<p>May God richly bless you!</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_10/readers_swimwear.jpg" alt="" width="99" height="150" /></div>
<p>Greetings of love in Jesus&#8217; name! I enjoyed <i>Dear Princess</i> very much! I was encouraged to find so many like-minded young ladies in the modesty discussion. Perhaps I am a little late, but I personally agree that dresses or jumpers are the right thing to wear. In Florida, we don&#8217;t have a need for warm things under our dresses. I&#8217;m sharing with you a picture of our swimwear. The shirt is a bit below the knees. The baggy pant legs go down to our ankles. We also have a vest. Dorcas Ebersole sews most of our clothes, as we do not have a knack for sewing, and are quite busy.</p>

<p>Overall, thank you so much for sending me <i>Dear Princess</i>. I enjoyed it so much!</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>Thank you for all your encouragement. Your letters and notes are a ray of sunshine to us.</p>

<p>We wanted to share with you a prayer request. Recently, we received a phone call from a subscriber asking us to pray for the Lester family of Montezuma, Georgia. The day before the call, the oldest son had fallen from off the top of the log cabin he was helping build. He was taken immediately to the hospital, unconscious, and put on life support. The following day, they discovered he had passed away. The Lester family was very thankful to know that their son and brother was saved and is now in Heaven. Please pray for them as they go through this hard time. I know they would appreciate a note, letting them know you are praying for them. If you&#8217;d like to write, their address is: The Lester Family Rt. 1, Box 206 Montezuma, GA 31063</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<h1>Fruit of Her Hands</h1>

<h2 class="subtitle">Summer Preserving</h2>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first"><span class="scripture">&#8220;O love the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, all ye his saints: for the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+31%3A23" title="Psalm 31:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 31:23)</span></a></span></p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Dear Girls,</p>

<p>I am sure those of you who planted a garden are enjoying harvesting and serving all those fresh vegetables. (Who doesn&#8217;t enjoy eating those sweet English peas straight from the garden or popping a cherry tomato in your mouth?) But what about all the fruit you can&#8217;t hold at the moment? Do you let it lie in waste in the garden or&#8230;&#8203;?</p>

<p>Remember how Jesus had the disciples gather up the unused food? So let&#8217;s gather up the extra and preserve it. This is one way we can serve our families and save money.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start out by making some beet pickles. I have always enjoyed making them. My favorite part is after the beets have been cooked, and the peeling comes off so easily, leaving that beautiful glossy beet.</p>

<p>Come with me now to the garden. Please bring a paring knife and large bucket. As you pull up the beets, cut off the tops leaving a 2&#8221; stem. (The leafy tops can be cooked as greens also, if you like.) If you cut off too much of the stem or cut the root, much of the red juices will bleed out of the vegetable, leaving it pale. I like to keep the dirt out of the kitchen so let&#8217;s scrub the beets outside.</p>

<p>Following is my husband&#8217;s grandmother&#8217;s special pickle beet recipe, along with a favorite raspberry sauce recipe.</p>

<p>Enjoy the summer and happy canning!</p>

<h2>Beet Pickles</h2>
<p>Fill water bath cooker or stock pot 3/4 full with clean beets. Fill with hot water, covering beets. Cover with lid and bring to a boil. Cook for 20-25 minutes or until peeling comes off when scraped with a knife.</p>

<p>While beets are cooking, wash 11 pint jars or 7 quarts. Place lids in pan of water to heat.</p>

<p>After beets are cooked, reserve:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>6 c. beet water</li>

</ul>
<p>Add to it:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>3 c. vinegar</li>

<li>2 c. sugar</li>

</ul>
<p>Heat to boiling.</p>

<p>Discard the remainder of water off the beets. Fill sink with cold water and place hot beets in to cool. Break off roots and stems and rub off peeling. Leave small beets whole, cut larger ones in chunks and place in hot jars. Cover with hot vinegar-sugar solution to 1/2&#8221; of jar top. To each jar add:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>bits of cinnamon stick</li>

<li>2 whole cloves</li>

</ul>
<p>Seal with hot lids and metal rings. Process in hot-water bath (190 &deg;) for 15 minutes. Season for two weeks before eating. Delicious served with roast, mashed potatoes, gravy, and English peas.</p>

<h2>Raspberry Sauce</h2>
<p>In very large bowl set aside:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>16 c. fruit</li>

</ul>
<p>Cook:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>6 c. additional fruit (mash to release color)</li>

<li>6 c. water</li>

</ul>
<p>Mix together:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>4 1/2 c. sugar</li>

<li>1 c. Clear Jel A</li>

</ul>
<p>Dissolve in:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>3 c. cold water</li>

</ul>
<p>Pour into fruit-water mixture. Bring to a boil.</p>

<p>Add:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>6 T. lemon juice</li>

</ul>
<p>Boil 1 minute. Fold sauce into large bowl of berries. Fill jars to 1/2&#8221; of top. Place hot lid on and screw on metal ring. Place on rack in water bath kettle, half full of hot water. Add more hot water to cover jars at least 1/2&#8221; above top surface. Cover canner and heat on high until it reaches 180-190 degrees. Set timer for 15 minutes. Remove with a jar lifter and place on dry towel. Cool, label and store.</p>

<p><b>Variations:</b> For marionberry, blackberry or boysenberries, crush all berries and and add:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>1 more c. sugar</li>

<li>1 c. honey</li>

</ul>
<p>Also heap up that cup of Clear Jel A. Process in hot-water bath 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Very delicious on waffles and pancakes or over cake.</p>

<h2>Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li>Place big beets in bottom, small ones on top for more even cooking.</li>

<li>After filling jars, wipe rim with a clean cloth. No particle must be there or it won&#8217;t seal.</li>

<li>Run finger along rim of each jar to check for nicks&#8212;discard those or magic mark with X on the bottom to save for storing dried foods.</li>

<li>Set jars an inch apart for cooling on dry, thick bath towels. A wet surface may cause jars to break.</li>

<li>Freeze water in 1- or 2-cup containers to have on hand for cooling vegetables.</li>

<li>Clear Jel A may be purchased from Nichols Nursery, Albany, OR. Phone: 1-541-928-9280 or e-mail: (nichols@gardennursery.com). Several ladies can order 25 pounds together and share! As a side note: we didn&#8217;t care for Instant Clear Jel&#8212;it was more cloudy-looking, not clear like Clear Jel A.</li>

<li>Use the basket of a large lettuce spinner for easy washing and draining of most berries. Do not, however use for raspberries. They are so fragile it is better to carefully wash and look through.</li>

<li>Magnetic wand&#8212;to pull lids out of hot water. Should be available at most special kitchen supply stores.</li>

</ul>

<h1>Dying to the Vision of Marriage</h1>

<p class="author">Brook (Tingom) Wayne</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Kindred Spirits,</p>

<p>Weddings. They are so beautiful&#8212;a ceremony that unites two hearts together. How much more beautiful even is the union of a Christ-centered marriage. How lovely it is to see two lives come together to further glorify God&#8217;s name! I was privileged to be a bridesmaid to such a marriage this September, in a wedding of my dear friend Jessica.</p>

<p>It was a bit sad, though, to watch Jessica marry&#8212;no more summer visits or ice cream sundaes in the middle of the night, or long afternoons antique shopping. Who did this young man think he was to steal away my friend!? Ah, well, such is the way God has established.</p>

<p>How lovely Jessica was, bedecked in bridal white! Her mother had sewn her wedding gown&#8212;a most elegant dress that perfectly suited Jessica. I was a little on the nervous side when, just two hours before the ceremony, the dress was finally finished, but even more amazed that Mrs. Hillmann appeared so very calm! It was good to see a young lady who had never dated, never had a boyfriend, but who had committed herself to saving her heart for her future husband. She didn&#8217;t spend her youth searching for her husband, but waited until God brought her husband into her life. At her wedding, she was ready to step out from under her father&#8217;s household and care, to be joined to her husband.</p>

<p>It was indeed a beautiful wedding!</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord: But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife. There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband. And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+7%3A32-35" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 7:32-35"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 7:32-35)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Here Paul draws a clear distinction between married women, and unmarried women. Unmarried women have their hearts full of God&#8217;s work. Married women necessarily have their hearts full of the family and home. We have discussed much the importance of the married woman&#8217;s role in her family and home, and the glory which she is able to give God through fulfilling the duties and responsibilities set before her. But let us now turn our attention to the unmarried woman&#8212;the position we young women are in at present.</p>

<p>Paul writes that unmarried women care for the things of the Lord, he doesn&#8217;t mean that married women do not care for the things of God, but they are merely caring for God&#8217;s things by caring for their families. The unmarried woman, however, does not have the needs of the family to attend to, and is therefore able to look after the things of the Lord free of the many duties of tending to a family. She can devote most, or even all of her time to the Lord&#8217;s service. I think there is also a bit of admonition in this verse, which Paul seems to assume, and it is this: young women, unmarried women, ought to care for the things of God. We girls should be attending to the work of God, we should be taking to heart His ways, we should be caring for the things of God. As young, unmarried women, our lives need to be focused on God, and that focus should be manifested by all that we do, and speak. Basically, since young unmarried women do not need to spend their time considering how they might please their husbands, their attention should be on the things of the Lord.</p>

<p>So, how might a young woman &#8220;care for the things of the Lord&#8221;? That is simple&#8212;for it is doing whatever God directs you to do. Has God called you to minister to little children? Or help in your family&#8217;s ministry? Then do it whole-heartedly, caring for His things. Has God given you many tasks at home, caring for younger siblings? Or caring for the sick? Then go about your work cheerfully, as unto the Lord. Roll up sleeves and set about to care for the things of the Lord by picking up the scattered toys and helping turn your family&#8217;s thoughts to God. In all things, serve the Lord. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+3%3A17" title="Colossians 3:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 3:17)</span></a></span></p>

<p>We see, in going about caring for the things of the Lord, we are to do that which He sets in front of us to do. He has, in each of our paths, just the right place for, us to serve Him. Don&#8217;t shrink from committing to caring for His things! There is no task too small though which we cannot glorify Him, nor any job too great, that He cannot teach and guide us in.</p>

<h2>Waiting on the Lord</h2>
<p>This summer my family and I were visiting some friends of my father&#8217;s. As many people do, the wife asked if I was dating. I replied &#8220;no,&#8221; and my mother and I began to explain the courtship plan to her, and about the need to save one&#8217;s heart for marriage. Next she asked if there were any young men of our acquaintance that I was interested in.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s just the point. I have purposed to save my heart for my future husband; I do not look about me to see whom it is I might marry. I&#8217;m not depending on my own judgment in selecting a husband, or attempting to find that person. God is so much more capable of that! If He has created the entire earth and taken such special care of me throughout all my days, if He has guided me in His ways and not the paths of evil, if He has placed lessons in even the smallest of matters for my growth, shouldn&#8217;t I trust God to choose my husband? I needn&#8217;t go &#8220;looking about,&#8221; for I am then taking into my own hands something I cannot control, but have only the potential to ruin, and am taking from God a responsibility I am not meant to have. Rather, I need to let God handle the matter completely, allowing Him to work out am the details in my life.</p>

<p>This is an area in which we need not be alert, dear sisters. Yes, we must be alert in guarding our hearts, but there is only harm in anxiously watching for (or attempting to claim) a future mate. If we trust God is watching over our futures and is able to bring about His will, then we needn&#8217;t give thought to it at all. And don&#8217;t worry that you&#8217;ll somehow miss it! I&#8217;m sure that when God brings His will about, He&#8217;ll make it so obvious, you couldn&#8217;t miss it. Until then, we are to serve the Lord free of distractions. When we place our hearts in God&#8217;s hands, trusting Him for the future He wants for us, He&#8217;ll give us a peace that is so much more wonderful than worrying about your future.</p>

<h2>God Has a Plan for You</h2>
<p>Another issue young women face is the question, &#8220;What if God doesn&#8217;t have marriage for me?&#8221; This can seem a frightening prospect&#8212;a long life without husband, children, and home. Marriage is a wonderful, honorable thing, and is pleasing unto God&#8212;Who created marriage in the first place. But God does not necessarily have marriage in mind for every one of us. He blesses many with marriage and though He doesn&#8217;t give everyone the same gift, it doesn&#8217;t mean He is not blessing those who are single. He just has different blessings in mind for them. If God gives you a life of singleness it is because He has a special plan for you and is giving you the most effective life of opportunity to serve Him. Remember our goal in life isn&#8217;t to marry! It is rather to serve and obey God&#8212;and we can do this with the life He gives each of us, whether married or unmarried. We just need to patiently wait on God&#8217;s plan to unfold, trusting that what He has in store for us is for His greatest glory and our greatest good.</p>

<p>Though God may give me a future different than I might choose, I am determined to rejoice in it, for I know He loves me so very much, that He has planned all my days. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And in Your book were all written The days that were ordained for me, When as yet there was not one of them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+139%3A16" title="Psalm 139:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 139:16)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New American Standard Bible">NASB</span> And I know that He has a future that is for my greatest blessing and the life wherein I can give God the most glory.</p>


<p>It is so easy for young women to make marriage the &#8220;landmark&#8221; of their life, by over-focusing on it. While we are to prepare for the responsibilities of a wife and mother, there needs to be a proper perspective in that, while it is looked forward to, it is not the main course of thought. Jesus must be our main focus throughout our entire lives, and in the present when we are not married, and thus not needing to devote attention to the duties of the wife. If marriage is over-focused upon, we young women shall undoubtedly grow discontent with the time God has given us now. If our thoughts are in a land of daydreams, can we be alert to how God wants to use us, or how we may enjoy our parents and siblings now?</p>

<p>There is also a need, I believe, to commit to rejoicing in the present time and not allowing it to pass away in idleness in anticipation of the future. Our attention needs to be not on marriage; for as unmarried women, our focus ought to be on Christ. In the same manner, we need to commit to rejoicing in whatever God has for each of our futures. Tell God you will be cheerful, even if He doesn&#8217;t have marriage in store for you. God will provide the contentment and joy if we hand over ourselves to be trained by Him.</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t it wonderful that God has all of our days in His hands? If He has marriage planned for you, He has already set the time and knows the very name of your future husband. He knows what preparation you&#8217;ll need, and even now, is placing incidents in your life, giving you experiences, teaching you His ways and giving you guidance that, if you accept in a manner pleasing to God, are shaping you, as nothing else could, to be a help-meet to the husband God has for you. God can use your interests and particular enjoyments, your past and your future for your preparation. Does this mean we can lie back and watch God work? No. Certainly it means we must work all the more diligently, knowing that God has all the small opportunities, and the life-changing events placed before you in order to develop you into the woman He wants you to be. All those opportunities are for growing in character, in learning lessons and skills and preparing to serve God, whether married or single.</p>

<p>Just as God has already planned the marriage of some young women, He has also planned the lives of other young women to remain single. As He prepares some to be help-meets to their husbands, so He places circumstances and lessons, as well as special blessings and joys in the lives of those whom He is preparing for a future of glorifying God without the daily duties of the wife and mother.</p>

<p>A single life is not something to be avoided at all costs&#8212;a single life is also blessed by God, and full of joys. Isaiah 54 reminds us: <span class="scripture">&#8220; &#8216;Shout for joy, O barren one, you who have borne no child; Break forth into joyful shouting and cry aloud, you who have not travailed; For the sons of the desolate one will be more numerous Than the sons of the married woman,&#8217; says the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>. &#8216;Enlarge the place of your tent; Stretch out the curtains of your dwellings, spare not; Lengthen your cords And strengthen your pegs. For you will spread abroad to the right and to the left. And your descendants will possess nations And will resettle the desolate cities. Fear not, for you will not be put to shame; And do not feel humiliated, for you will not be disgraced&#8230;. For your husband is your Maker.&#8217; &#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+54%3A1-5" title="Isaiah 54:1-5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 54:1-5)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New American Standard Bible">NASB</span></p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t this true? Think of some of the well-known &#8220;unmarried&#8221; women of recent history. I am currently reading <i>A Chance to Die</i>, which is the story of Amy Carmichael. Amy never married, but God blessed her with many hundreds of children! She truly had to &#8220;enlarge her tent.&#8221; She could have married and lived an obscure life in Ireland, but that wasn&#8217;t God&#8217;s plan for her. He had a future for her in ministering to many, many children as a missionary and countless more through her writings. Though Amy is perhaps a unique example, the lesson is still the same. If God doesn&#8217;t have marriage for you, He has already planned it that way and will provide for you the way in which you can best glorify God.</p>

<h2>Dying to the Vision of Marriage</h2>
<p>Young women, we need to die to the vision of marriage. We need to give up our hopes and desires, placing it in God&#8217;s hands (Who is certainly most capable of handling it!). How tightly we wish to hold to it, though! We think by holding to our desire, we are ensuring that we get it, but really just the opposite is true. It is only when we let go of our desire and entrust it in God&#8217;s keeping, that we can be free from the burden of worry that so often pushes girls to reject God&#8217;s plan. It is by knowing God is in control of our futures that we are free to rejoice when He shows us His perfect plan. It is quite natural that young women eagerly look forward to marriage, but it must always be viewed as something God may give, and not something young women can control. This is a vital point, and goes back to some very basic principles. Who is in control?&#8212;God, or me? Am I allowing God to have complete control of my life; in particular, as this is the subject of discussion, of choosing a future husband? Am I allowing God to work in my life by keeping my thoughts and actions pure? Or am I really serving my own self first, and holding to a desire to marry? It is a question that must be asked. Who is in control of your life&#8212;including even your marriage? If we are Christians, our desire should be to make God the King of our lives. If we can come to this point, we will find that whatever life may bring, our refuge and faith will be a stronghold of peace.</p>

<p>We need to live, not seeking ourselves, or fulfilling our own desires, but living under God.</p>

<p>Finally, we need to trust in God&#8217;s perfect timing. Sometimes we tend to grow a little impatient in our eagerness for God&#8217;s will to be brought about. Just because there are no outward signs doesn&#8217;t mean God is asleep! Trust Him, that at His timing He will bring about His will, and know that He doesn&#8217;t need any help! Too often, young women think God isn&#8217;t doing anything, and try to &#8220;step in&#8221; to do things themselves. How this messes up God&#8217;s beautiful plan, though.</p>

<p>Look at this time of waiting for God&#8217;s plan as a special gift from the Father&#8212;an added bonus to enjoy your family for these remaining years, or to gain experience and expertise in an area that interests you. Take this time to continue your preparations for life, building upon lessons of the past, and seeking out new interests. Use your time wisely to be of service to those about you. Most importantly, dear sisters, keep Jesus your focus, the melody of your life. Seek Christ&#8217;s holiness, as you care for the things of God.</p>

<p>He has a plan for you! <span class="scripture">&#8220; &#8216;For I know the plans that I have for you,&#8217; declares the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, &#8216;plans for welfare and not for calamity to give you a future and a hope.&#8217; &#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+29%3A11" title="Jeremiah 29:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jeremiah 29:11)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New American Standard Bible">NASB</span></p>

<h1>What Else?</h1>

<p class="author">Jennifer Quackenbush</p>

<p class="verse">What else must He do for thou to believe
<br />That He loves thee beyond what thou canst receive?
<br />What more than the cross would be for thee proof;
<br />What more than the vow of He Who is truth?</p>

<p class="verse">What else can He wear than a crown-twisted of thorn;
<br />What more can He bear than the mock&#8217;ry and scorn?
<br />How much further can He walk than to Calvary?
<br />Why doubtest thou then that He loveth thee?</p>

<p class="verse">What more than the glories of Heav&#8217;n can He leave;
<br />How far lower than hell can He sink to retrieve
<br />Thy lost, condemned soul from the curse of thy sin,
<br />By becoming thy sin, and the sin of all men?</p>

<p class="verse">How long must He love thee for thou to accept;
<br />How much more limitless is love&#8217;s height and breadth?
<br />How much higher can He raise thee than to be seated above;
<br />Oh, why doubtest thou that thou art His love?</p>

<p class="verse">What else can He say but this, &#8220;It is finished!&#8221;?
<br />His unchanging love cannot e&#8217;e be diminished.
<br />No, nothing can lessen it, naught can abate
<br />A love that in all things is greatest of great.</p>

<p>This story took place in western Colorado, in the year of 1990.</p>

<p>I was four years old and had heard the gospel of salvation even before I was born.</p>

<p>Daddy and Mommy prayed that I would trust the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> as my Savior at a young age. Daddy read me a picture Bible every morning and evening. Sometimes, at night, after both my parents had prayed with me, Daddy would sit on the floor by my bed and tell me the wonderful, true story, found in Revelation.</p>

<p>After Daddy had left, I would lie thinking about what he had told me. I knew that if the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> came right then, to take all believers to Heaven, I would not be one of the people that would go to live with Jesus forever. I wanted to be one of God&#8217;s children.</p>

<p>One night, Daddy came into pray with me. I got out of bed and knelt down beside him. When it was my turn to pray, I started, stopped, turned to Daddy and said, &#8220;Daddy, may I ask Jesus to be my Savior?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daddy looked at me and said, &#8220;Yes, Ruthie!&#8221;</p>

<p>So that night I asked Jesus to be my Savior. He is my Savior; He is everything to me! When I was five years old, I was baptized by my father.</p>

<h2>By Faith, Not Feeling</h2>
<p>Growing up in a Christian home, it was usual to talk about Jesus and my need to get saved. When I was little, I used to be really shy, and so I would never get the courage to talk to my parents about it. Until one day, I was at my friends house, and she was talking to me about the end times. This really scared me! So after a couple of days trying to get the courage, I finally talked to my Dad. He showed me all the truths, but for some reason I thought being saved was to rely on your feeling, and it was so surprising in the following days, when I would still be doing the same old things I did before I supposedly got saved, and then the old doubts and fears started tugging at me again.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t until the summer of 1996, while my church was holding a VBS&#8230;&#8203;and I went. Being 12, at that time, I was in the group with the young teenagers, and to me that was so fun, and I thought I would have a very fun week! But I was wrong&#8230;&#8203;that whole week I kept on doubting again if I was really saved or not. So on July 24, 1996, I talked with my leader, and that day, she showed me how to get saved. I realized that I couldn&#8217;t get saved by relying on my feelings, for they are always prone to change, but by faith that Jesus can love me so much that He died and rose again. And to just believe that He can wash away my sins was so awesome! And I accepted His gift.</p>

<p>Even now when I am saved, I still get those doubts occasionally, but all I need to realize is that it is just Satan trying to tempt me into thinking that! Praise God I can <i>never</i> lose my salvation if I keep my eyes on Jesus! That day I received Christ, I was learning a verse, which has been so much to me since then: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+11%3A25" title="Hebrews 11:25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 11:25)</span></a></span></p>

<h2>Redeemed by the Blood of Christ</h2>
<p class="noindent">Dearest Friends,</p>

<p>Hello in the wonderful name of Jesus! As I sit wondering what to write and what not to mention, I can&#8217;t help but think how blessed I am to be friends with you all. How has our dear Lord and Savior been working in your lives?</p>

<p>I debated sharing the most important thing that has happened to me in my life, but my gracious Redeemer showed me it was only pride which was keeping me from opening my heart with you. I was afraid of what you might think because&#8230;&#8203;I have always professed to be a Christian. But I will now share with you so that you might rejoice with me!</p>

<p>For two years I wanted to go to a one-week Youth Bible School (ages 16-25) in PA, but until this November, it had not worked out. When I again asked in July if I might go, and my parents said yes, I went through a long month of agonizing over if I really wanted to go or not (I now believe it was the Lord who guided me) and finally just in time sent in my application. The first morning there (November 16, 1998), Brother Denny Kenaston preached his first message on &#8220;The Spiritual Man&#8221; (or woman), and the main thing he was trying to impress upon us was that you cannot become spiritual if you have not had a clear conversion. It so unsettled me (the Lord was convicting me). I for so long had doubted my salvation (a simple prayer when 4 1/2 asking Jesus to come into my heart and forgive my sins). I am in no way saying this is not all that might be needed in some people, but for me I had never had peace that I truly was saved since about 12 years of age. The last few years, I had just been continually buried all the misgivings and promptings of my spirit, telling me things were not right with God. I hardly ever read my (now) precious Bible&#8212;it was always a chore, which I knew I should do.</p>

<p>To make a long story short, I struggled inside with so many things during that day and night (at the Bible School). I came to the realization that I did not know the Lord personally, I hadn&#8217;t had my sins forgiven, and I truly had not wanted the Lord to be in complete control of my life. Many tears were shed at that thought! The next day, I was wonderfully counseled by three dear godly people (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+2%3A11-15">Colossians 2:11-15</a>&#8212;this is such a dear portion of scripture to me now!), explaining to me the condition of my own heart. For so long I had believed I was saved, so I needed to be shown all over again what it meant to be born again. I then came to where I knew I must repent and ask forgiveness for all my sins and ask the Lord to come into my heart and be saved. I saw that Jesus died on the cross for my sins that I might be rightly related to Him once more if I only believed. Oh, dear sisters, what a peace I had and have that my sins are forgiven and my life is hid in Christ! I have no doubt, now, that I have been born again. Oh, that I will walk worthy of my precious Savior who forsook all that I might have life everything.</p>

<p>Oh, that I might gain mastery over my flesh (my not wanting to get up early) and live after the promptings of the Holy Spirit that I might be fed by the spirit and filled by the spirit day by day in time alone with God. Above all, during 1999, I want to strive to listen to the voice of the Lord and obey His promptings&#8212;how hard it is for me to lean not on my own understanding, however, I am nothing, and Christ is everything!</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+5%3A23-24" title="I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:23-24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:23-24)</span></a></span></p>

<h2>Snatched from Death</h2>
<p>Three years ago last June, I was supposed to be dying. I was a wreck in soul, mind, and body. I could feel the chilly hand of death upon me. I had been seriously ailing six months and had two doctors. The last one we called examined me and asked me if I knew I was in a serious condition. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;but can&#8217;t you cure me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there is not a doctor in this world that can raise you up.&#8221;</p>

<p>He told me that my stomach had dropped down out of place (this was caused by a fall), and that the first hearty food I ate, I would be a dead woman. He advised me to try to take a little milk or broth; but it seemed my stomach had given completely out, and everything distressed me. I had heart-disease in the worst form. The doctor said my heart beat more than four times as rapidly as it should. When the heart-spells would come on, it just seemed as if my heart would bound out of my body. I would gasp for breath. All sleep seemed to leave me, and the least noise gave me much distress.</p>

<p>I thought of my husband and six children&#8212;three helpless little ones, the baby being only eleven months old. What would become of them? I thought, too, of my lost condition, but was afraid my friends would laugh at me if I mentioned that to them. I was professing and had been a member of the Baptist church twenty-five years. On the morning of June 6, 1906, I felt that my time had come; my friends thought so, too. I felt death closing in upon me. I was growing weaker; my speech seemed to be leaving me; and, oh! the judgment loomed up before me. The thought of meeting God unprepared was too dreadful to describe. I told my husband that I was dying and that I was not prepared to meet my God. He asked me whom I wanted to send for; I said Mr. Tuttle. I had heard him preach the truth a year and a half before this, and I had found fault with it. This troubled me. This brother, who lived about five miles away, came as soon as he got the word.</p>

<p>It seemed an age before he came, though it was not more than two and one half hours. I told him I was not ready to meet Jesus and was dying. He opened the Bible and read the truth to me and asked me if I was willing to accept it. I said I was willing to do anything. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we will ask the Lord now to forgive you.&#8221; He prayed, and I did, and I felt that the burden of sin was gone, and joy and peace filled my soul. Also, I felt much stronger in my body.</p>

<p>Then the elder asked, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe that the Lord can heal you?&#8221;</p>

<p>I said, &#8220;Oh, no! The doctor said no doctor could raise me up.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned to the precious Word again and read that God&#8217;s power never changes&#8212;the same Lord yesterday, today, and forever. After much talk on the brother&#8217;s part, I could believe with all my heart that the Lord could heal me. He said, &#8220;We will now ask the Lord for your healing.&#8221; Kneeling, we asked the Lord to restore me to my home and children and to give me complete healing; and, oh, I felt God&#8217;s healing power pass through my body. I was satisfied the Lord had heard and answered our prayers. The brother anointed me according to <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+5%3A14-15">James 5:14-15</a>.</p>

<p>After resting a little while I got up and dressed. This was about four o&#8217;clock in the afternoon. I walked out in the kitchen. Just then the doctor came. He asked me what I was doing out there. I told him that I didn&#8217;t need him any more, that I had taken the Lord for my physician. He told the rest that it was only excitement and that they would see where I would lie three days from then. I sat that evening at the supper table with the rest of the family and enjoyed a cup of cocoa, and that night I slept well&#8212;the first time I had for months. The next morning I got up and ate what I wanted for breakfast. For a while I felt as if I could not get enough sleep, I had such sweet rest.</p>

<p>A week later, I walked to see one of my neighbors&#8212;a distance of over half a mile&#8212;and back, and in three weeks, I went to the camp meeting at Bliss, which was a blessing to my soul. When I returned, I could eat anything a healthy person could eat, and without the least distress. My stomach has continued in this good condition.</p>

<p>I had all my remedies burned when I was healed, and I have never taken a drop of medicine since.</p>

<h1>Our Appointment: The Prudent Wife of Tomorrow</h1>

</div>


<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>It is so much easier to address this as a letter to you, so I hope you won&#8217;t mind the personal touch it gives. This is directed to you, as my sisters in the Lord, that we would walk worthy of our calling: as Princesses of the Heavenly King.</p>

<p>We find ourselves in the changing years of youth with its perplexities and trials, dreams and joys. It is often that we find our feelings and will oppose each other, troubles and trials abound, and the future seems very large and uncertain. Yet, on the other hand, there is the joy of youth&#8217;s vitality, carefree and sunshine-spanned days where everything looks bright. The command is <span class="scripture">&#8220;Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ecclesiastes+12%3A1" title="Ecclesiastes 12:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ecclesiastes 12:1)</span></a></span> And as we seek to obey, we are beset with questions: What is my responsibility? Which way is right? Where is the Lord leading? Where is my place? I have had opportunity to think about the subject of our place before marriage lately, and I want to pass on the insights the Lord has blessed me with (often through others).</p>

<h2>God&#8217;s Plan for Marriage</h2>
<p>What is God&#8217;s way for marriage and the preparation for it? We read several verses in our family devotions not long ago that touched upon this very subject. First of all we looked at the first man and wife in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+2%3A18-24">Genesis 2:18-24</a>. It is interesting to note that God had Adam name the animals first. He got to study them, saw their relationships to each other, but came out lacking a personal companion of his own. The Lord brought him to see a need, and then filled it. It was to be a partnership of two becoming one. She would be his helpmeet, his compliment, and his missing half. It is God&#8217;s design that we would seek Him to supply our needs, and especially such an important one as this. We can surely see this is contrary to the world&#8217;s way of handling it. They look to fill the lack in their own wisdom and strength, but the outward appearance and understanding of man is greatly limited. No wonder so many marriages have crashed upon the rocks!</p>

<p>In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+19%3A14">Proverbs 19:14</a>, we touch upon an important truth. Fathers may pass on an inheritance of earthly riches, but it is the Lord who supplies the prudent wife. He is the one who can see to the heart and give this most priceless of gifts.</p>

<p>Reading in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Malachi+2%3A13-15">Malachi 2:13-15</a>, we can see that the marriage covenant is a great and solemn thing. It is a serious bond not to be broken. Why did God make it binding? <span class="scripture">&#8220;That he might seek a godly seed.&#8221;</span> In this relationship of giving and receiving where each has a part, yet they are one, God has designed a place where children might be brought up for His glory. How important then that He does the choosing and planning! Let us make room for God&#8217;s way.</p>

<p>So where do we fit in? What is our responsibility? We are tomorrow&#8217;s &#8220;prudent wives,&#8221; Lord willing, and we need to prepare for that place.</p>

<h2>Our Preparation: In God&#8217;s Hands</h2>
<p>If we are to be given (i.e., &#8220;from the Lord&#8221;), we need to be first of all in His hands. Are you in God&#8217;s hands, submitted to the molding of the Potter? I challenge you to seek this place of total consecration and surrender of your will to His. It is dying, surrendering, sacrificing. It is peace and joy and rest. It is being led of the Spirit and walking in the Light. Would you keep back yourself from the One who gave His life for you? Would you deny your Lord His right to your life? Will you not return your all to the One who gave it to begin with?</p>

<p>My life is now not mine, but my Savior&#8217;s&#8212;is this transfer of ownership of great loss to me? No, certainly not! But without realizing it, don&#8217;t we often feel so? Is death to this one desire of such a great consequence after all? Oh, that we would see a higher perspective here! In the center of the Potter&#8217;s wheel is the only place a fit vessel is formed. Will you yield to His touch, O clay? Though the refining is through fire, it brings forth the pure gold.</p>

<h2>The Benefits of a Consecrated Life</h2>
<p>When we are in the Master&#8217;s hand, we are in a place of protection and usefulness. Protected because God is mightier than all the power of the enemy, therefore where He is, we are safe. So we need to trust Him, because there is nothing to fear. Grow in faith, for <span class="scripture">&#8220;without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+11%3A6" title="Hebrews 11:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 11:6)</span></a></span> It is by faith that we can look into the future with full confidence, knowing that our Savior has gone before and prepared the way. (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+10%3A4">John 10:4</a>) Yet there is a cautiousness we need to manifest to be sure of God&#8217;s leading before jumping into things. We need watchfulness and prudence (which I hope to go into more, farther on). It is important to always keep in close touch with our Heavenly Father, bringing every thought in subjection to Him, and hearkening unto His voice.</p>

<p>Now the usefulness comes in. God can only use us if we are 1) submitted to Him and 2) at the place where He wants us to be. These two areas may at times be one and the same, but there are places when we are submitted to God, and He still has to bring us to the place He has designed for us. In these times of drawing nearer to the Lord, seeking His will, and following His direction, we still have many opportunities to be a blessing.</p>

<p>I will give here an illustration. I felt burdened and desire to be useful to the Lord by ministering to children outside of my home. After seeking the Lord&#8217;s guidance in this area I feel led to wait. His timing is not now. His vision is higher, and He knows where I need to grow and deepen in Him first. Perhaps there are other areas of preparation also, but my place now is to learn what He wants to teach me at this time of my life. It might be serving in the home, learning new skills, growing in patience and understanding of the children I am around now. It might just be the Lord wants me to learn more about tarrying before Him, being still &#8220;to know I am God.&#8221; But whatever it may be, I am satisfied to know He is in control, and His way is best for me.</p>

<h2>A Life to Glorify God</h2>
<p>I have spoken here about several of the benefits of a life hid in Christ. Now I wish to bring to your attention an important concept of living wholly for God: this we do that our life may glorify Him. Whereas before we lived to please ourselves, now our chief aim should be to please our Master. In our own strength we can&#8217;t, yet we are not depending on our own strength now, but on Him to whom all power on earth and in heaven is given. It is not I that does the work, but Jesus in me. When we so abide with Him, and He in us, we can live such a life that will honor and please Him. We need to watch and pray that we do not take our eyes off the Savior. But where our treasure is, there will our heart be also. Therefore <span class="scripture">&#8220;Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+3%3A2-4" title="Colossians 3:2-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 3:2-4)</span></a></span></p>

<h2>Overcoming by Faith</h2>
<p>We have a promise of abundant grace if we will only ask. And it is by faith we can take hold of the promise. When the trials of the day overwhelm me, or my patience has about run out, there is a treasure house of reinforcements just around the corner. It is taking the time to go apart and pray that makes all the difference.</p>

<p>Imagine a soldier fighting bravely for the cause, but the battle is a thick one, and his strength is running out. Do you not think if he knew of a place of refreshment he should go there for a space, and then renew the fight when he was strengthened? Or say a general who has held the fort all day against invaders, but his men are wounded and weary. Would not he call for reinforcements if he knew a whole encampment of them were just over the hill?</p>

<p>We, too, are soldiers and the battles are very near and very real. But our General has never yet lost a fight. The secret is to keep close to Him. Abide in Him; trust Him, for He is able. His promise is for us: <span class="scripture">&#8220;God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthias+10%3A13" title="I&nbsp;Corinthias 10:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthias 10:13)</span></a></span> That we might say with Paul, <span class="scripture">&#8220;I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+1%3A12" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 1:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 1:12)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Dear sisters, I, too, have fought battles. It is a struggle, but it pays to press on unto victory. Don&#8217;t give up when the enemy would come in like a flood to tempt and try you sorely. Stand in faith, knowing that God is able. Look to Him, seek His will, embrace His way, and the battle is nearly won. Temptations will come, but we don&#8217;t need to give in. Here is a saying I have heard from an older sister: &#8220;You can&#8217;t stop birds from flying over your head, but you don&#8217;t have to let them build a nest in your hair.&#8221; The closer we are to the Savior, the less of a struggle it will be. We have a solid foundation to stand on if our confidence is solely in God.</p>

<p>The reason I have delved into this topic when discussing the subject of our preparation to be prudent wives is because faith is important to our spiritual growth. Indeed, <span class="scripture">&#8220;without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+11%3A6" title="Hebrews 11:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 11:6)</span></a></span> It is important to have a confidence in God and a chain of victories behind us when we come to the time of entering into a marriage relationship. When we face the crucial decision of choosing a life partner, we need a consecration to God&#8217;s will as at no other time.</p>

<p>As I have been writing, I find this subject to cover more topics than can easily fit into an article, so I will have to summarize my thoughts some. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+1%3A5" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 1:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 1:5)</span></a></span> These three things are necessary to godliness, and our preparation for the future.</p>

<h2>A Good Conscience and Charity</h2>
<p>I have written at some length about the necessity of faith in God, so now I will try to briefly cover the other two. The meaning of a good conscience is one void of offense to God, at peace with Him. This is the vital link of our spiritual life and the purpose of salvation. We need to stay in close touch with God and abide in Him to maintain a good conscience. If we do not, then our love for Him will grow cold and we will sever our link to Him. So let us abide close to the Savior and keep our love hot for Him.</p>

<p>This is also the way for us to have a heart from whence comes charity, or pure divine love. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God&#8230;. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+4%3A7%2C10-12" title="I&nbsp;John 4:7,10-12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 4:7,10-12)</span></a></span> We can see from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+13">I&nbsp;Corinthians 13</a> that charity is a deep, unselfish kind of love. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil&#8230;. Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+13%3A4-5%2C7-8" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 13:4-5,7-8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 13:4-5,7-8)</span></a></span> By God&#8217;s grace we can have this essential element for a smoothly running home, and before that, to begin a marriage rightly. This important fruit will grow in every heart that is hid with Christ in God, for He imparts it.</p>

<h2>A Prudent Wife</h2>
<p>Now we come to the end of the matter. Our preparation is to become a prudent wife, but what is meant by the word <i>prudent</i>? The meaning is primarily that quality which by carefulness and wisdom does seek to avoid evil in the consequence of an action taken. <span class="scripture">&#8220;The wise heart shall be called prudent.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+16%3A21" title="Proverbs 16:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 16:21)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;A prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+22%3A3" title="Proverbs 22:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 22:3)</span></a></span> We can see it also has to do with discretion and not vaunting of ourselves, but rather <span class="scripture">&#8220;walking humbly with [our] God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Micah+6%3A8" title="Micah 6:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Micah 6:8)</span></a></span> It is foresight and practically applied wisdom; therefore by choosing God&#8217;s best way, we are prudent. For by submitting ourselves to God&#8217;s way, we are letting the Master director and designer prepare us to fit into His perfect plan. This truly is the only way of avoiding evil and every crooked path. This is the way of happiness in this life and in the one to come. <span class="scripture">&#8220;But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+4%3A18" title="Proverbs 4:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 4:18)</span></a></span></p>

<h1>We Trusted in God: Part 1</h1>

<p class="author">Mark Spinks</p>

<p>There are so many different marriages between so many different people that one despairs of writing anything that can be useful to such a diverse audience. For each marriage is unique in certain ways; yet there are common threads in the story of all couples that are blessed of God.</p>

<p>I am forty-four years old, happily married and blessed. I have been married for nearly twenty years and am head-over-heels in love with my wife. She seems more dear and precious to me today than on my wedding day and I thought I could not possibly love her more then.</p>

<p>I call her The Sweetest One. It is an apt title for a marvelous human being. She, of course, asserts constantly that she does not deserve such an accolade, that she is merely human like everyone else, etc. I say, &#8220;of course,&#8221; for is this not just what a Sweetest One would say? <span class="scripture">&#8220;Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+31%3A28" title="Proverbs 31:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 31:28)</span></a></span> But the secret of this wonderful blessing is found in the thirtieth verse: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, she shall be praised.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+31%3A30" title="Proverbs 31:30"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 31:30)</span></a></span> It is because she set the Lord first from her youth, and it is because I, too, set the Lord first from my youth that all these things have been added unto us (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+6%3A33">Matthew 6:33</a>).</p>

<p>Long ago, back in the early spring of our lives, both my wife and I were children, raised in separate families. Her parents put together a family, each coming from a separate family culture. And my parents, also, formed a family where no family had been before, each bringing to their marriage various things they had gathered from their parent&#8217;s family. And so it goes, a marvelous and complex web of human life, stretching back over the length and breadth of human history to the very first couple.</p>

<p>The first couple had no family background to bring to their marriage. And they were innocent, free from sin, free even from a history of sin with its accompanying scars. In the perfect plan of the Creator, He created the one from the other. It was a beautiful relationship that was devised by the Master. Woman, taken from the rib of Adam, up by his heart. Do we catch a hint of inspiration in the proceedings? How close did God intend for husband and wife to be? <span class="scripture">&#8220;Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+2%3A24" title="Genesis 2:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 2:24)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A25-28" title="Ephesians 5:25-28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 5:25-28)</span></a></span></p>

<p>It was not the intention of the Divine Architect that the created differences in the man and woman would become a curse to them. The masculine and feminine natures were part of the plan. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Male and female created he them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+1%3A27" title="Genesis 1:27"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 1:27)</span></a></span> The difficulties of each in comprehending the other are also the product of Divine wisdom.</p>

<p>It is a fragile, shining thing, this marvelous and intricate relation that God devised between the two flavors of humanity that He created. And He provided all things necessary for them to blend (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+1%3A3">II&nbsp;Peter 1:3</a>) until it could be said that two individual people from different backgrounds, one male and the other female, would be one, presenting a united front. They would each complement the other, making of the two a complete person in a sense, although still remaining two individual, accountable, eternity-bound souls before God. He looked upon this part of His creation as well as the rest and said it was good. It was devised just as it should be and worked well between Adam and Eve just as planned until they sinned.</p>

<p>This wrecked everything. It is the cause of all the misery, the trouble, the heartache, and the injustices that are everywhere today. Sin has caused, is causing, and will continue to cause all that is fundamentally wrong with folk&#8217;s marriages today. God has a remedy for sin that works. <i>If you want a marriage that works as God planned for it to work, you must take God&#8217;s remedy to destroy sin in you, for sin is the great destroyer of happy marriages.</i></p>

<p>You may say, &#8220;I know some marriages that I think are happy, and the individuals are not living sinless lives.&#8221; Yes, they are happy to the extent that they avoid doing what they know is wrong. The more they avoid it, the better off they will be. It is great wisdom to avoid sinning as much as possible in all areas of our life, such as friendships, business, etc. But the full blessing of what God designed marriage to be is only found in living a holy life by the power of God; indeed, that is the only life worth living at all.</p>

<p>The benefits of a washed heart (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+6%3A11">I&nbsp;Corinthians 6:11</a>), a purified heart (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+1%3A22%2C+Matthew+5%3A8%2C+1+Timothy+1%3A5">I&nbsp;Peter 1:22, Matthew 5:8, I&nbsp;Timothy 1:5</a>), lay a proper foundation for marriage. We can say emphatically that you are not in a condition to properly comprehend what this is really all about until you have experienced a change of heart. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Daniel+12%3A10" title="Daniel 12:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Daniel 12:10)</span></a></span> While this verse in context is about the inability of the unsaved to comprehend the workings of God in events in human history, it is fair and accurate to apply it to the events of human relationships at a man-to-wife level, also.</p>

<p>If you really want a good marriage, get saved. Get delivered and cleaned up by the power of God. Get an experience where you love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, and strength, and your neighbor as yourself, and yourself last. Unsaved people tend to have it the other way around. Many go into marriage with the thought (both of them) of what they may get, instead of what they can give. They have not been delivered from the <span class="scripture">&#8220;old man, [and] put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+4%3A22%2C24" title="Ephesians 4:22,24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 4:22,24)</span></a></span> They have not learned from God how to walk in the Spirit and not fulfill the lusts of the flesh (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+5%3A16">Galatians 5:16</a>). The foundation for an accurate understanding of the marriage relationship is not properly laid.</p>

<p>An unsaved life is basically a selfish life, dedicated to the satisfaction of one&#8217;s self life. The ordinary difficulties of the married relationship are acerbated by the condition of the heart. The changed heart makes it vastly easier to come to grips with the very real challenges of married life. We read that all they that marry <span class="scripture">&#8220;shall have trouble in the flesh.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+7%3A28" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 7:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 7:28)</span></a></span> How could it be otherwise? To take two different human beings, one male and one female, from different backgrounds and parents, and place them together to form a home and raise little ones&#8212;of course they will have trouble in the flesh! They will have a myriad of adjustments. If they are not both born again, filled with the Holy Spirit, and living for God instead of themselves, it is much, much harder.</p>

<p>Human wisdom has devised a multitude of ways, customs, and traditions to minimize the frictions and to enable the married couple to make a go of it. One tradition holds that the prospective wife be chosen at a early age and goes to live in the prospective mother-in-law&#8217;s home. She learns from the fiance&#8217;s mother how to cook for him and what are the ways of his family in discipline, values, etc. This has a show of wisdom. But what does it teach him in comprehending his wife? <span class="scripture">&#8220;Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A7" title="I&nbsp;Peter 3:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 3:7)</span></a></span> This is the problem with human wisdom&#8212;it provides a lopsided solution.</p>

<p>Have you ever thought that life is basically backwards? Consider! We make our most fundamental decisions when we are young and do not know what we are doing. Then we live with the consequences. This is especially true of marriage. One needs to have been married for many years, raised a family, and seen the success/failure rate of many other marriages from that perspective before one is qua1ified to get married in the first place. This, of course, is impossible.</p>

<p>I am satisfied that God knew we would not know what we were doing. He meant for us to voluntarily trust Him by turning from our own ideas and opinions and placing our hand in His hand for guidance. He designed the thing so that we would absolutely need a guide.</p>

<p>That is where the story of my wife and myself begins. It is the story of how two of the great multitude of humanity humbled themselves before Him who knows all things. Of how He helped them to die to self. Of how He put them together. There are many others like it, although it doesn&#8217;t seem like it. I say it doesn&#8217;t seem like it because most of God&#8217;s creation has ignored the vital truths expressed in this little writing and have/are pursuing their own way. A small percentage of mankind is truly happy. A small percentage has found the fullness that the Master Designer intended. To the extent that others have gotten closer to that pattern, to that extent they have been blessed. My wife and I are just people, too. What has made the difference with us is allowing God to have His way. Anyone who does this will be blessed.</p>

<p>When a young teenager, the Lord visited me and caused me to feel the great necessity of yielding myself completely to Him. <span class="scripture">&#8220;My son, give me thine heart.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+23%3A26" title="Proverbs 23:26"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 23:26)</span></a></span> Oh, how much trouble and confusion the Lord would spare each of us if we would let Him have His way! <i>He knows how to do it.</i> He can guide each of us safely through the hazards of this life. <i>He knows what is best for you.</i></p>

<p>I wanted to do well; I wanted to do the right thing. The Lord helped me to realize the great truth in the following lines.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Only one life&#8212;&#8217;twill soon be past;
<br />Only what&#8217;s done for Christ will last.&#8221;</p>

<p>I wanted my life to count; I wanted to do what was worthwhile. The Lord helped me so much. He helped me to die to self; He led me into truth and helped me to pay the price to buy truth (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+23%3A23">Proverbs 23:23</a>). I did not know it, but He was preparing me constantly for the big decisions that lay ahead. Everything seemed big at the time, but looking back, I see how thoroughly and lovingly my heavenly Father was teaching me to lean upon Him and not to my own understanding (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+3%3A5-6">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>). <i>How useless would have been my desire to do right without His active leading and preparation.</i></p>
