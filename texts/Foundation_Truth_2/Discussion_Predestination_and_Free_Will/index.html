<h1>Discussion: Predestination and Free Will</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>On April 21, 2000, three men met for lunch. All three agree that salvation requires a change in the heart wrought by God. Two of the men believed that God has given to men the ability to determine whether they will receive that heart change. The other man believed that God has predetermined who He will deal with, and that His dealings are irresistible. These three had discussed these thoughts before over a number of years, earnestly, sincerely, with a deep love and burden for each other. The idea was advanced at this luncheon that the discussions should be recorded and publicized for the benefit of others.</p>

<p>The scripture was quoted,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Malachi+3%3A16" title="Malachi 3:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Malachi 3:16)</span></a></span>
It was commented that the adherents of different opinions usually just spoke often among themselves (to those of like mind), and that we would never get anywhere with respect to being of the same mind as long as those conditions prevailed. All agreed that we needed to speak
<span class="scripture">&#8220;often one to another,&#8221;</span>
humbly and carefully exploring the differences between us. All agreed that strife must be avoided at all costs.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A24" title="2 Timothy 2:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (2 Timothy 2:24)</span></a></span>
Also, the scripture gives a good standard for such discussions, both negatively and positively. Negatively,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about [obsessed with] questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth&#8230;&#8203;from such withdraw thyself.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+6%3A4-5" title="1 Timothy 6:4-5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (1 Timothy 6:4-5)</span></a></span>
But positively, consent
<span class="scripture">&#8220;to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+6%3A3" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 6:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 6:3)</span></a></span>
Each of the three respects the sincerity of the others; we pray (and ask you to pray, too) that this effort will be profitable to our souls and to yours.</p>

<p>Several years back during a visit, one of these men spoke wistfully of the &#8220;Whitehorse Inn,&#8221; a place which folks on both sides of the Calvinist-Arminian debate, back in the time of John Wesley and George Whitefield, would meet and discuss freely&#8212;a sort of &#8220;neutral ground.&#8221; During this recent luncheon, it was mentioned how George Whitefield was asked if would he see John Wesley in heaven? &#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; he is supposed to have replied. &#8220;I will not see him there, for he will be much closer to the throne than I.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is heartening to ponder on how much they loved each other&#8212;these men of another time in human history. Their disagreements were profound and harmful; but, as always, God&#8217;s children loved each other anyway. And you can trace the effects of the grace of God working in their lives as they attempted to deal with their differences.</p>

<p>Each of the three believe the way we do because of our love for God, not because we have some religious &#8220;turf&#8221; to defend. Very few that differ so greatly on the issues of &#8220;Free Will/Sovereign Grace&#8221; have enjoyed the blessed fellowship that we enjoy!
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes. And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A23-25" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 2:23-25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 2:23-25)</span></a></span>
We welcome any questions or comments you readers may have.</p>

<p>Surely, He Who is bigger, so incomprehensibly bigger than our need, can help us with this. He Who prayed,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+17%3A21" title="John 17:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 17:21)</span></a></span>
Yea,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+1%3A10" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 1:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 1:10)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Has God given man the ability to determine his eternal destiny, or has He predestined him to be saved or lost?</p>

<p>Both teachings cannot be correct. We pray the Lord will help us to explore this subject in the Bible. If we rightly divide the Word of Truth by the help of the Spirit of Truth, we can be
<span class="scripture">&#8220;a workman that needeth not to be ashamed.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A15" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 2:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 2:15)</span></a></span>
This we greatly desire. Oh, we want to do it right! We want His approval on us.</p>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">Editor&#8217;s Note: All the participants are busy family men, one with a brand new baby, and others involved in recent trips in the Lord&#8217;s work, so the first round of actual &#8220;discussion&#8221; is not yet complete, and is being held for the next issue, Lord willing.</p>
