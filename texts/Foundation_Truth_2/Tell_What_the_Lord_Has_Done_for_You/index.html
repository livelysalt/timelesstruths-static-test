<p>&#8220;God will prune His people but not hew them down; the right hand of His mercy knows what the left hand of His severity is doing.&#8221; (J. A. Chapman)</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ: Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+1%3A7-8" title="I&nbsp;Peter 1:7-8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 1:7-8)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Greetings in Jesus&#8217; Holy Name! I hope this finds you well. I wanted to tell you what a wonderful blessing this last issue of Dear Princess was (<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_10/index.html" title="Dear Princess 10">Summer 1999</a>). Thank you&#8230;&#8203;for putting out an inspiring and Godly magazine free of charge&#8230;&#8203;the content is great; <i>especially</i> this last issue. I was very encouraged by the theme. I, too, have pondered the whole idea of focusing on the Lord Jesus and just letting Him have His way in My everyday life, and in my future. It&#8217;s good not to make plans and dream of the future if you have given it to the Lord! Last year I gave the next seven years of my life to the Lord for his service. He has been faithful to guide me and keep me in His way. Though I might not choose singleness, I will gladly be single if that is His will for me. Some people might say, &#8220;How could you do <i>that</i>? I think that if He gave His life for me, how could I give any less back to Him? A week or so ago, I copied excerpts from
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+7">I&nbsp;Corinthians 7</a> onto a 5 by 7 card. I have it on my mirror so I can see it often&#8230;&#8203;maybe you&#8217;d enjoy these precious verses:</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;I say therefore to the unmarried&#8230;. It is good for them if they abide even as I&#8230;. Let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God. Art thou loosed from a [husband]? seek not a [husband]&#8230;. that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction&#8230;. She is happier if she so abide, after my judgement: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+7%3A8%2C24%2C27%2C35%2C40" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 7:8,24,27,35,40"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 7:8,24,27,35,40)</span></a></span></p>

<p>May you continue to grow in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ!</p>

<p class="signature">Your fellow sister in Jesus,<br />Mollie Jo Cassidy&#8212;<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+3%3A7-10">Philippians 3:7-10</a><br />Fort Worth, TX</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Note: We appreciate the sincerity of Mollie and her desire to please the Lord and stay consecrated to His will. We did want to mention that we believe consecrating the next seven years of our lives is a good step, but only a step, considering that God wants <i>full</i> consecration for our entire life. Giving up a portion of our lives seems to indicate that the rest will be for ourselves. We must give God all&#8212;childhood, girlhood, womanhood, married life (if this is His will), old age&#8212;every aspect and time in our lives until He calls us home to heaven. If the Lord calls us to be married, we will need every bit of the full consecration that we gave before as we will certainly not be without trials&#8212;God is too merciful to do that! It is vital that we do not get cheated out of the full peace and joy of entire consecration with a partial giving up of self and self&#8217;s ways.</p>

<p>If the thought is meant that we are to give amount of years in <i>singleness</i> devoted to God, does this not seem but a lack of surrender to His Divine will, though it may look good on the surface? Dear sisters, let us not fall into the trap of &#8220;planning for God&#8221;&#8212;seven or ten or even five years of &#8220;singleness&#8221; sounds noble and self-sacrificing&#8212;&#8220;I will not marry during the next four years, I will spend this time in absolute devotion to God and His will and purpose.&#8221; But what if it is the Lord&#8217;s will for you to serve Him in marriage during this time? What if this is how He wants your absolute devotion? Marriage is not second-class service&#8212;neither is singlehood nor any other stage in life. Singleness is not better&#8212;nor marriage&#8212;but being in the center of the circle of the will of God is best. Sisters, let us yield our heart, soul, mind and strength&#8212;all&#8212;to God that He may direct our path into His perfectness. He knows best.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Had I the choosing of my pathway<br />In blindness I should go astray,<br />And wander far away in darkness,<br />Nor reach that land of endless day.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;God&#8217;s way is best, I will not murmur,<br />Although the end I may not see;<br />Where&#8217;er He leads I&#8217;ll meekly follow,<br />God&#8217;s way is best, is best for me.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Gods_Way_Is_Best/index.html" title="God's Way Is Best">*</a></p>

<p>My dear sisters in Christ,</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;As it is written: No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love Him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+2%3A9" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 2:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 2:9)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New International Version">NIV</span> Isn&#8217;t that such a beautiful verse for God&#8217;s children? Surely we serve a God who is so rich in His loving kindness! I sit here at the table rejoicing in Jesus who is so merciful and perfect in His dealing with me&#8230;&#8203;</p>

<p>I especially thank Him tonight for sending you girls into my life. You have been such a Godly encouragement to me through your lives and your magazine. Keep on keeping on for Jesus&#8230;&#8203;</p>

<p>The latest issue of Dear Princess (<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_10/index.html" title="Dear Princess 10">Summer 1999</a>) was so rich and full. I very much desire to continue receiving it. The poem, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_10/What_Else/index.html" title="Dear Princess 10/What Else?">What Else?</a>&#8221; almost sent the tears spilling. What else could Christ have done to show His love towards us? Nothing&#8212;what a glorious thought. He has poured His love into us&#8230;. How can the world so openly mock and reject His perfect love? I cannot understand the cold hearts of today. My heart cries. Thank you for printing &#8220;What Else&#8221;&#8212;it touched me deeply.</p>

<p>Yesterday found me very contemplative. I heard of a tragedy and it left me deep in thought the rest of the day. I questioned the Lord, &#8220;Why did you allow such a thing to happen? I cannot understand it.&#8221; God taught me several lessons through this and gave me comfort in several verses which I&#8217;ll share with you. I hope they might be a comfort to someone else&#8230;.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Though you have made me see troubles, many and bitter, you will restore my life again; from the depths of the earth you will again bring me up.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+71%3A20" title="Psalm 71:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 71:20)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New International Version">NIV</span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Those who sow in tears will reap songs of joy. He who goes out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carring sheaves with him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+126%3A5-6" title="Psalm 126:5-6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 126:5-6)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New International Version">NIV</span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;For men are not cast off by the Lord forever. Though He brings grief, he will show compassion, so great is His unfailing love. For He does not willingly bring affliction or grief to the children of men.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Lamentations+3%3A31-33" title="Lamentations 3:31-33"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Lamentations 3:31-33)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New International Version">NIV</span></p>

<p>May we always remember that God&#8217;s ways are not our ways. He sees the whole picture. He knows exactly what He is doing in all things.</p>

<p>Today was a busy day of sewing. Mom and I were able to complete one dress and make progress on another. Oh, my hands seem so clumsy next to Mom&#8217;s sure steady hands as we both handle the fabric. I am learning to be a better seamstress inch by inch&#8230;&#8203;&#8220;stitch by stitch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yesterday we were able to gather three baskets full of apples. We are hoping to can apple pie filling this Monday. I can just smell the apple pies coming out of the oven on a snowy December day.</p>

<p>I very much enjoyed the article, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_10/Dying_to_the_Vision_of_Marriage/index.html" title="Dear Princess 10/Dying to the Vision of Marriage">Dying to the Vision of Marriage</a>,&#8221; as well as <a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_10/Our_Appointment/index.html" title="Dear Princess 10/Our Appointment">Laura&#8217;s article</a> on being the prudent wife of tomorrow. Thank you for printing articles which exhort and encourage.</p>

<p>I will close with this hymn. The words really &#8220;hit home.&#8221; Keep your eyes on Jesus! I will be praying for you, dear sisters.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;I wonder, have I done my best for Jesus?<br />Who died upon the cruel tree?<br />To think of His great sacrifice at Calvary!<br />I know the Lord expects the best from me.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;I wonder have I cared enough for others,<br />Or have I let them die alone?<br />I might have helped a wanderer to my Savior,<br />The seed of precious life I might have sown.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;No longer will I stay in the valley&#8212;<br />I&#8217;ll climb to mountain heights above;<br />The world is dying now for want of someone<br />Who will tell them of the Savior&#8217;s matchless love.</p>

<p class="verse refrain_line">Refrain:</p><p class="verse refrain">&#8220;How many are the lost that I have lifted?<br />How many are the chains I&#8217;ve set free?<br />I wonder, have I done my best for Jesus,<br />When He has done so much for me?&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">&#8212;E. Edwin Young</p>

<p>I love you!</p>

<p class="signature">Rejoicing in Him,<br />Lauren Mong<br />Kingwood, WV</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p class="noindent">Greetings in the Precious Name of the Lord!</p>

<p>&#8230;&#8203;There is such a great sin in turning to anything or anybody to make you feel like &#8220;somebody.&#8221; Oh, what a price has been paid by the King of Glory; the worth of us being His own life&#8217;s blood! Surely the worth of that sacrifice to buy us back from bondage, united to Himself, makes &#8220;nobodies&#8221; so loved and treasured.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be found in Him&#8221; will be the title of an article [I hope to write]. Please pray that the Lord will provide time in the word, clear thoughts and words for it. What a struggle it seems for me, but it has become labor sweet for Him. He is with me, and in this work [of writing], so it is good.</p>

<p>Love and richest blessings of Heaven to you,</p>
