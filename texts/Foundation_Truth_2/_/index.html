<h1>Purpose of <i>Foundation Truth</i></h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Folks,</p>

<p>Greetings in the name of Jesus, our Friend and Redeemer, who gave Himself for us, the guiltless for the guilty, that we might be saved.
Without Him, we can do nothing, but by Him, we can do all things He wants us to do (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+4%3A13">Philippians 4:13</a>).
</p>

<p>We are leaning heavily on the Lord to help us in this task. We want to be of assistance to those who desire to live for God and make heaven their home, and we want to work with the Holy Spirit in stirring and awakening all others to the great necessity of doing so.</p>

<p>That is the purpose of this publication. If we can, by God&#8217;s help, be of usefulness to even one soul, then all labor and effort will be more than repaid.</p>

<p>Now we wish to state that we love everyone, even the vast majority of you whom we have not met. How can we say this? With joy, and an inward assurance, I can declare it because
<span class="scripture">&#8220;the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+5%3A5" title="Romans 5:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 5:5)</span></a></span>
There is no one, at all, whom we resent, or to whom we bear a grudge. We do not have it &#8220;in&#8221; for anyone, nor are we offended at anyone.</p>

<p>A brother once remarked to someone he had never met before that he had a past acquaintance with them of a sort. Then he explained that he was acquainted with God, and God was acquainted with them, and so he had a sort of indirect acquaintance with them. It is because God knows you and loves you, dear reader, that we venture to write and hope. He is able to give what is needed.</p>

<p>We are but fellow pilgrims on the narrow way, rejoicing in our freedom and walking in the light that has shone upon our pathway.
There are things we are persuaded of (deeply) that accompany salvation (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+6%3A9">Hebrews 6:9</a>),
and there are things that we are not certain about. But our trust is in God. He has brought us safely thus far, and we trust Him to lead us safely home.</p>

<p>We could outline a list of what we are convicted of in our heart and a list of questions which occur to our mind. But I am not convinced that it would be profitable for you or for us to do so. Why? In God&#8217;s great plan of guidance and correction, you may not be at the same lesson junctures. It may not make sense at this time, although it may be just what you need at another time. We are asking the Lord to guide us. We are asking Him to hover over the paper as you read it and to assist you in getting hold of what is relevant and profitable, spiritually, to you at the time you read it.</p>

<p>If you feel it is necessary for you to know exactly where we stand on a particular principle, please contact us. Write us or call. But, if you read the paper over an extended period of time, we feel certain you will know, and we trust and hope that it will be of benefit to you.</p>

<p><b>To properly understand the Bible, it is necessary to be under the same Holy Spirit that inspired it to be written.</b> With Brother John, we must be <span class="scripture">&#8220;in the Spirit&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelations+1%3A10" title="Revelations 1:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelations 1:10)</span></a></span> to see and know and understand.
Only the Lord can enlighten the eyes of our understanding (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+1%3A18">Ephesians 1:18</a>),
and give skill and understanding (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Daniel+9%3A22%3B+1%3A17">Daniel 9:22; 1:17</a>).
The Lord will teach us to rightly divide the Word of Truth, producing a workman that needeth not to be ashamed (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A15">II&nbsp;Timothy 2:15</a>).
</p>

<p>Having been taught in this way by this wonderful Teacher for some time, we declare with great joy that we are
<span class="scripture">&#8220;not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+1%3A16" title="Romans 1:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 1:16)</span></a></span>
We would happily shout to all the glorious news: <b>IT WORKS!</b> It does just exactly as promised. Not a single part has failed in any way. Hallelujah! It is gloriously true and accurate. In spite of all who have failed to find, the treasure is yet in the field,
and there are those who have paid the full price to buy the same, and are rejoicing in full possession (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+13%3A44">Matthew 13:44</a>).
</p>

<p>If you have been hindered&#8212;if you are disillusioned&#8212;if you are hurt&#8212;bewildered&#8212;confused&#8212;desperate&#8212;in great need&#8212;we would declare to you the results of our own personal experience with God and His way: <b>IT WORKS!</b> And we would say to you, &#8220;Lift up your head. Look and live. <b>It was designed by God Himself to work in your case.</b>&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;For me the promise sure was made,<br />And sealed on Calvary.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/The_Unchanging_Word/index.html" title="The Unchanging Word">*</a></p>

<p>Finally, we ask an interest in your prayers.
Ye who love the Lord, would you help hold up our hands? (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Exodus+17%3A8-13">Exodus 17:8-13</a>).

<h1>Discussion: Predestination and Free Will</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>On April 21, 2000, three men met for lunch. All three agree that salvation requires a change in the heart wrought by God. Two of the men believed that God has given to men the ability to determine whether they will receive that heart change. The other man believed that God has predetermined who He will deal with, and that His dealings are irresistible. These three had discussed these thoughts before over a number of years, earnestly, sincerely, with a deep love and burden for each other. The idea was advanced at this luncheon that the discussions should be recorded and publicized for the benefit of others.</p>

<p>The scripture was quoted,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Malachi+3%3A16" title="Malachi 3:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Malachi 3:16)</span></a></span>
It was commented that the adherents of different opinions usually just spoke often among themselves (to those of like mind), and that we would never get anywhere with respect to being of the same mind as long as those conditions prevailed. All agreed that we needed to speak
<span class="scripture">&#8220;often one to another,&#8221;</span>
humbly and carefully exploring the differences between us. All agreed that strife must be avoided at all costs.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A24" title="2 Timothy 2:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (2 Timothy 2:24)</span></a></span>
Also, the scripture gives a good standard for such discussions, both negatively and positively. Negatively,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about [obsessed with] questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth&#8230;&#8203;from such withdraw thyself.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+6%3A4-5" title="1 Timothy 6:4-5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (1 Timothy 6:4-5)</span></a></span>
But positively, consent
<span class="scripture">&#8220;to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+6%3A3" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 6:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 6:3)</span></a></span>
Each of the three respects the sincerity of the others; we pray (and ask you to pray, too) that this effort will be profitable to our souls and to yours.</p>

<p>Several years back during a visit, one of these men spoke wistfully of the &#8220;Whitehorse Inn,&#8221; a place which folks on both sides of the Calvinist-Arminian debate, back in the time of John Wesley and George Whitefield, would meet and discuss freely&#8212;a sort of &#8220;neutral ground.&#8221; During this recent luncheon, it was mentioned how George Whitefield was asked if would he see John Wesley in heaven? &#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; he is supposed to have replied. &#8220;I will not see him there, for he will be much closer to the throne than I.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is heartening to ponder on how much they loved each other&#8212;these men of another time in human history. Their disagreements were profound and harmful; but, as always, God&#8217;s children loved each other anyway. And you can trace the effects of the grace of God working in their lives as they attempted to deal with their differences.</p>

<p>Each of the three believe the way we do because of our love for God, not because we have some religious &#8220;turf&#8221; to defend. Very few that differ so greatly on the issues of &#8220;Free Will/Sovereign Grace&#8221; have enjoyed the blessed fellowship that we enjoy!
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes. And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A23-25" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 2:23-25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 2:23-25)</span></a></span>
We welcome any questions or comments you readers may have.</p>

<p>Surely, He Who is bigger, so incomprehensibly bigger than our need, can help us with this. He Who prayed,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+17%3A21" title="John 17:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 17:21)</span></a></span>
Yea,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+1%3A10" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 1:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 1:10)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Has God given man the ability to determine his eternal destiny, or has He predestined him to be saved or lost?</p>

<p>Both teachings cannot be correct. We pray the Lord will help us to explore this subject in the Bible. If we rightly divide the Word of Truth by the help of the Spirit of Truth, we can be
<span class="scripture">&#8220;a workman that needeth not to be ashamed.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A15" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 2:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 2:15)</span></a></span>
This we greatly desire. Oh, we want to do it right! We want His approval on us.</p>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">Editor&#8217;s Note: All the participants are busy family men, one with a brand new baby, and others involved in recent trips in the Lord&#8217;s work, so the first round of actual &#8220;discussion&#8221; is not yet complete, and is being held for the next issue, Lord willing.</p>

<h1>Which One Is Right?</h1>

<h2>God Has a Way</h2>
<p>God is still saving people today,
delivering them from the kingdom of darkness, translating them into the kingdom of His dear Son (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+1%3A13">Colossians 1:13</a>).
Each precious redeemed soul is born of the Spirit into the kingdom of God (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+3%3A5">John 3:5</a>).
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+87%3A5" title="Psalm 87:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 87:5)</span></a></span>
Each child of God is born into the family of God,
that extensive family which lives both in heaven and on the earth and is kept in His name (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+3%3A14-15">Ephesians 3:14-15</a>).
Those who are not born again cannot see them as a family (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+3%3A3">John 3:3</a>)
or comprehend their divinely wrought relationship, but He who redeemed them from the world knows every one of His children.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A19" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 2:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 2:19)</span></a></span>
He added them to His church by saving them (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+2%3A47">Acts 2:47</a>).
</p>

<p>It was never the purpose of the Lord that they be scattered and divided from each other, but He has always intended that they be one in Him.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+12%3A12" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 12:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 12:12)</span></a></span>
The unity of God&#8217;s children, with one mind and one mouth, glorifies Him (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+15%3A6">Romans 15:6</a>).
The lack of unity between God&#8217;s little children disgraces Him and His salvation; it causes rejoicing in hell and skepticism on the earth.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+17%3A21" title="John 17:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 17:21)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>It grieves the great heart of God to see His children scattered as they are today: confused, deceived, carried about by winds of doctrine, by the sleight of man and cunning craftiness, separated from other members of the family, out of place from where the Spirit of Truth would guide them.</p>

<h2>The Idol of Party</h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The divisions of the Christian church, as they now exist, are a prominent cause of the low state of piety among believers; the greatest single obstacle which now exists to the spread and triumph of our religion in the world.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>The moment you separate the church of Christ into distinct divisions, you set up the idol of party. Success or adversity will no longer affect the mind simply as they touch the cause of Christ, but they will be felt, also, as affecting &#8220;our side&#8221; or &#8220;our church.&#8221; It is not Christ and His cause to which their whole thoughts and desires are now turned; the idol of party has now been set up, and it claims, and receives, part of their regard. The man, I think, is almost more than human that can wholly avoid this influence, at least after he has been long identified with any branch of the church. It is an influence which is all the time at work. The idol has been set up to divide the heart from the blessed Savior and His holy service; and its influence is as ceaseless as the existence of the cause. And this party feeling is, as we have seen, the essence of all sin, so that sinful desire is blended continually in the heart with its love to Christ, and pollutes the worship which it offers Him.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>It mingles poison with the streams of salvation that flow to the soul through the church, and casts a blight upon its budding fruit.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>The divisions of Christ&#8217;s people beget and stimulate continually that opposite spirit of rivalry and contention, which is the spirit of the world.</p>

<p>How thankful we are to be free of the spirit of rivalry and contention! Praise the name of Jesus for His mercy unto us! We are deeply interested in everything that is of God and are equally uninterested in everything that is not.</p>

<p>And He has a heavenly remedy that will cure our reproach. If we will draw near&#8212;so very near&#8212;to Him, so near that all that matters is what He says and what His Spirit teaches, He will deliver us from groups and parties by taking the group and party spirit out of us, thus bring us into unity with Himself and consequently with all other of His children who will pay the price to love Him and His ways supremely, above all else. This experience will spoil us for everything but Him and His family, His government, His church.</p>

<p>For the group/party spirit is a rival of God for our affections, and to thus divide our love for God with love for a group, a church, &#8220;my church,&#8221; is to set up an idol in the heart where He, and He alone, should be worshipped.</p>

<p>Now, as with all forms of sin that tempt, this sin of group loyalty is very subtle, and we need the help of the Spirit of God to check us and illuminate the Word of God that deals with this area to get deliverance and keep deliverance by the power of God. God is able to keep us from idolatry and bring us into adjustment with His plan as revealed in His Word that will keep us clear of all entanglements which keep us from loving Him with all our heart, our mind, our soul. The Lord will help us to let go of our Ishmaels, to forsake our attempts to get His approval on our choice, and to say in the words of the poet,</p>

<p>How good the Lord is! How precious and effective is His deliverance! How perfect are His ways!</p>

<h2>The Spiritual Condition of the Corinthian Congregation Considered</h2>
<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+14%3A12" title="Proverbs 14:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 14:12)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>It seemed natural and appropriate to the children of God at Corinth to have
differing opinions about Paul and Apollos (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+3%3A4">I&nbsp;Corinthians 3:4</a>).
Nothing in the scriptural record indicates that they <i>meant</i> to divide into two camps about these two brothers. But something was in them that caused that. <b>It was not in Apollos and Paul,</b> for they were not carnal. Paul and Apollos had better victory. God had done something for them which those other brethren yet lacked.</p>

<p>The unity that Paul and Apollos had was not a negotiated one. Reading the scriptural record carefully in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+3">I&nbsp;Corinthians 3</a>
does not give the impression at all that Paul and Apollos had discussed the problem at Corinth and chose to say in effect, &#8220;We&#8217;re together.&#8221; They were one and had the same mind and judgment, but the essence of that unity came from each being in unity with God. This produced a oneness in Him that did not depend on careful posturing and positioning with each other. The Spirit of God within taught them the way of God, and they each followed the Lord with all their heart because they loved Him. Their trueness to Him and guidance by the same Spirit of Truth kept them together in Him. I haven&#8217;t the slightest doubt, that if it had been Apollos whose words were recorded about conditions in the Corinthian brethren, he would have had the same mind and judgment. We catch a glimpse of the depth of victory these ministering brethren had when we read,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+4%3A6" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 4:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 4:6)</span></a></span>
It is the same victory spoken of in the scripture,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+5%3A16" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 5:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 5:16)</span></a></span>
This depth of victory delivers us from the fear of man and from partiality. It elevates us above the desire to be greater than others and enables us to be content to be little, the servant of others. Praise the Lord! No desire for big I&#8217;s and little you&#8217;s! Jesus takes it out.</p>

<p>Paul pointed the Corinthian brethren to that same Christ that kept him and Apollos in such wonderful unity. His entire burden for them was that they would be delivered from their carnality. He held before them a burden that they would enter into what John called perfect love. It is translated in the
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+13">13th chapter of I&nbsp;Corinthians</a>
as <i>charity</i>&#8212;supreme Divine love in the heart of the child of God, the more perfect way. How well he knew that the Lord had a cure for their lack of unity! How he hungered for them to get a hold of it! How thoroughly he understood the consequences of not doing so!</p>

<p>Only by a work of God that would purge them of carnality and purify their love to Jesus, could they ever be in Biblical unity. Only this would enable them to walk on a higher plane, the heritage and birthright of God&#8217;s children, purchased on the cross. Their current condition:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+3%3A3" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 3:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 3:3)</span></a></span>
The conclusion is inescapable&#8212;God has an experience for us that will enable us to walk above carnality, above the natural fleshly ways of men. Without this work done within us, the unity that Jesus prayed about is unobtainable.</p>

<h2>The Many Ways of Men</h2>
<p>Everywhere we look about, we see people building their organization. If the Lord were to never work among any of them at all, how sad would be the plight of the souls in those places! In great mercy, the Lord continues to deal with souls. Some have more light than others; some are in great darkness. Some are so cold, formal, and corrupt, that we fear there is not anyone alive spiritually in there at all. They are like the church that the outcast was trying to get into. He had really gotten saved and thought that he should worship in the local congregation, but they were not right and did not want him. They told him to live it a year, expecting him to give it up. But he did not, and by God&#8217;s help, lived it all year and then reapplied. Then they just turned him down. So he went and prayed about it. &#8220;Lord,&#8221; he said, &#8220;they won&#8217;t let me in. And I want so much to worship with Your people.&#8221; According to the story, the Lord replied and told him that <i>He</i> had been trying to get in that church for years. If someone were to get saved in such a place, it would be very difficult to live spiritually without leaving. There is no food for the soul; it is a hostile environment for whole-hearted living unto God. Darkness is mistaken for light, light for darkness. God&#8217;s little children are persecuted because they do not &#8220;fit&#8221; with the prevailing spiritual culture.</p>

<p>In other places, there is a considerable amount of understanding, and, in some cases, a godly heritage from those back in the past. That is valuable. But it means a great deal to live up to that understanding. Alas,
how many have a form of godliness (even the Biblical form), but deny the power thereof (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+3%3A5">II&nbsp;Timothy 3:5</a>)!
Perhaps they are close&#8212;an excellent counterfeit. Perhaps one of their main failings is right along this line of truth. A willingness to accept those whom they (the more spiritually-minded) know that Jesus would not accept in positions of leadership. A little lack of trueness to God to keep a group together, all with the thought to do them good. But it is off the right path. There are some successes, but the purity, the fullness of blessing, slips away. The Spirit of God is grieved, His gentle voice unheeded in things. Another spirit is gaining headway. There is much good spiritual food, but there is also death in the pot.
Along with good, wholesome instruction are mingled things that are not of God (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Kings+4%3A40">II&nbsp;Kings 4:40</a>).
He who lets does let. The purity of the child of God&#8217;s love is much tried.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Lovest thou me more than these?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+21%3A15" title="John 21:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 21:15)</span></a></span>
is the question. Who do you love more: Jesus, or others who are advocating a little different way than the way in which the Spirit of God does lead? Human wisdom becomes mixed with the heritage of spiritual understanding. Things are reverenced which God does not reverence. Little by little, there is a letting down, a dulling, a loss of vision. Apostasy, individually and collectively, is the awful result. The vision of the spirituality that comes from a work of God done in the heart is more and more obscured, and is supplanted by an esteeming of the work of men, thus substituting morality for spirituality. This is
<span class="scripture">&#8220;the abomination that maketh desolate.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Daniel+11%3A31" title="Daniel 11:31"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Daniel 11:31)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>In the book, <a href="../../../texts/A_True_Story_in_Allegory/index.html" title="A True Story in Allegory">A True Story in Allegory</a>, the author (who survived an apostasy) speaks of these conditions as a valley of morality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">(Now this aforementioned great camp had once been pitched on the top of a mountain, called Inspiration Mount. But of late years it had been gradually moved downward toward a valley called the valley of Morality. This was done not through any bad motive, but a man called Mr. Worldly-Wise had made it his business to inform some of the Shepherds that, if they would pitch the camp in a lower altitude, they would be able to bring in many who were too sickly or lame or lazy to climb the steep mountain, as it was ascended by a steep and narrow pathway which meant a laying aside of all luggage and much weariness to the flesh. So they, without consulting the King, had taken his advice, thinking that when they had got their new converts strengthened to a certain degree, they could get them to move upward.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; Mr. Circumspect continued, &#8220;I warned them many times, so did my Brother Discernment, but we were put down as old fogies, cranks, etc., so we submitted for the sake of unity. I also found that some whom you would least suspect, were troubled with an affliction of the eyes, and would not use
the King&#8217;s eye-salve (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+3%3A18">Revelation 3:18</a>),
but preferred moving down into the fogs, as the sun is always bright upon the mountain. I warned them that the Compromise family would come along and capture them sometime, but they said, &#8216;Impossible! impossible! How could we be so deceived after knowing so much of the truth!&#8217; But now, you see, no one can descend to this valley and be safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our safety is in loving God supremely, in being guided by His eye.</p>

<p>Once we were questioned by a young minister, very deeply loyal to his group, who asked us, speaking of those who received truth, &#8220;But, where are you leading them?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was evident in his mind, that there had to be a group for them to be led to. When we told him that we were simply leading them to Jesus (or, more accurately, pointing them to Jesus), he was not quite satisfied with the answer. He had a heritage of spiritual understanding that taught him that
we were complete in Him (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+2%3A10">Colossians 2:10</a>),
but he felt that <b>something more than Christ</b> was required. So he asked the question again, putting stress on the word <i>where</i>. And we answered him with the same answer, emphasizing the name of our Lord (how worthy He is; how completely adequate!). And then we asked him the question, &#8220;Where are <i>you</i> leading them?&#8221; He did not want to say it, as he felt that one of his masters was being slighted, but finally he reluctantly muttered, &#8220;Jesus.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">A zeal that springs from anything but pure, unmixed love for God and humanity, a spirit that would even promote holiness, or the conversion of sinners, partly to build up &#8220;our church,&#8221; is badly mixed, is soon shaken and cannot survive the Refiner&#8217;s fire.</p>

<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
<p>We are deeply interested in the practical application of this supreme-love-for-God-above-all desire in the soul.</p>

<p>We find that it does not seek to set up any artificial boundaries. What do you mean by that, some might ask? We gladly and happily recognize that God has laid down all necessary lines in His Word, and He is quite capable and willing to reveal them to the hearts of His trusting children. Therefore we require nothing of others beyond the Bible and will not accept less than just what the Bible requires. The Bible was written by God for His people, and it furnishes everything they need. It is perfectly adapted to the spiritual life He gives to them. This is not so in the many organizations of men, where it is necessary to manufacture a creed, written or not, which fits the life of that particular institution. They select and reject from the Word of God as seemeth good unto them, and they accept or reject members; but in His church, our heavenly Father takes care of who is in and who is out. Our names are written in heaven, and the government is upon His shoulder.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;If we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1%3A7" title="I&nbsp;John 1:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 1:7)</span></a></span>
After a while, in God&#8217;s time, it becomes evident who is following God and who is not; the Lord reveals what we need to know. The fruit manifests itself, and the will of the Lord is evident and understood by His trusting children.</p>

<p>A wonderful example of this is recorded in the book <a href="../../../texts/The_Man_of_His_Counsel/index.html" title="The Man of His Counsel">The Man of His Counsel</a>, which tells the dilemma of Brother Joe Holmeir. A great crisis came upon the little congregation where they were. Ministers of various persuasions split the people into groups, and children of God in that place did not know that this was wrong. Even a brother, who had been used of God to open Joe&#8217;s eyes to his need, joined one of these groups. But Joe could not:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Joe could not be persuaded to unite with them, for <b>he said he could not unite with one body, and therefore raise a barrier to exclude another in whom he had confidence and knew was a child of God as much as he.</b> As this faith believed and practiced close communion, Joe declined to give them his membership.</p>

<p>Alfred was very much surprised when Joe refused to unite with this body of people, and inquired of him his reason for not doing so. &#8220;I did not unite with them because I could not break the last tie between us,&#8221; replied Joe. &#8220;You know that I have confidence in you. I am sure that you are as much a child of God as I am, and I could not come around the Lord&#8217;s table and see you kept out. No, indeed; if there is ever a barrier raised between any other child of God and me, it will be one he raises.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what do you mean to do?&#8221; inquired Alfred. &#8220;You cannot go around all alone, can you? I should like to see you get settled somewhere where you can get in the harness just right and feel satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ask me what I mean to do,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;Well, I shall tell you. I mean to live by
<span class="scripture">&#8216;every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+4%3A4" title="Matthew 4:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 4:4)</span></a></span>
and be guided by it. As to working, I do not see how I could work more with any body of people than I am doing now. I am waiting on the Lord, and what He tells me to do, that will I do. Do you not think that I am on the safe track? And do you not think that I shall be satisfied when I do just what He tells me to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure that you will,&#8221; replied Alfred; &#8220;and as to a barrier between us, I am sure that I shall never raise one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have already raised it,&#8221; replied Joe quickly, &#8220;for I cannot speak with you in the organization to which you belong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that need not be a barrier between us,&#8221; hastily replied Alfred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not,&#8221; said Joe, &#8220;but somehow it seems to me there is not the freedom there that has been formerly. I feel that these organizations are dividing God&#8217;s children. You know we had wonderful times, and God met with us at the little community house when we were all together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be true,&#8221; replied Alfred, &#8220;but there are some things we shall never understand,&#8221; and he turned and walked slowly to the house. Joe had aroused something within his soul.</p>

<p>This indicated this man&#8217;s complete sincerity and honesty. He was not seduced by the various sectarian spirits which were separating God&#8217;s children at that time and place. Later, he found those who were free from a group loyalty spirit and completely led by the precious Spirit of Truth. In the book (which is based on actual events), the other brother (Alfred) was delivered from the spirit of loyalty to the group of which he was a member, and also took his stand for God and truth.</p>

<h2>Delivered from the Sectarian Spirit</h2>
<p>There is a great deal of difference between being delivered from a spirit of loyalty to a certain organization of men and simply switching loyalties from one group to another. There are many folks wandering about who are simply looking for a home. This is greatly different than coming to
<span class="scripture">&#8220;the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+3%3A15" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 3:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 3:15)</span></a></span>
It takes a depth of dying to self, of melting before the Lord, that simply cannot be done without the help of the Spirit of God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">The [denominational] minister had been holding meetings, with but little success. A Mrs. R&#8212;&#8212;, one of their number, had been praying the Lord to send somebody who would <b>preach the truth in such a way that God would get unto Himself a people who would serve Him.</b> She and a Mrs. W&#8212;&#8212; went to the altar together, with others. Brother Warner asked them whether they would be willing to separate themselves from denominationalism if the Lord should show them that duty. Sister W&#8212;&#8212; said in her heart, yes. Sister R&#8212;&#8212; turned over to her and said, &#8220;Now, they are trying to tear down the church, so let us just stick.&#8221; There she turned bitter, and the very thing she had prayed for, she was rejecting. She walked up and down the aisle wringing her hands and crying, &#8220;My church! My church!&#8221;</p>

<p>The story is told of a man who went to a public bench to pray during a meeting. A minister met him at the bench and asked him, &#8220;Do you need to be saved?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I am saved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you need to be sanctified and filled with the Holy Spirit?&#8221; the minister asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; the seeker replied. &#8220;The Lord has sanctified me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why are you here?&#8221; he was asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am here to consecrate out of sect Babylon,&#8221; the man answered.</p>

<p>That is what he sought and found.</p>

<p>Until we reach that depth of consecration and &#8220;Abba, Father,&#8221; within, we simply cannot
flow into the mountain of the Lord&#8217;s house (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+2%3A2">Isaiah 2:2</a>).
It is an uphill flow, contrary to the natural nature of man; but God is able to reduce us to where we are pliable in His hands. Incompatible natures, with naturally high rates of collision and friction, lose these characteristics under the anointing fire, and we are enabled to
<span class="scripture">&#8220;flow together&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+60%3A5" title="Isaiah 60:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 60:5)</span></a></span>
in the work of the Lord. Praise His name! It will take the politics out and put genuine bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering, and every other heavenly ingredient in&#8212;every needful thing for saints to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, right down here in this world.

The Spirit of God will steer a clear path between compromise and fanaticism enabling us to joyfully adhere to the balance that is in God.</p>

Instead of remaining identified with any sect, i.e., cut-off party, &#8220;directly or indirectly the result of sin,&#8221; you will claim membership in a fellowship with the &#8220;one and indivisible church that God has on earth, and that is made up of all the singular who are born of the Spirit.&#8221; On this broad and divinely-established platform, and here only, can you stand clear of the sin of sectarianism and the blood of immortal souls that perish through its pernicious influence.

<p>Salvation brings to the soul a wonderful liberty to do what is right.
A perfect liberty that comes from following the perfect law of liberty (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+1%3A25">James 1:25</a>).
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+3%3A17" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 3:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 3:17)</span></a></span>
The liberty to keep our conscience clear of offence toward God and man by the power of Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood. This liberty obligates us to obey God rather than man when there is conflict. It gives us freedom to be true to God, no matter what. A Christian may be thrown in jail, but if he keeps his integrity, he is still free. He is free to do what is right and not to do what is wrong. He is free to cross the opinions of men to please the Lord, regardless of what man can do unto him. Indeed, the spirit of perfect dependence upon Christ is the spirit of independence toward all men. Independent, that is, to obey the Lord. Our dearest friend should not be able to persuade us to deviate a hair&#8217;s breath from doing what we know the Lord to require of us. Many lose their liberty to serve God completely because their service is divided between His requirements and the requirements of the group to which they adhere.</p>

<p>We are at home among God&#8217;s people who walk in this way. Each of us understand the great need, the great necessity of walking in the light of truth. How blessed it is to dwell among a free people! A people set free by the power of the great Emancipator! With the confidence that our brethren are committed above all to keeping clear before God, how easy it is to extend longsuffering and forbearance, and to receive the same.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+133%3A1" title="Psalm 133:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 133:1)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>How it stirs our heart when we see those who are deeply convicted of the rightness or wrongness of some issue, but are under the influence of another spirit! Surely,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The fear of man bringeth a snare.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+29%3A25" title="Proverbs 29:25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 29:25)</span></a></span>
It is painful to see their struggles to please two masters! Oh, God has so much better for His children! Ye who sit with wounded conscience because you endeavored not to offend by doing what you know was right, the Lord has so much better for you. Do not be afraid to follow the way of God:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe.&#8221;</span>
</p>

<p>It is better to walk at peace with God though the whole world disapprove&#8212;though husband, wife, children, or parents disapprove. To always do what is right, to always please God, <b>this is worth more than anything</b>, both now and in the world to come. Will you settle this with the Lord? Will you not plead with Him to set you free to always do what is right, regardless of the cost? Will you not die to all but Jesus and His will forevermore? Does He not have a valid claim to be first in your affection? Did He not suffer without the gate that you might serve Him and crown Him above all else in your heart?</p>

<p>

<h2>Characteristics of the True Church</h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The true church of God, comprising all Christians, has in her normal state under her divine head certain essential characteristics which make her exclusively the church, the whole and not a part. These might be expressed as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Possession of divine spiritual life.</b> If the church does not possess this she is not Christ&#8217;s body and therefore not the church. She must know the Spirit of God.</li>

<li><b>Disposition to obey all Scripture and to let the Spirit have His way and rule.</b> This constitutes her safety in matters of doctrine and government.</li>

<li><b>An attitude receptive to any further truth and light.</b> This safeguards against dogmatism and a spirit of infallibility and intolerance, against interpreting Christianity in the light of traditions and old ideas.</li>

<li><b>Acknowledgment of good wherever found and the placing of no barrier that would exclude any who might be Christians.</b> This makes <b>salvation, a holy life, and a Christian spirit</b> the only test of fellowship, and <b>disapproves all human standards of church membership and fellowship.</b></li>

</ol>
<p>We repeat that these constitute the Scriptural standard of the church and characterize her in her unity and integrity. It is by lacking in one or more of these essentials that a sect is a sect.</p>

<h1>A More Sure Word of Prophecy</h1>

<p>In Brother Peter&#8217;s second epistle, he states some precious truths about God&#8217;s power and promises, and then begins the line of thought that we wish to develop here.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath showed me. Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance. For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty. For He received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to Him from the excellent glory, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with Him in the holy mount. We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+1%3A14-21" title="II&nbsp;Peter 1:14-21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 1:14-21)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;To have these things always in remembrance.&#8221;</span>
Let us consider this in a historical perspective. We see the Lord in the garden giving a command to Adam and Eve, a command that they were supposed to keep always in remembrance. Satan succeeded in driving it out of their remembrance with lies. Although men later began to call on the name of the Lord, so few kept God&#8217;s truth in remembrance that only eight were saved from the Flood. We can continue through Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and see some getting it better than others. We see among the brothers of Joseph different degrees of remembrance. We see this problem with remembrance when the children of Israel went into the promised land under Joshua&#8217;s leadership.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The people served the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Judges+2%3A7" title="Judges 2:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Judges 2:7)</span></a></span>
But then they turned away to idols. We see this in the lives of the kings of Judah. As often as not, the son of a godly king would turn to idols, and forget the living God. Sometimes even a king who started out for the Lord would turn away toward the end of his life. So remembrance has been a real problem in history.</p>

<p>Here, Brother Peter faces this issue as he is coming near the end of his course. He knows these things are true.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath showed me. Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.&#8221;</span>
And why is it so important for Brother Peter? Is it because he&#8217;s persuaded that there is some good moral content in them, like some of Aesop&#8217;s fables or Grimm&#8217;s fairy tales? No,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.&#8221;</span>
He was there! He was an eyewitness! He heard the words. He saw the miracles. He was on the mount of transfiguration!
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. And this voice which came from heaven we heard.&#8221;</span>
Peter, and James, and John heard! Perhaps you are inclined to think, &#8220;If only I had been there, and a part of that. Then I could be sure, like Peter!&#8221; But he says further,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;We have also a more sure word of prophecy.&#8221;</span>
There&#8217;s something more reliable than being eyewitnesses. There&#8217;s something more certain, there&#8217;s something higher, than personal experience. There&#8217;s something more valid, more dependable, more sound. This is a person who walked with Jesus on this earth for three and a half years. This is a person who witnessed His glory on that mountain. And he is saying,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts.&#8221;</span>
</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s develop this thought: we have a more sure word of prophecy, we have the Word of God written down, inspired, but how do we go about assimilating it? How do we go about getting the good out of it?
<span class="scripture">&#8220;That ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts.&#8221;</span>
Think a moment about being out in a dark place at night. Maybe your job is to watch, to guard until morning. You make do with what you&#8217;ve got. If you have a campfire there, then that&#8217;s your light. You focus on it, you see from its light, you keep it burning as you wait for the dawn. And when dawn comes, and the sun rises, it fills up the whole earth with light, so there isn&#8217;t any darkness left.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Until&#8230;&#8203;the daystar arise in your hearts.&#8221;</span>
When you need to know what&#8217;s true, or what the Lord wants you to do, or how to proceed amidst many opinions and teachings and choices, ask, &#8220;What is your teaching about this, Lord? What is the truth on this matter? There are so many different opinions, people say this, and other people say that.&#8221;
<span class="scripture">&#8220;That ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts.&#8221;</span>
Draw near to God. Don&#8217;t be content with a surface look at the scriptures, but ask Him to teach you, and keep asking Him to teach you, until you&#8217;re taught! Ask Him what He wants of you in this area until you&#8217;re illuminated&#8212;not just a glimpse, not just a little light, but until it fills your heart. Until it&#8217;s clear, like the daylight.</p>

<p>And then, to help us go further:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.&#8221;</span>
This is a first principle of understanding. Not, &#8220;How does this fit in my way of thinking?&#8221;; &#8220;I think this must be the right meaning, because it appeals to me&#8221;; &#8220;Someone I highly respect believes this&#8221;; or, &#8220;That&#8217;s the way I think things ought to be.&#8221; No:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.&#8221;</span>
We&#8217;ve got to go to the Author&#8212;the Author was not man, the men were just taking down notes, as it were. They were just the scribes. They were moved by the Holy Ghost. If you would understand this
<span class="scripture">&#8220;more sure word of prophecy,&#8221;</span>
if you would have a clear way of getting to that point where it illuminates your heart, you must appeal to the Holy Ghost. You must have the Holy Ghost abiding with you. If you don&#8217;t have a new heart and a walk with the Author of the Bible, you can&#8217;t get that illumination&#8212;a clear understanding of the scriptures. And you have to not only know the Author, but look to Him and depend on Him to teach you. Not my will, but His will be done. Not the way I like to think, but the way it really is. Not the way that&#8217;s going to be easier for me, but the way that&#8217;s true. I don&#8217;t want a private interpretation, I want the Lord&#8217;s interpretation.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts.&#8221;</span>
</p>

<p>What a precious thing it is to be able to be taught by God. How do you know this is God&#8217;s standard about this, or that? How do you know God requires this? How do you know God wants you to do that? How do you know this is really right, and this is really wrong? Because the Lord is willing to teach us. Because He has given us a sure word of prophecy. As Jesus said to Thomas,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+20%3A29" title="John 20:29"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 20:29)</span></a></span>
Why blessed? Well, one aspect is this: they&#8217;re depending on a more sure word of prophecy. Let&#8217;s discuss a little the shortcomings of &#8220;eyewitness&#8221; learning.</p>

<p>My senses can fool me. I can be fooled by my eyesight. Our minds fill in a lot of gaps in our eyesight. One morning I was walking by a bedroom, and I glanced in and thought my youngest daughter was in the bed. I wanted to talk to her, so I went in. She wasn&#8217;t in the bed&#8212;it was just her covers rolled up. Your mind often supplies things based on sketchy information.</p>

<p>I can be fooled by my hearing. Sometimes I hear a few words and my mind supplies the rest, and I&#8217;m persuaded someone said something they never said. I picked it out of context, or I heard part of it and my imagination did the rest.</p>

<p>I can be fooled by my taste buds. When I was about 20 years old, I was working long hours in a cannery, and would come home and eat after everyone else had finished. One time, a chicken salad had been prepared for me. Now I didn&#8217;t like mayonnaise, and everyone knew it, so I figured they wouldn&#8217;t put any mayonnaise in a chicken salad they had prepared for me. I just ate it, assuming no mayonnaise was in it. There was something a little different than usual about it, but it still tasted pretty good, and I said so. Then I was told that there was mayonnaise in it. You see, my taste buds were influenced some by my own preconceptions. If they&#8217;d told me before I&#8217;d eaten it that there was mayonnaise in it, it would have tasted worse to me.</p>

<p>Sometimes I can even be fooled by my sense of touch. If I touch something extremely cold, it feels like it burns.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;A more sure word of prophecy.&#8221;</span>
We don&#8217;t have to depend on private interpretation. We don&#8217;t have to depend on our own experience. Our experience has some value, but we have a more sure word of prophecy. We have a foundation to lean on. The Word of God illuminated in our hearts by the Spirit of God. It&#8217;s a foundation all our experiences ought to be built on. There&#8217;s no mirages in the Word of God. Interpreted by the Author, the Word of God and the Spirit of God, it is the foundation of truth in our lives. Oh,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;to have these things always in remembrance.&#8221;</span>
</p>

<p>Brother Peter has gone on. It wasn&#8217;t too long after he wrote this that he went on. But you know, a lot of people have gotten a hold of God&#8217;s precious truth and remembered it since then, who weren&#8217;t eyewitnesses. They had a more sure word of prophecy, and we have it available to us, too. Thank the Lord.</p>

<blockquote><p class="first">From <i>Two Hundred Instances of Divine Healing</i></p>
</blockquote>


<h1>Healing of Willie and Forrest</h1>

<p class="author">A. A. Robinson</p>

<p>In the year 1906, our little Willie, then two-and-a-half years old, had a long, sharpened, lead pencil in his hand, and in running across the floor, fell, and ran the sharpened end of the pencil just between his right eyeball and the frontal bone&#8212;in fact, it ran up into the frontal bone and broke off. His mother hastened to him as he started to rise, but the piece had come so near to the brain that he fell, apparently lifeless, into her arms. She carried him into the dining room, where I met her and took him. We saw only a small wound above his eye, which was closed so nicely that it looked as if it might be only a pin-scratch. We found the broken pencil near where he fell, and eagerly, though vainly, we searched the room for the piece broken off, which was no small thing to be in one&#8217;s eye.</p>

<p>Before this he had revived, and I suggested that we pray before doing anything else. God has promised to be a present help in time of need, and we believed His word. After prayer, we considered having a physician remove the pieces, but, knowing the injury to be so very near to the brain, we feared lest the probing might prove fatal. We called Brother S. P. McCully, who came and prayed with us, and said he felt a real assurance that God would make it all right without the aid of a physician. We then felt very much encouraged and decided to trust it all with God.</p>

<p>In two days his eye was swollen tight shut, and it remained so for nearly a week, when he ran against the corner of the kitchen cabinet and broke the injured place open. But it was well festered and ready to come open, and tiny splinters and specks of lead came out with the corruption. We used every precaution by sanitation to prevent blood-poisoning. The enemy whispered that the muscle was severed which holds the eyelid up, and that the lid would now always droop. We did not believe it, for we trusted in God with all our hearts, and He assured us that He would perform that which He had spoken. The wound kept running, and larger splinters and pieces of lead came out. In about two weeks it got well and healed up nicely, but, lo! the lid drooped. We were not dismayed, but kept our faith in God and reminded Him of His promise. Soon the place swelled and festered again; and when it opened, a piece of wood larger than a grain of wheat came out and later two pieces of lead, one of which was more than an eighth of an inch in length. Then it healed nicely, leaving the lid exactly like the other and leaving only a very small scar. Does it pay to trust in God? We decided with all our hearts that it does.</p>

<p>Again, in the spring of the year 1907, our little Forrest, then one year old, in learning to walk, fell many times. There was a certain kind of grass (peculiar to that part of the State&#8212;Eureka, Kansas) growing in our yard. One of the little bearded heads ran up the baby&#8217;s right nostril, or he might have put it there. We didn&#8217;t know it, and the beards were pointing downward, which hindered them from working out. Soon it caused a sore to come in his nose, and for months the odor was so very offensive that we could not enjoy our baby boy very much. In the fall of that same year we saw Brother S. G. Bryant and asked him what he thought was wrong. He said that, as near as he was able to judge, it was chronic catarrh. We were much troubled about the affliction, as we could scarcely bear to sleep near the child on account of the offensive odor.</p>

<p>One afternoon, in December of that year, as Wife was rocking him to sleep, the thought came forcibly to her mind (as if whispered by the angels of heaven, she said), &#8220;Jesus is able to heal him.&#8221; Her heart was melted before the Lord as she thought of His tender mercy. In tears of gratitude she offered a simple little prayer of faith, not including more than a dozen words, and as she walked to the bed with the sleeping child, she said, &#8220;Lord, I believe Thou wilt do this for Thy glory.&#8221; She never thought of it again until Forrest awoke, and, as he went running across the room, she noticed some small object protruding from his right nostril. In removing it she found it to be a head of the grass from our yard. In less than two days the bad odor was gone, and that was the last trace of the affliction.</p>

<p>Dear reader, it pays to trust in God.</p>

<h1>We Trusted in God: Part 4</h1>

<p>Physical intimacy is only honorable and lawful after a couple has taken vows of consecration to each other before God and man. By putting first the spiritual in the relationship between a man and woman who are approaching marriage, we find a special blessing.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+6%3A33" title="Matthew 6:33"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 6:33)</span></a></span>
We never kissed until the day we were married. We were careful. We wanted to kiss.
A strong physical attraction was present between us, but it was held in subjection until the time (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+9%3A27">I&nbsp;Corinthians 9:27</a>).
</p>

<p>Following the example of other spiritual couples, we went to gospel services together. We discussed what was preached and shared our impressions. One night, I was taking her home from a service, where we had just heard a message on children. The preacher had advocated that a couple should have as many as they could. He said this was pleasing to the Lord. Trying to avoid this was displeasing, he stated. He and his wife were living to what he preached. Elois asked me how I felt. I did not know what to say. I looked to God in my heart. Finally, I told her that I would never want to do anything that would hurt her or injure her health. This answer seemed to suffice for the time. Although I had not considered this particular subject carefully, I felt certain that the Lord would not want us to do anything that would be detrimental, either. (The subject of how many children a couple should have deserves more extensive treatment than is possible to cover here in this article.)</p>

<p>The ability to discuss and deal with difficult, knotty decisions is so important to life together. A man and a woman will look at things differently. Will this cause you to disagree, or will you be able to bring together your different viewpoints to produce a consensus? Will the head of the family use his authority to crush and override the wife, or will he
<span class="scripture">&#8220;dwell with [her] according to knowledge&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A7" title="I&nbsp;Peter 3:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 3:7)</span></a></span>?
Will you, by the help of the Lord, forge a team of two to face life&#8217;s problems?</p>

<p>Now, twenty years have passed. We have two children, both daughters. A third little one was taken in a miscarriage. I have felt that we have had only these offspring to give us time and energy to devote to the children of others. What was the value of the conversation then? It was one of the first highly significant mutual problem-solving discussions that we had. It was the beginning of a pattern in our marriage. My companion was determined to submit herself to her husband, as the Lord requires. I was determined to dwell with her according to knowledge, as the Lord requires. There is a way to do both and get the blessing that God has prepared.</p>

<p>There was a lot of talk and gossip. There always is. It would be better if there wasn&#8217;t, but it always seems to be with us. A certain individual did not like it that Elois was going with someone who had recently been backslidden. This person made it their business to inform Elois of the &#8220;mistake&#8221; she was making. When Elois and I saw each other again, I could tell that she had something on her mind. She was not certain whether to tell me or not, as she did not want to pass on something that would be a discouragement to me. I leaned back in the car behind the steering wheel, and I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be listening to you all the rest of our lives, so just tell me all about it.&#8221; So the whole tale tumbled out, including the answer that the Lord had given her when she prayed about it. He had shown her not to fear
the rumour that shall be heard in the land (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+51%3A46">Jeremiah 51:46</a>).
I had long ago consecrated to simply live down any talk, truthful or not. What I saw in this, however, was that God Himself was dealing with my future companion and preparing her for us to go on together.</p>

<p>Really communicating is the life-blood of a marriage. Talking is not necessarily <i>communicating</i>. It is amazing how difficult it is to really impart what I mean and to really understand what you mean. Especially if you happen to be the opposite gender. One of the basic skills of a good marriage is this two-way discussing. It is an ability well worth developing; indeed, it is essential. We get an idea of its potential in its even more inspiring synonym, <i>communion</i>. A husband and wife who develop the ability to <i>commune</i> together.</p>

<p>Male and female do not communicate the same way. Observe the way women talk with women and men with men. To really talk with your wife will exercise you spiritually; to really talk with your husband will do the same.</p>

<p>Typically, the woman realizes the importance of communication more readily than the man. Her natural orientation toward motherhood, etc., seem to focus attention earlier on this vital need. The natural attitude of men is to downplay this &#8220;touchy, feely&#8221; stuff; they esteem the doing rather than the talking. If a man is saved and living for God, his walk with the Lord helps him here. He learns the importance of <b>talking, communicating, communing</b> with God. It prepares him for his journey through life with his wife. How wonderful are the ways of the Lord!
<span class="scripture">&#8220;According as his divine power hath given unto us <b>all things that pertain</b> unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+1%3A3" title="II&nbsp;Peter 1:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 1:3)</span></a></span>
Note that this scripture was inspired through a married brother.</p>

<p>Although talking with a woman may not come as naturally or as easily to a man as a wife may wish, I can assure you that the Lord can make it very rewarding. I have a very great respect for my wife&#8217;s thinking processes. She is just as intuitive in her cognitions as most women are and most men are not, and I have learned to value her insights and contributions a great deal. I appreciate the privilege of bringing both masculine and feminine thinking to bear on the problems with which we must deal. Of praying together. Of battling together against our spiritual foes. One may chase a thousand, but two can put ten thousand to flight. Yea,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ecclesiastes+4%3A9" title="Ecclesiastes 4:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ecclesiastes 4:9)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>We began to plan our wedding. We wanted it to be simple and plain, not ornate or fancy. We believed that God wanted us to live simple and plain lives, dressing plainly in such a manner as adorns the gospel, rather than ourselves. Why should it be any different on our wedding day? Most of all, we wanted God to be magnified. We hoped that others might be stirred to follow the way of Divine guidance instead of other ways.</p>

<p>We admired the customs of old. A sister and brother would arise from their seats at a regular gospel service, be married by a minister before the congregation, sit back down as man and wife, and remain for the rest of the service. But we were counseled to set a time apart from a general service to allow attendance by many others in other congregations who knew us, loved us, and wanted to be there. Some of them came from quite a distance. We were married in the chapel at Enid, Oklahoma, that Elois&#8217; father had helped construct. The reception for all the guests followed in the dining hall of the chapel. Elois&#8217; mother felt inadequate to prepare for such a number of guests, so a relative of their family catered the occasion. We asked two quartets to sing spiritual songs, as we loved music. It was too much. We began to have misgivings. We found out that the pastor and his wife who had prayed us together were not planning to attend the ceremony. Other spiritual members of the congregation were not planning to attend, either. They had stopped attending weddings because they had gotten too fancy. We were doing everything we knew to avoid a fancy wedding, and this was the first I had heard of their convictions along this line. We seriously considered canceling the entire thing and getting married at the home of Elois&#8217; folks with only immediate family in attendance. But it seemed to be too late to change plans.</p>

<p>It is one of my regrets that I did not learn about these spiritual brethren&#8217;s stand until the plans for my wedding were already in place. We did the best that we knew and walked in all the light that we had. If we had it to do over again, I think I would rather err on the side of too much simplicity and humbleness and less on the side of too much ado.
There is something about human nature that tends to stress the importance of things through elaborate ceremony, but God does not work that way (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Samuel+16%3A7">I&nbsp;Samuel 16:7</a>).
</p>

<p>I do feel that we avoided many things in our wedding, thereby bringing a great blessing to us. We certainly did not enter into a spirit of emulations toward other weddings. That is just wrong. We wanted each part to be spiritually meaningful in such a way that it would bring a blessing to others who loved the Lord and a reproof to those who did not.</p>

<p>The unspiritual young people had an abominable practice of covering the vehicle of the newly-married couple with shaving cream with which were inscribed silly and shallow sayings. Sometimes pebbles were put in the hubcaps and tin cans were dangled from strings tied to the lower regions of the automobile to make noise. The inside of the car would be filled with balloons. Then they would chase the departing couple, honking horns and generally engaging in riotous revelry. It was an ungodly and dangerous practice. They especially liked to do their worst on preachers.</p>

<p>We prayed that the Lord would help us escape this custom. Two cars were messed up, but we left in a third. We slipped out of the building and drove away before the chase could get organized. It was necessary to rent a car and park it early that morning, long before the wedding. And we met earlier in the week to hide another car with our luggage. But we were not chased. We had prayed earnestly that the Lord would help us with that.</p>

<p>Behind the warmth and gloriousness, beyond the exhilaration and coddling, behind the fond expressions and attentiveness, are the things that make or break a marriage. All of these wonderful things are fastened to the walls, the foundations, the ground upon which the marriage is built, but are not the substance. A shack that is decorated like a mansion is still a shack. A mansion that is neglected is still a mansion.</p>

<p>The story is told of a certain brother who sat down with his wife on their first night together and asked her, &#8220;Do you want to get a divorce?&#8221; She was at the height of her newly-married joy and happiness and replied in astonishment that she did not. Whereupon he told her that he did not either, and never wanted to come to that, and stated that he was confident that if they would agree to faithfully follow certain courses of behavior, that they never would. So they covenanted to never go to bed angry with each other, among other things.</p>

<p>If all would do as they did, people would be much happier, and there would be many less broken homes.</p>

<p>The foundation and load-bearing characteristics of a marriage are, to a great extent, laid before the two embark on their voyage as man and wife. It is very difficult to remodel or rebuild your marriage after you have moved in, so to speak. Sometimes it is necessary, even then (and it is certainly better than failing), but I would say without hesitation that it is harder and more difficult.</p>

<p>The weight of everything else that you build in your life will press down on your marriage along with the storms, the earthquakes, the floods that come your way. If your testimony is indeed like this:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock,&#8221;</span>
then your after-testimony can be like this:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+6%3A48" title="Luke 6:48"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 6:48)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>God has designed marriage to satisfy a man with a man&#8217;s needs and a woman with a woman&#8217;s needs. Sad indeed, when things become skewed and one is neglected! That is, when policy is followed instead of the wisdom that cometh down from above. The plan of God is
<span class="scripture">&#8220;first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+3%3A17" title="James 3:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 3:17)</span></a></span>
If husband and wife will get this experience from God in their hearts and practice it on each other, it will produce the fruit of righteousness, which is sown in peace of them that make peace. They will benefit; their children will benefit; all around them will be effected in a good way. The world is a little better place for each righteous couple; it is a little worse for each couple that has not put away iniquity.</p>

<h1>Book Reviews</h1>

<p>The only safe criteria to use in evaluating a book is to carefully monitor the fruit that comes from the reading.</p>

<p>One individual may get a lot of good out of the same material that works evil to another. It depends on how it is taken.</p>

<p>We have a burden to make others aware of our experiences with different books. If you try some of this reading and do not find it a profitable experience, lay it aside. Perhaps it is not for you at all, or not for you at this time. Ask the Lord to guide you.</p>

<h2><a href="../../../texts/The_Hidden_Life/index.html" title="The Hidden Life">The Hidden Life</a></h2>
<p class="author">Charles E. Orr</p>

<p>Of all the books by C. E. Orr, this one has meant the most to me. In my early teens, during a period of illness, I was deeply impressed with the chapter on humility. It changed the pattern of my life.</p>

<p>Brother Orr&#8217;s burden is for deeper living, walking more closely with God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">This well of water in the soul is a well of living water; it is a well springing up into everlasting life. It is fittingly represented by an artesian well, which needs no surface pump&#8230;.</p>

<p>The force that produces the outward flow from an artesian well is down in the depths below. It is the pressure of the inward flow. Open the check-valve at any time and the water flows. The force that produces the inward flow of the water of life in the Christian heart is the exercise of the soul in prayer. The more the soul is thus exercised the stronger is the inward pressure. Without the soul&#8217;s being exercised in converse with God; without its being deeply concerned about the affairs of eternity; without examination of the heart: or without secret reading, meditation, inquiries, and seekings&#8212;the inward flow from God will not be maintained.</p>

<p>The outward flow is necessary. The pressure of the inward flow raises the water so high, and if there is no outward flow, the inward flow ceases, and all will become stagnant.</p>

<p>Over the years, this writing has come to mean more and more to me. Highly recommended.</p>

<h2>Ben Hur</h2>
<p class="author">Lew Wallace</p>

<p>Edited and abridged by James S. Bell, Jr.; published by Moody Press, 1993</p>

<p>This abridged version is much more readable than the original. We understand that Lew Wallace, a Civil war general, was an unbeliever, who began this book with the intention of proving that there was nothing to the story of Jesus. According to what we have been told, he was convinced, as he gathered material for this book, that the Biblical account is true, and he wrote this book from the standpoint of proving that the story of Jesus, as revealed in the scriptures, is true.</p>

<p>Ben Hur was a son of one of the princes of Judea during the Roman occupation at the time of the Christ. As a very young man, he was accused of treason and sent to the galleys for life. His mother and sister disappeared. The subsequent narrative details his desire for revenge, his preparations for the same, his temptations, and most significantly, his encounters with the Messiah.</p>

<p>The author has imagined a fascinating tale, which is woven with some truth. There are some things that I do not care for in the writing. A large portion of the book deals with Ben Hur&#8217;s attempts to get revenge, his hatreds, and carnality. Still, it is an accurate picture of how many a person lives. It is informative of the times and may help you to be able to project what it was like back in the days when Jesus walked the earth in bodily form. Lew Wallace has probably given us his best vision of what it means (and has meant) to meet the Master. Salvation, however, goes further, much further, in the life than was found by the son of Hur. Even after he &#8220;settled&#8221; down, he still seems to come short of the salvation experience taught and practiced in the New Testament.</p>

<p>There is enough merit in the book that we feel we can recommend it with some caution. It may not be for you. We strongly suggest that you pray about it and wait on God to see if you can read it unto edification.</p>

<h2>Arena, The Story of the Colosseum</h2>
<p class="author">John Pearson</p>

<p>Published by McGraw-Hill, 1973</p>

<p>This very interesting and readable book delves into the effect that the arena had on the Roman citizenry, comparing the circuses and gladiator shows to the effects of television today on the populace. The gladiators were celebrities as sports figures are today. It also mentions the reaction of the early Christian church (up to approximately 270 A.D.) to this popular abomination. They were afraid of its effect on human nature. &#8220;As Augustine knew, the arena was a danger to the church, but not primarily as a source of persecution. The real threat came from its infection&#8221; (pp. 166). &#8220;A Christian was taken by friends to the amphitheatre, very much against his will. The spectacle, the violence, the bloodshed&#8212;they seduced him&#8221; (pp. 16-17). Different emperors realized the degenerate effect of the games and tried to abolish or diminish them, but to no avail. The overall tone of this book, while informative, is grim and sad. What an awful waste, both of participators and spectators!

<h1>A Craft Section for Young Men</h1>

<p>We are planning to start a column with useful craft projects for young men, and would appreciate submissions from our readers. Just how did you make that drawer organizer for your Mom&#8217;s sewing drawer? Or how did you make that table? Or what practical designs can you offer for a rabbit hutch? Or&#8230;&#8203;?</p>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t have to be limited to woodwork projects. Any first experiences with changing the oil on a vehicle? Fixing a leaky faucet?</p>

<p>We will consider anything that seems profitable toward encouraging other young men to develop those handy skills to help around home.</p>

<h1>A Page for Boys</h1>

<h2>Ages 10-13</h2>
<p>We know that you might not be a 10- to 13-year-old boy, because we have noticed that many of them will not read anything addressed to themselves. But we will try anyway. Oh, we forgot to tell you what we will try. We thought we&#8217;d call it an association. You&#8217;re probably wondering what &#8220;It&#8221; is. Well, we haven&#8217;t gotten the title yet&#8212;we&#8217;re counting on you for that.</p>

<p>The purpose of this association is to
provoke each other unto love and good works like the Bible teaches (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A24">Hebrews 10:24</a>).
Jesus is our Example of how to live pleasing to God, but He must first be our Savior and Lord. We are glad if you are on the way to Heaven, but if you&#8217;re not, we&#8217;ll pray for you. When you live for God, you will find that it is the most exciting adventure a boy could ever have. And this is the adventure we&#8217;re going to talk about in this group, including Bible quizzes, questions, riddles, and other things to think about and do.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re going to try to make this column interesting to you (that is, the people who this is addressed to), so we will welcome any suggestions you might have. In fact, we&#8217;re hoping you will answer some questions that we&#8217;ve written below.</p>

<ul>
<li>What shall our motto be? Part of our purpose is to be like the Good Samaritan (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+10%3A33">Luke 10:33</a>). This includes learning to sacrifice ourselves to help others in need. We will mention a book shortly which tells of a group of boys that formed this kind of club. Look in the Bible for good mottos.</li>

<li>We need a title. Should this be called an association? A squad? A club?</li>

<li>Do you have any particular topics that you want to discuss? Anything else?</li>

</ul>
<p>Now, we&#8217;re expecting to hear from you. If we don&#8217;t, this page may not be interesting. Write to via <a class="www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/contact/?to=ft">email</a> or our mailing address.</p>

<p>The following is an excerpt from a book, <i>The Midnight Test</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Mark suddenly decided not to eat his apple. He wasn&#8217;t hungry anyhow. What did Andy want with him? Closing his lunch pail and putting it away, Mark hurried outside.</p>

<p>Andy was waiting for him. &#8220;The Shetler boys told me about you wanting to join.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then it was about the test. Mark held his breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re willing to give you a try, and if you pass the test, all right. We haven&#8217;t decided what the test is to be yet, but as soon as we do, we&#8217;ll let you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When are you going to decide?&#8221; Mark asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as we get a chance to talk with Mervin and Titus. That may be tonight, I&#8217;m not sure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; Andy said. &#8220;I nearly forgot. You must have your father&#8217;s permission to join.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ohhh,&#8221; Mark groaned. He hated the job to ask.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one of our rules,&#8221; Andy said firmly. &#8220;If you can&#8217;t get permission, then we won&#8217;t even let you try the test.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll ask him.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Consider: The Bird in the Window</h2>
<p>Bang! It was a little black-capped chickadee whose happy whistles we had often heard around the house, but today it was acting very strange. Bang! There it was again, fluttering against our kitchen window pane and pecking at the glass. Did it not see the window? Did it see something inside that it wanted? We couldn&#8217;t figure the little bird out.</p>

<p>All morning the sharp whistles and pecks of the chickadee could be heard, first at the kitchen windows, then at the living room ones. Bang! Scrape-bang! At lunch we decided to experiment. We slid open the kitchen window and took out the screen. Maybe it was looking for a place to make a nest and saw something inviting inside. The bird flew away at the disturbance, but soon returned. Cautiously it landed on the window frame and pecked at the glass. But the bird ignored the open window.</p>

<p>At last we realized what was causing the bird&#8217;s strange behavior. Can you guess? The chickadee was fighting its own reflection in our windows! Not twenty feet from our kitchen window was a nesting box to which the chickadee and his mate had recently taken a fancy. Now the zealous little bird was ready to defend his territory from any enemy&#8212;and the chickadee he saw in our windows was a threat to his peace and happiness. The poor little bird couldn&#8217;t understand that this wasn&#8217;t a real enemy at all.</p>

<p>We might laugh at this chickadee&#8217;s foolishness, but take a moment to consider ourselves. Do we get defensive about little things that really don&#8217;t matter? Do we fight something that is just a &#8220;reflection in the window&#8221;? How about learning a lesson from this little bird? When Mom tells us to do something when we&#8217;re having fun, instead of grumbling about it (which only makes the work harder and less fun), let&#8217;s jump up and do it cheerfully. Instead of fussing about what we don&#8217;t have, we can be thankful for all that we do enjoy. When others say something that is mean or tease us, does it help to &#8220;peck&#8221; them back? No, not at all. The Bible says <span class="scripture">&#8220;A soft answer turneth away wrath,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+15%3A1" title="Proverbs 15:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 15:1)</span></a></span> and you&#8217;ll find it is true if you try it out. What else makes us defensive and &#8220;pecky&#8221; like that little bird?</p>

<p>Think about it. We can waste a great amount of time just making life hard for everyone. When Jesus lived on the earth, He spent His time making life better. There are lots of people who need love and kindness shown to them, and some of them are in your own home. We should pray for the Lord&#8217;s help to live like He did. Jesus has promised to help us if we will follow Him and obey the Bible. So, let&#8217;s stop fighting &#8220;the bird in the window&#8221; and get down to the real business of being like Jesus.</p>

<h1>&#8220;I Write Unto You, Young Men&#8221;</h1>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first"><span class="scripture">&#8220;I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+2%3A14" title="I&nbsp;John 2:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 2:14)</span></a></span></p>
</div>


<p>Young Men,</p>

<p>We wrote earlier that we hoped to lay before you some thoughts on meditating on the scriptures. It seemed good to meditate with you on the above scripture, both to benefit from the scripture and to demonstrate the process, rather than attempt to explain meditating in a theoretical sense.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I have written unto you, young men&#8221;</span>&#8212;have you considered all that lies behind these words? John, the beloved disciple, after a long life of living for his Master, of knowing Him better and better, with all the insights, blessings, and wisdom the Lord had imparted to Him, had much worth passing on. He was stirred by the love of God to endeavor to communicate something to those men starting out, those still early on the way. He had been young and had first loved Jesus as a young man. In this world, how often the older men are inclined to say or think, &#8220;Let the young men learn the hard way, like I did.&#8221; How different the love of God makes us. Do you not see the love of God flowing through John as he seeks to impart something to help the young men on the way? Do you not see the love of God in preserving this letter in His holy Word to benefit you today? The Lord is very interested in you, young men. He loves you. He inspired John to write these words then, and for now, also.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Because ye are strong&#8221;</span>&#8212;consider this word of encouragement and exhortation. We tend to think that the weak need help, and we must consider ourselves weak. Yet he says, &#8220;because ye are strong.&#8221; God is able to make us strong. Each time we trust in God, each time we turn to Him for grace and get the victory in our trials, we are strong. Young men are at their strongest time of life, physically. But unless that strength is used, it is soon lost. Unless that strength is used, it is only potential, and has not been proven or demonstrated. We see the young man lift the cumbersome load, perform the arduous task, toss the heavy bale of hay, and we think that he is strong. Likewise, the Lord supplies all the grace we need to defeat the enemy of our soul, if we but use what He supplies us. Not strong in physical strength, nor in our own strength, but strong in battle with the strength the Lord freely supplies. A hunter who is going after large game is not physically able to master the bear, or elk, or moose, but when he uses his gun, as it is designed to be used, he is strong and well able to overcome his adversary. So Brother John exhorts you:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;because ye are strong.&#8221;</span>
The Lord has supplied weapons to you with which you are strong, if you use them. Use your spiritual weapons, and remember that, with them, you are strong.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And the word of God abideth in you&#8221;</span>&#8212;this was true of those to whom John wrote. Is it true of you? If not, it can and ought to be! To abide is to remain or continue in the same place or condition. When the Word of God is abiding in you, you have learned it, absorbed it, obeyed it, applied it&#8212;it is &#8220;at home&#8221; with you. You don&#8217;t keep it at arms length, or rejoice a moment in it and then send it on its way&#8212;it stays with you. By the mercy and grace of God, I can say that His Word abides in me, but I can also say that there is much more of His Word that I need to and want to let abide in me. Thank the Lord, I can keep growing in this abiding. You can keep growing in this abiding. Is the Lord dealing with you in some area of your life? Is His Word looking for an abiding place in you? Ask the Lord to bring His Word in this matter to a place where you understand it, and obey it, and it abides in you. There are many precious promises to those with whom the Lord abides, and His Word abides.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And ye have overcome the wicked one&#8221;</span>&#8212;to overcome is to conquer, vanquish or subdue. Surely it is a wondrous thing, for those who were once captives of &#8220;the wicked one,&#8221; and slaves to sin, to not only escape the foe&#8217;s prison, but to be able to meet him on the battlefield with continual success! How is it possible? How could there be any young men of this class, to whom John was writing? How can you and I be of this class?
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+15%3A57" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 15:57"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 15:57)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of His knowledge by us in every place.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+2%3A14" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 2:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 2:14)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God: Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints; And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel, For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+6%3A10-20" title="Ephesians 6:10-20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 6:10-20)</span></a></span>
In the Lord all things are possible. Notice the adverbs and adjectives abounding in these scriptures: &#8220;always,&#8221; &#8220;every,&#8221; &#8220;whole,&#8221; &#8220;all.&#8221; The Lord has overcome the evil one and always does. If we abide in Him, we cannot be defeated,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;because greater is He that is in you, than he that is in the world.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+4%3A4" title="I&nbsp;John 4:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 4:4)</span></a></span>
Do you not see that both the standard of victory and the promises go together?</p>

<p>And so I have written also to you, young men. If you &#8220;chew&#8221; on the scriptures, if you ask the Lord to inspire your meditation and examine the word from every angle&#8212;from the context, from related scriptures&#8212;and grab hold until they have driven out the things of the world from your mind and replaced them with the things of heaven, then surely you will have something with power to apply in your lives, and your confidence in the Lord and His Word will grow.</p>

<p>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</p>

<h1>Letter</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Fellow Pilgrims,</p>

<p>As people, we fall into the category of women, but in this world there is a wrong conception of what this means. As people, we want to know our purpose in life, and our greatest desire is to be heard, understood, and loved. There has been a reaction in our society against the oppression of women in times past. Women are encouraged to rise to their highest potential, and be recognized by those around them. In human reasoning, it seems right and noble to encourage personal accomplishment and glorification of the flesh. This is what the people of this world magnify.</p>

<p>We are reminded in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ecclesiastes+1%3A14">Ecclesiastes 1:14</a> that <span class="scripture">&#8220;all is vanity and vexation of spirit.&#8221;</span>
It is needful for us then to be watchful, for it is natural to think more highly of the flesh&#8212;whether ourselves or others&#8212;than we ought to. It is self that desires honor, and pride that encourages it. Who should be glorified and honored? Where does all good come from? If there is any praiseworthy thing in our lives, its source is God, the Creator of all that is good. In ourselves we are but dust. In a minute&#8217;s time we can be brought low, for our very breath and well being comes from God.</p>

<p>We were created to be heard, understood and loved, for God designed for us to walk in communion with Him. God is the only one who truly knows and understands our needs.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;So are my ways are higher than your ways.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+55%3A9" title="Isaiah 55:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 55:9)</span></a></span>
So, it is to God that we must go for understanding and direction for our lives. There is a way that God has planned for us to be raised up. It is a raising up to heavenly places. This is the only type of raising up that gives true meaning to our lives. This is true attainment.</p>

<p>But how can we get back to this purpose for which we were created? It was sin that separated man from God in the beginning, so
<span class="scripture">&#8220;being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+6%3A22-23" title="Romans 6:22-23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 6:22-23)</span></a></span>
We aren&#8217;t able to do this on our own. No amount of our own efforts will get us anywhere. It is only in and through the precious blood of Jesus. It is only through the death of Jesus on the cross that we can receive God&#8217;s grace. It is by God&#8217;s grace that we are saved and cleansed
<span class="scripture">&#8220;from all sin.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1%3A7" title="I&nbsp;John 1:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 1:7)</span></a></span>
In this state of reconciliation to God we are able to receive the many precious promises and privileges that are ours.</p>

<p>So many that are seeking to follow God all the way have bought into the error of the &#8220;sin you must&#8221; doctrine. Oh, it is grievous to see how the enemy of our soul has taken this advantage!
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+6%3A1-2" title="Romans 6:1-2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 6:1-2)</span></a></span>
Can we not be kept from sin by the same power by which we were saved? By denying this foundational truth we are a reproach to the name we hold, and are not living to the privileges that Jesus bought for us. Jesus came to
<span class="scripture">&#8220;grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear, In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+1%3A74-75" title="Luke 1:74-75"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 1:74-75)</span></a></span>
If God is big enough to save us from our sins, wouldn&#8217;t He have enough power to keep us from yielding to the temptations of the enemy? Jesus paid for a delivering salvation. When we allow Jesus to work in our lives, the sins that beset us will no longer have controlling power.</p>

<p>So many have not heard, let alone experienced, the works of God to this extent. Oh, do not go away deceived and believing less! If you do, you can not possibly experience the peace of mind and heart that God has for all His dear children. You may be yearning for more of God, but you cannot receive fully when you only see a limited view of Him. We serve a big, great, and wonderful God who dearly loves us and holds the key for our real deliverance. Satan knows that a great advantage is gained for God when a saint gets a hold of the deliverance in salvation, and he will take every effort to keep the truth from being received. Let us not blindly take on what is taught us, but search the scriptures to know what God desires for us to know and receive from Him. Seek God to help you trust Him as He deserves to be trusted. If we do not get a hold of this profound truth the enemy is sure to keep you from ever experiencing a victorious life. Do not get me wrong: I am not talking about not having any faults, for we are still human and we will still make mistakes. The Lord continually works on us through the fiery trials of life. If we will let Him, He will refine and perfect us into His own image. It is a continually dying to self and allowing Jesus to have the reins.</p>

<p>The Lord knows how to lead each one of us into all truth. Because of our different backgrounds, we may have gained much ground or been greatly hindered along this line. In James 4:8, it says that if we draw near to God, He will draw near to us. This is a precious promise. God knows each of our hearts and knows when a heart is earnestly seeking after Him. If you do not sense that you are any closer to the Lord than you were before, then it is your part to ask why. It takes a great deal of humility to get into a place where we really can sense our need of God, and allow Him to do His work.</p>

<p>In the Word it says that the older women are first of all to be examples of holiness, which then enables them to be teachers of good things to the younger women. When we are walking in the way of holiness, then the workings of God can be accomplished. Let us first seek the Kingdom of God, and then all (patience, soberness, contentment, etc.) shall be added unto us. Are we humble and willing to be taught of God in His way? By walking with God, we are raised up together, and made to
<span class="scripture">&#8220;sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+2%3A6" title="Ephesians 2:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 2:6)</span></a></span>

<h1>How Do I Mend This?</h1>

<h2 class="subtitle">with Sister Dorcas</h2>
<p>Since our last mending time with you, I have had an occasion to help a young lady mend a jumper that was torn to shreds in a four inch strip that had begun at the hemline and went two third&#8217;s of the way up the skirt. We didn&#8217;t have any fabric scraps for mending and if we had, the skirt was torn in 1/2 inch strips and we couldn&#8217;t sew it to anything&#8212;so we finished tearing that four inch width on up to the waist and removed it entirely! We ripped out the seam of the wasit-line; next making a seam where the torn places had been. Then we had too much fullness in the bodice, so a small dart was made, and then the skirt was stitched back to the bodice. The hemline was slip stitched and was ready to wear again! Once again mending had saved a garment and made a girl happy to have her favorite jumper back!</p>

<h1>Children Need Praise</h1>

<div class="blurb">
<p class="first">After reading these thoughts from the book <i>Seven Things Children Need</i>, I sought the Lord&#8217;s thoughts on this praise concept. The Bible was opened and my eyes fell on the following verse:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them&#8230;&#8203;the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+61%3A3" title="Isaiah 61:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 61:3)</span></a></span>
There was my answer! How faithful the Lord is to us. I thank the Lord for His mercy in showing me my need and am continually working on having
<span class="scripture">&#8220;the garment of praise.&#8221;</span>
May your family also be blessed.</p>

<p>&#8212;A mother</p>

</div>


<hr class="minor" />
<p>Benjamin West described how he became a painter. One day his mother left him with his sister Sally. He found some bottles of colored ink and decided to paint Sally&#8217;s portrait. In the process he messed up the kitchen. When his mother returned, she said nothing about the kitchen. Picking up the paper he was working on, she exclaimed, &#8220;Why, it&#8217;s Sally!&#8221; And she rewarded his effort with a kiss. West said, &#8220;My mother&#8217;s kiss that day made me a painter.&#8221;</p>

<p>William James wrote, &#8220;The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.&#8221; All of us, in the glow of feeling we have pleased, want to do more to please. When we are told we have done well, we want to do better. Dr. George W. Crane, author and social psychologist said, &#8220;The art of praising is the beginning of the fine art of pleasing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Failing to praise one&#8217;s children is a common fault of parents. Many children seldom hear a compliment. Yet they are scolded if they fail. It is all too easy to reprimand, to condemn, and to blame children, to focus on their failures and unpleasant behavior and what they didn&#8217;t do. Think of the improved conduct and sheer joy which would likely result if our words of encouragement to our children equaled or exceeded our words of criticism.</p>

<p>Martin Luther said, &#8220;Spare the rod and spoil the child&#8212;that is true. But beside the rod keep an apple handy to give him when he has done well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every day a small girl came to school dirty. The teacher thought it looked like the same dirt day after day. Being kind and understanding, she did not want to hurt the girl&#8217;s feelings or embarrass her. She knew the girl wasn&#8217;t getting the right attention at home. Maybe her parents didn&#8217;t care, but the teacher did.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have very pretty hands,&#8221; the teacher told her one day. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go to the rest room and wash them so people can see how really lovely they are?&#8221;</p>

<p>Delighted, the girl washed her hands and came back beaming. She held up her hands proudly for her teacher.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re beautiful. See what a difference a little soap and water make,&#8221; she told the girl as she hugged her warmly.</p>

<p>Every day after that, the girl came to school a bit cleaner. Eventually she was one of the neatest students in school.</p>

<p>Why did the youngster make such a change? Because someone complimented her. By praising the good points she improved.</p>

<p>Persons seldom change because we point out their faults. Nor will they love us for doing so. They will likely resent us. If we want to help others become beautiful people, we should work at it through praise and encouragement. Sincere praise is the warmth and tenderness all of us need to change for the better.</p>

<p>If we think back, it was probably the kind words of encouragement of a parent, teacher, or friend which gave us selfconfidence and the good image we have of ourselves. It was the criticism we received which causes our identity problems.</p>

<p>In his fine book, <i>Adventures in Parenthood</i>, W. Taliaferro Thompson shares the experience:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">It was the rule at our home that before a child could go out to play on Saturday morning, he had to make up his bed and clean his room. The door of the room of our eleven-year-old son was at the head of the stairs. It usually stayed open, and I looked in as I passed. If he had failed to set things right, I would go in and have words with him.</p>

<p>One morning as I was halfway down the stairs, I realized that his room was in apple pie order; I had seen it out of the corner of my eye, and I had taken note of it. If it had been in disarray, I should certainly have gone in and begun to condemn.</p>

<p>Somewhat ashamed, I retraced my steps, went in and examined his bed carefully. It was beautifully made. I could honestly compliment him on it. &#8220;Why,&#8221; I said, &#8220;this would have pleased the strictest inspector in camp. It would have passed inspection at West Point&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

<p>You have seen a halfgrown dog begin to wag his whole body when you pat him or speak to him in friendly tones; my son was affected in just that way. His response was immediate and amazing. &#8220;Daddy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll go over and get your mail.&#8221; It was at the end of the campus. &#8220;When I come back, I&#8217;ll go and get my hair cut.&#8221; We had spoken about the state of his hair several times during the week, to no avail. &#8220;When I get back from there, I think I&#8217;ll wash the car.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had given him deserved praise, then, for him, God was in His heaven, and all was right with the world. And I had come so near going on my way without saying anything about a real achievement that took time and effort and a certain amount of skill!</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[Thompson, W. Taliaferro; <i>Adventures in Parenthood</i> (Richmond: John Knox Press), pp. 47-48]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>Praising a child does not spoil the child. It is the child who does not receive praise for worthy work when the child deserves it who will seek praise in bizarre ways. So when the gang praises the child for cheating or stealing the child will naturally seek to become an expert at that.</p>

<h2>Guidelines in Giving Praise</h2>
<h3>1. Praise children&#8217;s performance, not their personality.</h3>
<p>We should praise a child for accomplishment rather than for character. After a kind word praising a child&#8217;s character, such as, &#8220;You&#8217;ve been a real good boy,&#8221; the child often responds with bad behavior. Why? The child may be fearful that he cannot live up to the goodness expected. The child feels he must, in some way, deny what he senses isn&#8217;t true.</p>

<p>One family reported on a trip. For half a day of travel, their small son in the back seat behaved so well in being quiet that the mother finally turned and said, &#8220;Billy, you&#8217;ve been a real good boy this morning.&#8221; After this compliment, there was no end of trouble. He emptied the ashtray on the seat. He made noise and threw things around. The reason? While he was quiet he was feeling mean toward everyone in the car, angry that he had to leave home just when he and his friends had made good plans for the week. When Mother said he was &#8220;good,&#8221; he knew better and needed to deny what she said.</p>

<p>Instead of commenting on character, praise should acknowledge chores well done, thoughtful acts for others, dependability, and honesty. Parents should commend a child for trying hard to do well, even when the child has not been entirely successful. Praise should point out progress.</p>

<h3>2. Praise what children are responsible for rather than that which they cannot help.</h3>
<p>For example, children cannot help it if they have beautiful hair or blue eyes. To praise a child for such things can build pride and conceit. But to praise a child for acts of kindness and generosity does not spoil a child or make a child proud. A child needs such approval for feelings of worth. A child who has the approval of others can afford to be humble. The proud or boastful child lacks a sense of personal worth.</p>

<h3>3. Recognize that praise is especially needed from people who are important to a child.</h3>
<p>Parents are the most important persons in the world to the child. The child&#8217;s world is small. Parents are the center of that world. And when parents praise a child, the child feels loved and secure. As one son observed, &#8220;It didn&#8217;t matter what any other person said. It helped a little. But when my dad said, &#8216;That&#8217;s a good job,&#8217; my world changed.&#8221;</p>

<p>To praise a teenager helps the youngster overcome timidity and develop independence. Praise develops generosity, initiative, and cooperation.</p>

<p>Lack of recognition causes a child to feel unneeded, unwanted, and that the child is a nuisance. This is true not only between parents and children, but in other relationships at school, work, or play. One school was plagued with an unusually high dropout rate. Something had to be done. An insightful person suggested that the faculty should become more communicative. He proposed that they talk with students in the halls, calling students by name if possible. The school soon developed an exceptionally low drop-out rate.</p>

<h3>4. Praise sincerely.</h3>
<p>Children know when you are sincere. They cannot be fooled. Praise dare not be phony. Flattery will fall flat. Sincerity teaches the children how to accept congratulations with ease and to receive honors with humility.</p>

<h3>5. Praise children for what they do on their own initiative.</h3>
<p>To do a worthy thing without being told deserves special encouragement. Such commendation leads to still greater selfreliance and confidence.</p>

<p>This means that a parent should be quick to praise a loser also. In a race all but one are losers. Attitudes as well as achievements are worthy of praise. To compliment a child who has tried, yet lost, gives the child courage to keep trying and motivation for the tough times every person must face.</p>

<p>Alta Mae Erb, in Christian Nurture of Children, writes, &#8220;A child may also be discouraged in selfconfidence by giving him too hard a task for his ability and then trying to hold him to a high standard of accomplishment. The comments on the first cake are more important than the taste of the cake.&#8221;</p>

<h3>6. Keep in mind that the sooner praise comes the better.</h3>
<p>If the parent is on hand when the success is realized, it is good. If the parent is present when a child has tried and not succeeded and then gives an encouraging word, it is even better.</p>

<h3>7. Remember that parents&#8217; attitudes are just as important as their words in giving encouragement.</h3>
<p>The way a parent stops to listen, the way a parent shares in the success or failure, the tone of a parent&#8217;s voice&#8212;all these create an atmosphere which encourages or discourages the child.</p>

<p>If a child lives with praise, the child learns to appreciate. An adult can get along without daily praise. A child cannot. A child must have it to develop. A child will shrivel up without praise. Fortunate is the child who receives sincere and genuine praise.</p>

<p>Will Sessions, discussing the topic &#8220;If I Had a Teenager,&#8221; says, &#8220;I would bestow praise. If the youngster blew a horn I would try to find at least one note that sounded good to my ear, and I would say a sincere word about it. If the school theme was to my liking, I would say so, hoping that it would be a good grade when it was turned in. If the choice of shirt or socks or shoes, or any other thing met my liking, I would be vocal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Probably no other thing encourages a child to love life, to seek accomplishments and gain confidence, more than proper, sincere praise&#8212;not flattery, but honest compliments when the child does well.</p>

<h1>The &#8220;Put It Away&#8221; Habit!</h1>

<p>A place for everything and everything in its place has often been said. It is one of the most important life skills anyone can learn.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s ponder . . .</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>You may learn to cook with great skill, But if you have not the &#8220;immediately put it away&#8221; habit, the kitchen will be a mess and be woefully uninviting and unappetizing.</p>

<p>Though you may be able to sew with great accuracy and speed and have not the &#8220;put it away&#8221; habit, all speed you gained will be lost!</p>

<p>Though you send many letters tied with ribbons and have not the &#8220;put it away&#8221; habit, the ribbons will soon disappear!</p>

<p>And though you clip many coupons to save money and have not the scissor-&#8220;put it away&#8221; habit, much time will be wasted.</p>

<p>And though you may read many a book and fill your head and heart with great understanding and wisdom and return not the book to an organized shelf, how are you going to refer back at an opportune time, when you have not the &#8220;put it away&#8221; habit!?</p>

<p>Even though you may be blessed with an abundance of good clothing&#8230;&#8203;premature wearing out will occur from needless washing because they were left in a heap on the floor for lack of the &#8220;hang it up&#8221; habit.</p>

<p>Cleaning day is here and you plan to accomplish much. But alas! A sweeper brush is missing&#8212;just the one you especially needed today. And where in the world has the mop bucket gone? Oh, for the &#8220;putting in proper place habit!&#8221;</p>

<p>And oh, those lost receipts and warranties. How much money was lost by not having a filing system&#8212;and the &#8220;put it away&#8221; habit?</p>

<p>Each day, hour and moment from the Lord is precious. Let us not waste many hours of life by not developing the &#8220;put it away&#8221; habit. The scripture says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+4%3A26" title="Proverbs 4:26"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 4:26)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Does it seem too hard to put things away? The Lord will help you. Claim the promise,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+4%3A13" title="Philippians 4:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 4:13)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>May the Lord help us to learn better how to &#8220;redeem the time&#8221; and to
<span class="scripture">&#8220;let all things be done decently and in order.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+14%3A40" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:40"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:40)</span></a></span>

<blockquote><p class="first">From <i>Golden Thoughts on Mother, Home, and Heaven</i></p>
</blockquote>


<h1>Mothers, Put Your Children to Bed!</h1>

<p>There may be some mothers who feel it to be a self-denial to leave their parlors, or firesides, or work, to put their children to bed. They think that the nurse could do just as well: that it is of no consequence who &#8220;hears the children say their prayers.&#8221; Now, setting aside the pleasure of opening up the little bed and tucking the darling up, there are really important reasons why the mother should not yield this privilege to any one. In the first place, it is the time of all times when a child is inclined to show confidence and affection. All little secrets come out with more truth and less restraints: naughtiness through the day can be reproved and talked over with less excitement, and with the tenderness and calmness necessary to make a permanent impression. If the little one has shown a desire to do well and be obedient, efforts and success can be acknowledged and commended in a manner that need not render the child to be vain or self-satisfied.</p>

<p>We must make it a habit to talk to our children, in order to get from them an expression of their feelings. We cannot undersand the character of these little beings commited to our care unless we do. And if we do not know what they are, we shall not be able to govern them wisely, or educate them as their different natures demand. Certainly it would be unwise to excite young children by too much conversation with them just before putting them to bed.</p>

<p>Every mother who carefully studies the temperament of her children will know how to manage them in this respect. But of this all mothers may be assured, that the last words at night are of great importance, even to the babies of the flock; the very tones of the voice they hear make an impression upon their sensitive organizations. Mothers, do not think the time and strength wasted which you spend in reviewing the day with your little boy or girl; do not neglect to teach how to pray, and pray for the child in simple and earnest language which can be understood. Soothe and quiet the little heart after the experiences of the day. The little one has had disappointments and trials as well as play and pleasures and is ready to throw his/her arms around your neck and take a good-night kiss.</p>

<h1>Maidens of Virtue and Honor</h1>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">Formerly <i>Dear Princess</i> magazine.</p>
</div>


<p>In Winter of 2000, <i>Dear Princess</i> changed to the name of <i>Maidens of Virtue and Honor</i>, and merged into a section of the publication <i>Foundation Truth</i>. As before, I, Abigail Spinks, am laboring as editress, but Skye has gone on to other things. I am striving to accomplish the work of the Lord in this section, at His direction, and would greatly desire your prayers.</p>

<h2>Standing Alone Discussion?</h2>
<p>In the last issue of Dear Princess we mentioned that we were planning a &#8220;Standing Alone&#8221; discussion topic for the next section of <i>Maidens of V and H</i>, however as time went on, we simply did not feel God&#8217;s blessing on it and though we recieved a few submissions on the topic we did not feel that God&#8217;s blessing was in this topic for this time. We&#8217;re sorry we didn&#8217;t mention this last issue&#8212;it quite slipped our minds. We appreciate those who wrote and perhaps may have this disscussion another time, but for now we will not. See &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_2/We_Need_Your_Help/index.html">We Need Your Help!</a>&#8221; for the discussion topic that we feel the Lord wants us to pursue at this time. If you feel burdened we would be most interested to see your articles upon this subject.</p>

Has the Lord done anything for you? We would be so encouraged to hear about it! Whether you have found any helpful tips or hints in learning a skill, or the Lord has been teaching you a lesson, given you help or answered prayer, please feel free to share. In this way, you can encourage, challenge, and strengthen others in the right, for we are called to
<span class="scripture">&#8220;consider one another to provoke [stir up, spur] unto love and to good works.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A24" title="Hebrews 10:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 10:24)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>If you are feeling like you have nothing to share, please search your heart and find why. As daughters of the King, our hearts should be full of His praises, and lips ready to tell of His goodness. If that is not the case, we should find out what ails us. Don&#8217;t be cheated out of the blessing of sharing what the Lord has done for you or is teaching you! Do not let the devil tell you it is boastful or prideful to write and share what God has taught you&#8212;you are only glorifying the Teacher, which we are commanded to do.</p>

<p>We would greatly appreciate hearing from mothers, grandmothers, older sisters&#8212;we have much to learn from you. Please do write and

<p>Greetings in Jesus&#8217; Holy Name! I hope this finds you well. I wanted to tell you what a wonderful blessing this last issue of Dear Princess was (<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_10/index.html" title="Dear Princess 10">Summer 1999</a>). Thank you&#8230;&#8203;for putting out an inspiring and Godly magazine free of charge&#8230;&#8203;the content is great; <i>especially</i> this last issue. I was very encouraged by the theme. I, too, have pondered the whole idea of focusing on the Lord Jesus and just letting Him have His way in My everyday life, and in my future. It&#8217;s good not to make plans and dream of the future if you have given it to the Lord! Last year I gave the next seven years of my life to the Lord for his service. He has been faithful to guide me and keep me in His way. Though I might not choose singleness, I will gladly be single if that is His will for me. Some people might say, &#8220;How could you do <i>that</i>? I think that if He gave His life for me, how could I give any less back to Him? A week or so ago, I copied excerpts from
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+7">I&nbsp;Corinthians 7</a> onto a 5 by 7 card. I have it on my mirror so I can see it often&#8230;&#8203;maybe you&#8217;d enjoy these precious verses:</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;I say therefore to the unmarried&#8230;. It is good for them if they abide even as I&#8230;. Let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God. Art thou loosed from a [husband]? seek not a [husband]&#8230;. that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction&#8230;. She is happier if she so abide, after my judgement: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+7%3A8%2C24%2C27%2C35%2C40" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 7:8,24,27,35,40"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 7:8,24,27,35,40)</span></a></span></p>

<p>May you continue to grow in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ!</p>

<p class="signature">Your fellow sister in Jesus,<br />Mollie Jo Cassidy&#8212;<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+3%3A7-10">Philippians 3:7-10</a><br />Fort Worth, TX</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Note: We appreciate the sincerity of Mollie and her desire to please the Lord and stay consecrated to His will. We did want to mention that we believe consecrating the next seven years of our lives is a good step, but only a step, considering that God wants <i>full</i> consecration for our entire life. Giving up a portion of our lives seems to indicate that the rest will be for ourselves. We must give God all&#8212;childhood, girlhood, womanhood, married life (if this is His will), old age&#8212;every aspect and time in our lives until He calls us home to heaven. If the Lord calls us to be married, we will need every bit of the full consecration that we gave before as we will certainly not be without trials&#8212;God is too merciful to do that! It is vital that we do not get cheated out of the full peace and joy of entire consecration with a partial giving up of self and self&#8217;s ways.</p>

<p>If the thought is meant that we are to give amount of years in <i>singleness</i> devoted to God, does this not seem but a lack of surrender to His Divine will, though it may look good on the surface? Dear sisters, let us not fall into the trap of &#8220;planning for God&#8221;&#8212;seven or ten or even five years of &#8220;singleness&#8221; sounds noble and self-sacrificing&#8212;&#8220;I will not marry during the next four years, I will spend this time in absolute devotion to God and His will and purpose.&#8221; But what if it is the Lord&#8217;s will for you to serve Him in marriage during this time? What if this is how He wants your absolute devotion? Marriage is not second-class service&#8212;neither is singlehood nor any other stage in life. Singleness is not better&#8212;nor marriage&#8212;but being in the center of the circle of the will of God is best. Sisters, let us yield our heart, soul, mind and strength&#8212;all&#8212;to God that He may direct our path into His perfectness. He knows best.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Had I the choosing of my pathway<br />In blindness I should go astray,<br />And wander far away in darkness,<br />Nor reach that land of endless day.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;God&#8217;s way is best, I will not murmur,<br />Although the end I may not see;<br />Where&#8217;er He leads I&#8217;ll meekly follow,<br />God&#8217;s way is best, is best for me.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Gods_Way_Is_Best/index.html" title="God's Way Is Best">*</a></p>

<p>My dear sisters in Christ,</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;As it is written: No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love Him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+2%3A9" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 2:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 2:9)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New International Version">NIV</span> Isn&#8217;t that such a beautiful verse for God&#8217;s children?

<p>I especially thank Him tonight for sending you girls into my life. You have been such a Godly encouragement to me through your lives and your magazine. Keep on keeping on for Jesus&#8230;&#8203;</p>

<p>The latest issue of Dear Princess (<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_10/index.html" title="Dear Princess 10">Summer 1999</a>) was so rich and full. I very much desire to continue receiving it. The poem, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_10/What_Else/index.html" title="Dear Princess 10/What Else?">What Else?</a>&#8221; almost sent the tears spilling. What else could Christ have done to show His love towards us? Nothing&#8212;what a glorious thought. He has poured His love into us&#8230;. How can the world so openly mock and reject His perfect love? I cannot understand the cold hearts of today. My heart cries. Thank you for printing &#8220;What Else&#8221;&#8212;it touched me deeply.</p>

<p>Yesterday found me very contemplative. I heard of a tragedy and it left me deep in thought the rest of the day. I questioned the Lord, &#8220;Why did you allow such a thing to happen? I cannot understand it.&#8221; God taught me several lessons through this and gave me comfort in several verses which I&#8217;ll share with you. I hope they might be a comfort to someone else&#8230;.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Though you have made me see troubles, many and bitter, you will restore my life again; from the depths of the earth you will again bring me up.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+71%3A20" title="Psalm 71:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 71:20)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New International Version">NIV</span></p>

<p>May we always remember that God&#8217;s ways are not our ways. He sees the whole picture. He knows exactly what He is doing in all things.</p>

<p>Today was a busy day of sewing. Mom and I were able to complete one dress and make progress on another. Oh, my hands seem so clumsy next to Mom&#8217;s sure steady hands as we both handle the fabric. I am learning to be a better seamstress inch by inch&#8230;&#8203;&#8220;stitch by stitch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yesterday we were able to gather three baskets full of apples. We are hoping to can apple pie filling this Monday. I can just smell the apple pies coming out of the oven on a snowy December day.</p>

<p>I very much enjoyed the article, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_10/Dying_to_the_Vision_of_Marriage/index.html" title="Dear Princess 10/Dying to the Vision of Marriage">Dying to the Vision of Marriage</a>,&#8221; as well as <a href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess_10/Our_Appointment/index.html" title="Dear Princess 10/Our Appointment">Laura&#8217;s article</a> on being the prudent wife of tomorrow. Thank you for printing articles which exhort and encourage.</p>

<p>I will close with this hymn. The words really &#8220;hit home.&#8221; Keep your eyes on Jesus! I will be praying for you, dear sisters.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;I wonder, have I done my best for Jesus?<br />Who died upon the cruel tree?<br />To think of His great sacrifice at Calvary!<br />I know the Lord expects the best from me.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;I wonder have I cared enough for others,<br />Or have I let them die alone?<br />I might have helped a wanderer to my Savior,<br />The seed of precious life I might have sown.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;No longer will I stay in the valley&#8212;<br />I&#8217;ll climb to mountain heights above;<br />The world is dying now for want of someone<br />Who will tell them of the Savior&#8217;s matchless love.</p>

<p class="verse refrain_line">Refrain:</p><p class="verse refrain">&#8220;How many are the lost that I have lifted?<br />How many are the chains I&#8217;ve set free?<br />I wonder, have I done my best for Jesus,<br />When He has done so much for me?&#8221;</p>

<p class="noindent">Greetings in the Precious Name of the Lord!</p>

<p>&#8230;&#8203;There is such a great sin in turning to anything or anybody to make you feel like &#8220;somebody.&#8221; Oh, what a price has been paid by the King of Glory; the worth of us being His own life&#8217;s blood! Surely the worth of that sacrifice to buy us back from bondage, united to Himself, makes &#8220;nobodies&#8221; so loved and treasured.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be found in Him&#8221; will be the title of an article [I hope to write]. Please pray that the Lord will provide time in the word, clear thoughts and words for it. What a struggle it seems for me, but it has become labor sweet for Him. He is with me, and in this work [of writing], so it is good.</p>

<p>Love and richest blessings of Heaven to you,</p>

<h2>&#8220;Let it Not Be the Outward Adorning&#8221;&#8212;A Reader Discussion on Jewelry and Make-up</h2>
<p>Several of our readers have written in asking how we feel about jewelry and make-up. The world says this is neccesary to be beautiful. What does God say? We have been asked to have a reader discussion on it and after almost a year of prayer and waiting, we feel God&#8217;s blessing in pursuing this topic. We ask that you would prayerfully read the questions below and consider writing and sharing what you feel God has taught you. Please measure your beliefs to the Bible before writing and keep a loving, holy spirit in sharing.</p>

<p><b>We can&#8217;t have a discussion by ourselves!</b> Please do write&#8212;we want to hear your comments and questions; we do not desire to have a one-sided, closed-minded discussion. Thank you so much!</p>

<ul>
<li>Does the Bible teach a standard of Godly dress or is it mainly up to each one of us how we prefer to dress?</li>

<li>In the Old Testament women wore jewelry; is this true of saved sisters in the New Testament?</li>

<li>Are we beautifying, making attractive, the gospel by wearing make-up and jewelry?</li>

<li>What is the motive of the heart in putting on these things?</li>

<li>Does putting on jewelry and make-up glorify God? Or is it a hindrance to God shining through us?</li>

<li>If it has been your experience that God has convicted you of plainness, how have you dealt with the scorn and accusations of being a fanatic, etc. from others?</li>

</ul>
<p>Other questions are welcome; we look forward to hearing from you and discussing this Bible subject!</p>

<h1>A Letter of Love</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>Do you want what you&#8217;re preparing for your future? Every step, every little minute of our lives is a building block&#8212;every trial, yes, but everything else as well&#8212;the friends we choose, the thoughts we let our minds entertain, yes, those too shape us imaginably for our future, both in this life and for all eternity. We have been given life, sisters; I wish I could impress upon you the seriousness that I feel that is in this responsibility to live. I am sure I do not, can not, understand it fully and expect to grasp the meaning more clearly as I grow older. But even now I can see it is serious to be given life. Once we have life, we will live forever&#8212;in heaven or hell. We cannot escape existence once we are alive. If our physical bodies are killed, we live on&#8212;forever. Forever is a word that escapes the mind&#8212;we can not fathom forever, but forever is there, and we are preparing for our forever. Surely this ought to be a great weight on us how we handle life and what we allow our minds to think and do, for everything is simply preparation blocks for tomorrow&#8217;s forever. We must surely realize that this great task of preparation is much too big for us! Thankfully, we were never meant to go alone through life, but were to take a Guide who knows the route perfectly and will lead us safely home. It is only our part to lean closely to our loving Guide, to listen for His still, small voice. Many have said the voice is not there and charted their own path recklessly, ending in sorrow and torment; but He is there, ready and waiting to lead those who will become still enough to hear Him. I am trusting God to help me pen the words in this letter to you, for the subject is a difficult and delicate subject and I greatly desire God&#8217;s help to express the burden I feel.</p>

<p>Through our childhood, we have (or more accurately, our parents have) been building, as said beforehand, to make the person we are now. Now that we young ladies have entered the teenage years, well-termed &#8220;the unsettled years&#8221;&#8212;we have broached upon a place where we are making the most critical decisions of life, building the most fundamental parts of our lives&#8212;what we believe&#8212;coming to the place of realizing why we are here and what we are supposed to do. We have all experienced childhood ideals, but very little of these dreams comes to fruition. Are we going to waste our girlhood dreaming useless dreams as well? It is the place of childhood to imagine and explore, hopefully managed properly with an understanding mother and father, guiding and shaping the little mind. But now is not the time to dream and build air castles. Now is the time, the critical time, for preparation for the battles and trials of the adult life God has wisely planned for our course, if we heed His direction.</p>

<p>Back to childhood for a moment. For most of us, as little girls we loved our baby dolls, playing that we were cooking and washing clothes&#8212;being little Mamas. God put this desire into us, and it is sweet and precious to see this quality in little girls. If you get a group of girls together that are undamaged emotionally, they will almost always want to &#8220;play house.&#8221; This is important preparation, though the girls do not realize it. How little girls respond to their dolls is how they will respond to their children. Little girls ought to spend a great portion of their time playing house&#8212;it is preparation for the God-given role God has called them to fulfill.</p>

<p>When a girl gets a little older, attraction to the opposite gender is aroused and she begins to think of boys&#8212;termed by the world, &#8220;predating time.&#8221; For those who are more conservative, this is the time when courtship is introduced, and the girls are told that someday they will have a husband, but must wait until they are older and God brings it about. This seems exciting&#8212;waiting at home until a knight on a white horse comes and sweeps you up and off you go, knowing that it is God&#8217;s perfect match for you. As the years roll by and this doesn&#8217;t happen, fantasy dreams come to make up for disappointing realility. If a girl really had the vision that God would provide in His timing, the unrealistic and extremely romantic dreams hinder that vision, to say the least. It takes more than a trust in God that He will provide&#8212;that vision is needed&#8212;it takes the consecration that if God wills, you are willing to go without God providing the dearly longed, loved and looked for&#8212;a husband and family of your own. You cannot dream of romanticism and keep a consecration of that sort in your heart. It is impossible. To wait on God and not enter the dating game&#8212;physically or mentally&#8212;takes this real consecration to trust God that He is working out His purpose, whether it is what we want or not. Whether we see things &#8220;happening&#8221; or not. We must,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+4%3A18" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 4:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 4:18)</span></a></span>
However, we don&#8217;t float into looking at unseen things and consecrating of our futures to God, laying all at His dear feet. It takes work, tears, denying of self and a lot of letting go&#8230;&#8203;and letting God. Letting go of dreams, air castles we hold dear, letting go of what is naturally ours to have. Too many never come to this place. Because they never &#8220;get it,&#8221; and since they don&#8217;t believe in &#8220;the dating game,&#8221; something must take place of the natural flesh that craves attention. This is where romance novels and other such junk comes in. &#8220;Christian&#8221; romance novels are a tool of the devil. These books stimulate the mind in a remarkably ungodly way so that you can date continually in your mind without even going out physically to do it. The devil has fixed it so that on the outside girls can testify that they are waiting for God to give them companions, but on the inside, in the privacy of their thoughts, they attend balls and dances and date around as much as any worldly person. Many girls justify that it doesn&#8217;t hurt&#8212;it is just &#8220;fantasy&#8221; after all. Many, filled with fear that God will never provide, are enslaved and no more trust God with providing a husband than an atheist does. Block upon block, they build their lives with the stubble that dating brings, all the while professing they do not believe in what they are doing. Actions speak louder then words. Time flies and every minute we prepare for our future whether or not we perceive it&#8212;discontentment, fairy-tell living, distrust, wasted time, and a lot of other &#8220;straw, hay and stubble&#8221; are built. Many girls build divorce into their lives years before they are married. Hours, days, weeks, months, years are spent in profitless building. Dear friends, if we are put here for a purpose, how can we use our time in such a manner? Why would we want to waste our time this way? Many don&#8217;t. Many actually long to really be all the Lord&#8217;s, and to trust in Him completely for their future. They long to be consecrated and to possess the blessing that comes when we cannot say yes or no, but only, &#8220;whatsoever the Lord wills, so be it done unto me.&#8221; If so many people long for it, then why don&#8217;t we have a whole lot of consecrated people, an example and glorifying God? Is it that God doesn&#8217;t want to give us a full trust in Him? The very statement denies itself. God has said that
<span class="scripture">&#8220;no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+84%3A11" title="Psalm 84:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 84:11)</span></a></span>
The fault cannot lie with God. It must be with us.</p>

<p>There is a portion in one of Brother C. E. Orr&#8217;s books<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../texts/The_Instruction_of_Youth_in_the_Christian_Life/Shall_Not_Want/index.html" title="The Instruction of Youth in the Christian Life/Shall Not Want">*</a> that gives an illustration on why people aren&#8217;t more spiritual. He likened it to looking at a pair of shoes for sale. You like the shoes&#8212;you want to buy them. But the price is high. Let&#8217;s say $100&#8212;that is a lot of money. However, you really, really, want the shoes&#8212;you know you need them, in fact, will probably perish without them&#8212;the person selling them says he wants you to have them too, but you walk away without buying the shoes. Why? You want them; the person selling it wants you to have the shoes; why didn&#8217;t you get them? There is something you want more: the $100. You must surrender that if you are to get the shoes, and that you are unwilling to do. The price is what stands between you and wearing those much-needed shoes.</p>

<p>It is the same with us. God wants us to be consecrated&#8212;He wants our entire will for our future, but there is a price. He knows how good it would be for us to give it to Him. But before our receiving of the blessing, we must pay the price. Too many are unwilling to pay the price. They would rather shuffle their ragged feet, torn and bleeding; rather read the novels and indulge in unprofitable thoughts, untrust, and worldly matter. They know their way is not best, but they would rather follow it anyway because the price would cost them all they enjoy. They would rather have the fun, not really realizing they are missing the peace and joy.</p>

<p>A woman said to my mother the other day, &#8220;When my husband gets off, I just straighten him right up.&#8221;</p>

<p>My mother replied, &#8220;It is much better to let God straighten him out&#8212;He knows what He is doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>She responded, &#8220;Yes, it is, but God doesn&#8217;t get to him as fast as I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Girls, are we going to be like that? Are we going to say, &#8220;God&#8217;s way is best, but I don&#8217;t want to wait&#8212;I don&#8217;t want to pay the price; God isn&#8217;t fast enough. He isn&#8217;t bringing any one along to court me. God has forgotten me! I&#8217;m going to miss out! I better help God out a little&#8212;if I don&#8217;t read these books, I won&#8217;t know how to relate to a man.&#8221; Or: &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t hurt to nourish a &#8216;crush&#8217;&#8212;it is only in the mind. God has promised us to have abundant life, and if I can&#8217;t do it in real life, I can at least imagine it! No one will ever know&#8212;I&#8217;ll just have a little fun before God gets around to bringing me a companion.&#8221; Oh, dear girls, how can you waste your God-given life? How can we ever say that God&#8217;s price is too high to pay? Our ways may have some infatuations that are &#8220;fun&#8221;; but it is not God&#8217;s way and will never end with God&#8217;s blessing. The way our flesh would choose may seem pleasant, but for however long they may seem good, there will come a day when all pleasure of sin will vanish away as the grass that fadeth. God&#8217;s way is best because it ends best.</p>

<p>As a personal testimony: when I was nine, I read several romance novels from the library&#8212;I was fascinated. My older sister read them, with caution, and my father allowed that, but he forbade me to read them. I quit, and was glad I did when the Lord saved me later that year, but the contents of those books linger with me yet and I have fought untold battles concerning them. For years, not having a good hold of trusting God, I &#8220;dated&#8221; in my mind. I really struggled at times, knowing that this was not the best. But it was fascinating to me. One day in my devotions I was praying, why was it so hard for me to stay consecrated in my mind and heart? Why couldn&#8217;t I meet a man without analyzing him to see if he would make a good husband? This was not trust in God, and I truly desired to get the victory. Opening up my Bible, my eyes fell on the scripture;
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Why art thou wroth? And why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+4%3A6-7" title="Genesis 4:6-7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 4:6-7)</span></a></span>
It was so true that I felt speechless. It was so very clear, so very simple. My dear sisters, if we are struggling with something in our lives; if we cannot come to a point of consecration, is there not a cause? There was with me. Yes, true as always, sin lay at the door of my problem. All the tears, all the sleepless nights I spent in vain trying to find an answer to why I didn&#8217;t have the victory&#8212;why certain thoughts I knew were wrong plagued me; it all boiled down to one clear thing; at the bottom, veiled securely, I really actually enjoyed the entertaining thoughts that wanted to abide in my heart&#8212;it was fun to not trust God, though at times, it was absolute misery. It takes the Lord to reveal our condition to ourselves. I had tried my royal best to be consecrated, to lay down my will and replace it with God&#8217;s perfect one, but in the end, it takes Jesus to show us what hinders and it takes Him to remove the hindrances after we&#8217;re willing to pay the price. It took Jesus to deliver me from myself. But praise the Lord, He did! He is able. It is a blessing to trust and know that He doeth all things well. That is what our preparation comes down to, my sisters, is simply leaving ourselves into His hands. Paying the price, giving it all up and then, simply resting! Just,</p>

<p class="verse">Leaning on the arms of Jesus,<br />Oh, it is so sweet and precious!<br />He will surely bless and keep us,<br />Calmly resting free from care.</p>

<p class="verse">Leaning, leaning,<br />Safely on the arms of Jesus,<br />I&#8217;m leaning, yes, leaning,<br />Leaning on the arms of Jesus.<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Leaning_on_the_Arms_of_Jesus/index.html" title="Leaning on the Arms of Jesus">*</a></p>

<p>I had in mind to write much more&#8212;on some of the practical aspects of preparation, but I feel now that this is all God wants me to share at this time. What a blessing it is to know that when we are fully consecrated to God&#8217;s will, we do not have to worry about things&#8212;anything. When He says go, we go; when He says stop, we stop. He is the Master, and we are the willing servant. As servants we can experience full, pure joy and peace when being at home with our Lord and Master. We don&#8217;t have to worry about food or clothing or relationships or any such thing. We do not have to be fearful that we are on the wrong path, or that God will leave us lonely and in the dark. It is good to be at home with Father in His loving care. Will you not come home, too?</p>

<p class="verse">Let us sing a sweet song of the home of the soul,<br />The glorious place of our rest;<br />It is not far away in the heavens untold,<br />But deep in the Infinite breast.</p>

<p class="verse">He that dwelleth in love ever dwelleth in God,<br />Sweet home never clouded by fears,<br />And this heaven of love is our native abode;<br />Through time and eternity&#8217;s years.</p>

<p class="verse">We are only at home in the bosom of God,<br />On earth or in heaven above;<br />Everyone who would enter must pass through the blood,<br />And reign in the kingdom of love.</p>

<p class="verse">Do not venture the hope that is waiting for death<br />To waft you to comfort and peace;<br />There&#8217;s no rest for a soul, in this world or above,<br />Not saved in the Father&#8217;s embrace.</p>

<p class="verse">We will enter no door that is opened by men<br />Who promise a home for the soul;<br />For in Christ we abide, in the church that will stand<br />While ages eternally roll.</p>

<p class="verse refrain_line">Refrain:</p><p class="verse refrain">I&#8217;m at home, blessed home,<br />I am safe in the bosom Divine;<br />Oh, the home of the soul,<br />Thy heaven of glory is mine.<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/The_Home_of_the_Soul/index.html" title="The Home of the Soul">*</a></p>
