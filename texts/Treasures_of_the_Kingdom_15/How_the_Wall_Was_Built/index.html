<p>Grandpa and the children had been looking at a book of Bible places. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a picture of Jerusalem,&#8221; Alice pointed out. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t the walls have to be built several times?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Grandpa. &#8220;Let me tell you the story of Nehemiah…&#8221;</p>

<h1>How the Wall Was Built</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Nehemiah+2-6">Nehemiah 2-6</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">It had been many years since kings ruled in Jerusalem. After a long time in captivity many of the Israelites had returned again to their beloved city, with its crumbling walls and burnt gates. Among those that now lived there was the family of Benjamin, and we shall call his children Amon and Naomi.</p>

<p>Their house was at the city&#8217;s edge, with a narrow street in front that led to the old tower where the king&#8217;s house had been. Amon and Naomi were always glad when their work was done, because then they could explore along the old wall and find new passages to the fields outside. But Father was troubled. &#8220;We are in danger from our enemies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They say our God has forsaken us because we are poor and the wall is broken down.&#8221; So they prayed for God to send them help.</p>

<p>And God did, for a man came from the palace of Sushan on important business. Amon heard it and told Naomi, &#8220;The men of the city are having a meeting. I wonder what it is about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good news,&#8221; Father said, when he came in. &#8220;God has sent Nehemiah, with aid from the king, that the walls may be rebuilt. Tomorrow we will begin.&#8221; Naomi clapped her hands in excitement, but Amon ran out to look at the wall. It was quite broken down and looked like a lot of work. But Father was cheerful. &#8220;God will help us,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>And it was a lot of work. Amon&#8217;s job was to chisel at the boulders Father brought and Naomi was soon filling an apron with rubble to haul away. Everyone else was working, too. Mother and the other woman cooked for the workers, and none of the children had time to play anymore. But they sang and talked while the hammers clanged and the chisels chipped. Until one day…</p>

<p>&#8220;Our enemies are plotting to attack us in the work.&#8221; The word was passed all along the wall. It was Nehemiah that called them all together. Amon and Naomi watched as he handed out weapons and said, &#8220;Be not afraid, but remember the Lord.&#8221; So, from that day on, half of the men held spears and bows, and even Father had to keep a sword at his side while he worked. Naomi couldn&#8217;t go outside the walls, and even Amon worked with his ears listening for the trumpet warning. But day after day the wall grew taller, and no trouble came.</p>

<p>At last the great day came. The gates had been bolted in and the wall stood high and strong. As Amon and Naomi watched Father clean his tools, they were glad that they had helped. God had given them protection and strength to do this important work: the wall had been built in only fifty-two days. &#8220;The Lord has been good to us,&#8221; Father said. &#8220;We will serve Him and obey His ways.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>


<p>&#8220;Wow!&#8221; said Edward, looking at the book. &#8220;See those rocks and how tall the wall is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God really did help them, didn&#8217;t He?&#8221; Alice added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, for it was done in a very short time,&#8221; said Grandpa. &#8220;The Bible says, &#8216;The people had a mind to work,&#8217; so that helped a lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does that mean that they used their mind?&#8221; Edward was curious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8230;&#8203;&#8221; Grandpa said with a chuckle, &#8220;Not exactly. Having a mind to do something is to set your will and determine to do it. It is your attitude that makes you work hard or get lazy or discouraged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be lazy. I would work hard,&#8221; said Sammy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like cleaning up your room?&#8221; asked Alice. &#8220;Maybe you should have a mind to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will!&#8221; said Sammy, jumping up. &#8220;I will pretend I&#8217;m building the wall, and God will help me.&#8221;</p>
