<h1>A Big-Enough Father</h1>

<p>&#8220;The only thing I can think of is selling a few things. We could do without the truck, and Grandpa&#8217;s secretary desk&#8230;.&#8221; Dad&#8217;s voice sounded tired. Rosie stopped her window wiping to listen. There was a scraping of chairs and she could hear the swish of Mom&#8217;s mop on the kitchen floor.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_15/father_cleaning.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="296" /></div>
<p>&#8220;But, Walter, I can cut back on the grocery bill first,&#8221; she was saying. &#8220;We&#8217;ll save where we can before selling; the pantry is stocked, and I can scrimp and save.&#8221; Her voice rose and fell with the sound of scrubbing, sounding more and more determined.</p>

<p>Rosie glanced at Daniel who was standing motionless with the duster. They both knew that Dad had hurt his back and couldn&#8217;t work, but having him home every day had been fun. Except for yesterday, when the letter had come from Eastwood Construction. Ever since Dad had been writing numbers on paper or sitting in the big chair with his eyes shut. Mom said that Dad had lost his job, and now&#8230;.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did Dad lose his money, too?&#8221; Rosie asked, feeling suddenly cold.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; Daniel&#8217;s eyes were wide and he spoke slowly. &#8220;When Earl&#8217;s dad lost <i>his</i> job they had to move. They didn&#8217;t have any money and soon they were poor and&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did they have to sell everything?&#8221; Rosie looked around at the couches, book shelf, and her own warm dress.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Daniel said, frowning, &#8220;but poor people can&#8217;t buy things, and they wear old clothes and don&#8217;t have friends or anything.&#8221; There was a hopeless sound in his voice and Rosie shivered. Slowly she began again to wipe the window, but the cloudy cold sky only seemed to frown in on her.</p>

<p>At the lunch table everyone was unusually quite. When Irene asked if there was any more mayonnaise, Mom shook her head slowly. Dad set down his spoon and said, &#8220;Children, with me without work now we especially need all of your help to make the money stretch. We&#8217;ll have to do with less, and trust God to provide our needs.&#8221; Dad&#8217;s voice was calm, but he did not smile. Rosie&#8217;s eyes met Daniel&#8217;s, and the dreadful coldness came tumbling back. What would happen now?</p>

<p>That afternoon Emma wanted to play with dolls, but Rosie only shook her head. How could she be happy when everything was so dark and gloomy? Even the dolls seemed to say, &#8220;What will happen to us?&#8221; Rosie turned from the cradle where Ally and Mae lay so quietly and hurried to the bedroom. Her heart felt heavy and sad. Closing the door she sat on the edge of her bed to think.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can I do?&#8221; she kept saying to herself, and then she remembered. She could pray! Falling on her knees, Rosie began telling Jesus all about it. &#8220;And You know, dear Lord, about everything. I remember I should ask You for everything I need, so please help us that we won&#8217;t be poor and have to move. Please help Daddy have a job. And I thank You, amen.&#8221; It seemed that the heaviness had all flown away, for when Rosie got up she felt all happy and warm inside. &#8220;Oh, I just know it,&#8221; she said to herself. &#8220;God is so big and He will surely take care of everything!&#8221; A gleam of sunshine burst through the clouds, and with a laugh Rosie skipped out of the room.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_15/father_doll.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="419" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Mae darling, we just will have to stretch the cereal today,&#8221; Rosie said, seating the brown-haired doll next to a wooden crate. &#8220;But don&#8217;t you worry any, because God will take care of us.&#8221; Emma put two plastic bowls and a tiny pitcher on the &#8220;table,&#8221; then ran to wake her baby.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is God like our father?&#8221; she asked, after Rosie had said the blessing. &#8220;You said, &#8216;Dear Heavenly Father&#8217; when you thanked Him for the food.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosie stopped feeding her baby doll and looked up in surprise. &#8220;I guess He really is,&#8221; she said softly, then a new thought came to her. &#8220;Do you know Emma? We really have lots of money and everything, because our Father God owns the whole world!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And God&#8217;s really big,&#8221; Emma said solemnly, rocking her dolly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Children, dear,&#8221; Rosie said, turning to her dolls again, &#8220;don&#8217;t you worry if we are poor. Father can take care of everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a few minutes later, when Rosie went to get a washcloth, that she found Daniel sitting on his bedroom floor. Plink-clank-clank! Rosie stood in the hall and watched him as he shook pennies out of his piggy bank. Clink-clankity-clank!</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing, Daniel?&#8221; she asked, sitting down beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Counting my money.&#8221; His voice was gloomy and hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Rosie asked in a surprised voice. &#8220;Are you going to buy something?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m just seeing if I have enough for&#8212;I mean, how much&#8212;&#8221; Daniel&#8217;s voice quavered off in a little moan, &#8220;but it isn&#8217;t enough. Nobody has enough money!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But God does,&#8221; Rosie said, cheerfully. &#8220;And I know He will take care of us. I&#8217;m not afraid anymore, even if we are poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor!&#8221; Daniel cried, &#8220;You don&#8217;t even know how bad it&#8217;ll be!&#8221; Rosie saw him tremble and remembered how afraid she had felt.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Daniel, God is just like our Father; He&#8217;s big enough for anything, I just know it. And He loves us just like Daddy, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you be so sure?&#8221; Daniel said glumly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; Rosie began slowly, &#8220;because Jesus made me so happy and&#8212;and Daniel, I wished you would believe Him. He <i>can</i> help, and He loves us so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem like it,&#8221; Daniel said. His eyes looked up and they were very dark and sad. Rosie didn&#8217;t know what to say, and her heart sank.</p>

<p>But God <i>was</i> big enough, no matter what Daniel thought. And then she knew what she could do. She would pray that Daniel could be happy and see the sunshine, too. Her Heavenly Father could show him that He <i>was</i> bigger than all those pennies.</p>

<h1>Are You Afraid?</h1>

<p>Have you ever been afraid, like Rosie was? I am sure you have at least once. It is not a good feeling, is it? You feel shivery and alone and things look dark and gloomy. Maybe it was a noise in the night, or a dark room, or even some kind of animal. When we don&#8217;t know what will happen, we can get fearful. Our heart beats fast and we feel like we are trapped. What can we do to be safe?</p>

<p>What can we do when we are afraid? We can talk to Jesus. It is wonderful to know that He is never worried or fearful. He said, &#8220;All power is given unto Me,&#8221; and, that He would be with us always. So if we tell the Lord about our troubles, we can know He will take care of them. He is a wonderful Friend that we can snuggle close to and be safe. When a dark shadow or a scary dream frighten you, think about Jesus and remember He is close by. And He will give warm sunshine to fill your heart.</p>

<p>Lots of times when we have problems, we can run to Mom and Dad. They are big and strong, and they love us, too. When we are with them, we feel safe. But sometimes troubles come that they can&#8217;t help&#8212;like Rosie&#8217;s Dad losing his job. What can we do then? We can talk to God about it. We call Him our Heavenly Father, and do you think He is too busy to notice when we need Him? Surely not! He wants us to run to Him with our troubles, just like your Daddy does. And He is big enough to take care of <i>every single one</i>. Nothing is too hard for Him!</p>

<p>Are you afraid? Jesus says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+13%3A5" title="Hebrews 13:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 13:5)</span></a></span> If you trust in Him, He will take care of you and keep you safe.</p>

<h1>The Giant Elephant: Gentleness</h1>

<p>Perhaps you have only seen this great animal in pictures, but with a long, bendable nose and flapping ears you know who she is. An elephant, of course! These animals live in herds on the African plains and in the jungles of Asia. In the wild our friend lives in a big family, called a herd, that works and plays together. The elephant is the biggest animal on land&#8212;taller than your ceiling and too big to squeeze through the door. But the wonderful thing about her is that she is gentle.</p>

<p>When you think of bears and lions and rhinoceroses, you think of fierce animals that will hurt you. But even though the elephant is bigger and stronger than them all, she lives peaceably with other animals. Even if the elephant is angry, she will only try to scare away the troublesome enemy, not hurt it. Isn&#8217;t this a good example to us? If you are bigger and stronger than the other children around, choose to be gentle like the elephant. Don&#8217;t push your own way, but work to help and show you care. Gentleness makes your strength beautiful and good.</p>

<p>One of the strongest things the elephant has is her giant trunk. This nose is quite amazing, for it can pick up a tiny peanut, squirt water, or pull up a tree. Since the elephant can use it in so many ways, you might think she would be selfish with it. But, no, God made her to be a very caring animal. If a baby elephant is hurt, she will help it up. When a sick friend can not move, she will bring it food. Just like our arms, she uses her trunk to do good and show love, even perhaps to give a &#8220;cheer-up&#8221; hug to one that is down.</p>

<p>How about us? Will we show gentleness and think of others first? Show that you care in little helping ways. Give a little pat to encourage your brother or a quiet kind word when your friend starts to argue. Remember, gentleness is giant strength. In the Bible it talks about God&#8217;s gentleness making us great. Jesus was gentle. He showed us His greatness by loving us and helping us, even when we were His enemies and had disobeyed. Don&#8217;t you think being gentle is greater than being hard and mean?</p>

<p>We like mashed potatoes better than hard raw ones, don&#8217;t we? So we like the softness in someone&#8217;s words, rather than meanness. Potatoes have to be cooked to be made soft. Scrub the potatoes and poke them well. We don&#8217;t want them to puff up and explode! Now bake them in a hot oven (400*) for at least half an hour. Poke a fork in and see if they are soft. If not, bake some more. When a fork goes in easily, remove them with pot holders and cut them in half. When they are cooled a bit, scoop out the fluffy insides and mash with salt, pepper, a bit of milk and butter. Taste and see if it isn&#8217;t just the thing for dinner! We are kind of like potatoes in God&#8217;s kitchen&#8212;we might need scrubbing, poking and baking, too.</p>

<h2>RECIPE for Gentleness:</h2>
<p>Upon arising pray for love.</p>

<p>Mix it with kindness throughout the day.</p>

<p>To perfect the taste, bake it in a trial.</p>

<p>If it holds out with sweet-temper it is quite done!</p>

<p>If not, add a scoop of humbleness.</p>

<p>Use self-denial and consideration liberally, and Gentleness will be produced.</p>

<p>Grandpa and the children had been looking at a book of Bible places. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a picture of Jerusalem,&#8221; Alice pointed out. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t the walls have to be built several times?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Grandpa. &#8220;Let me tell you the story of Nehemiah…&#8221;</p>

<h1>How the Wall Was Built</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Nehemiah+2-6">Nehemiah 2-6</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">It had been many years since kings ruled in Jerusalem. After a long time in captivity many of the Israelites had returned again to their beloved city, with its crumbling walls and burnt gates. Among those that now lived there was the family of Benjamin, and we shall call his children Amon and Naomi.</p>

<p>Their house was at the city&#8217;s edge, with a narrow street in front that led to the old tower where the king&#8217;s house had been. Amon and Naomi were always glad when their work was done, because then they could explore along the old wall and find new passages to the fields outside. But Father was troubled. &#8220;We are in danger from our enemies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They say our God has forsaken us because we are poor and the wall is broken down.&#8221; So they prayed for God to send them help.</p>

<p>And God did, for a man came from the palace of Sushan on important business. Amon heard it and told Naomi, &#8220;The men of the city are having a meeting. I wonder what it is about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good news,&#8221; Father said, when he came in. &#8220;God has sent Nehemiah, with aid from the king, that the walls may be rebuilt. Tomorrow we will begin.&#8221; Naomi clapped her hands in excitement, but Amon ran out to look at the wall. It was quite broken down and looked like a lot of work. But Father was cheerful. &#8220;God will help us,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>And it was a lot of work. Amon&#8217;s job was to chisel at the boulders Father brought and Naomi was soon filling an apron with rubble to haul away. Everyone else was working, too. Mother and the other woman cooked for the workers, and none of the children had time to play anymore. But they sang and talked while the hammers clanged and the chisels chipped. Until one day…</p>

<p>&#8220;Our enemies are plotting to attack us in the work.&#8221; The word was passed all along the wall. It was Nehemiah that called them all together. Amon and Naomi watched as he handed out weapons and said, &#8220;Be not afraid, but remember the Lord.&#8221; So, from that day on, half of the men held spears and bows, and even Father had to keep a sword at his side while he worked. Naomi couldn&#8217;t go outside the walls, and even Amon worked with his ears listening for the trumpet warning. But day after day the wall grew taller, and no trouble came.</p>

<p>At last the great day came. The gates had been bolted in and the wall stood high and strong. As Amon and Naomi watched Father clean his tools, they were glad that they had helped. God had given them protection and strength to do this important work: the wall had been built in only fifty-two days. &#8220;The Lord has been good to us,&#8221; Father said. &#8220;We will serve Him and obey His ways.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>


<p>&#8220;Wow!&#8221; said Edward, looking at the book. &#8220;See those rocks and how tall the wall is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God really did help them, didn&#8217;t He?&#8221; Alice added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, for it was done in a very short time,&#8221; said Grandpa. &#8220;The Bible says, &#8216;The people had a mind to work,&#8217; so that helped a lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does that mean that they used their mind?&#8221; Edward was curious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8230;&#8203;&#8221; Grandpa said with a chuckle, &#8220;Not exactly. Having a mind to do something is to set your will and determine to do it. It is your attitude that makes you work hard or get lazy or discouraged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be lazy. I would work hard,&#8221; said Sammy.</p>

<h1>Keeper of the Light</h1>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_15/light_house.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="319" /></div>
<p>Mary&#8217;s father was the keeper of a lighthouse on the coast of England. The light of these lamps shines at night to guide ships on their way and to keep them from dangerous rocks and shoals. The lighthouse seems to say: &#8220;Take care, sailors, for rocks and sands are here. Keep a good lookout and mind how you sail, or you will be lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>One afternoon Mary was in the lighthouse alone. Mary&#8217;s father had trimmed the lamps, and they were ready for lighting when evening came. As he needed to buy some food, he crossed the causeway which led to the land. This causeway was a path over the rocks and sands, which could be used only two or three hours in the day; at other times, the waters rose and covered it. The father intended to hasten home before the tide flowed over the path. Night was coming on, and a storm was rising on the sea. Waves dashed against the rocks, and the wind moaned around the tower.</p>

<p>Mary&#8217;s mother was dead, and although she was alone, her father had told the girl not to be afraid, for he would soon return.</p>

<p>Now there were some rough-looking men behind a rock, who were watching Mary&#8217;s father. They were watching him go the land.</p>

<p>Who were they? They were &#8220;wreckers&#8221; who lurked about the coast. If a vessel was driven on the rocks by a storm, they rushed down&#8212;not to help the sailors, but to rob them, and to plunder the ship.</p>

<p>The wicked men knew that a little girl was left alone in the lighthouse. They planned to keep her father on the shore all night. Ships filled with rich goods were expected to pass the point before morning, and these men knew if the light did not shine, some vessels would wreck upon the rocks. How cruel and wicked they were to seek the death of the ship&#8217;s crew!</p>

<p>Mary&#8217;s father had filled his basket, and prepared to return to the lighthouse. As he drew near the road leading to the causeway, the wreckers rushed from their hiding place and threw him on the ground. They quickly bound his hands and feet with ropes and carried him into a shed, where he had to lie until morning. It was in vain that he shouted for them to set him free; they only mocked his distress. They then left him in the charge of two men, while they ran back to the shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mary, what will you do?&#8221; cried the father as he lay in the shed. &#8220;There will be no one to light the lamps. Ships may be wrecked, and sailors may be lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary looked from a narrow window toward the shore, thinking it was time for her father to return. When the clock in the little room struck six, she knew that the water would soon be over the causeway.</p>

<p>An hour passed. The clock struck seven, and Mary still looked toward the beach; but her father was not to be seen. By the time it was eight, the tide was nearly over the causeway; only bits of rock here and there were above the water. &#8220;O Father, hurry,&#8221; cried Mary, as though her father could hear her. &#8220;Have you forgotten your little girl?&#8221; But the only answer was the noise of the waters as it gave notice of the coming storm. Surely there would be no lights that night.</p>

<p>Mary thought of what her mother used to say: &#8220;We should pray in every time of need.&#8221; Quickly she knelt and prayed for help: &#8220;O Lord, show me what to do, and bless my father, and bring him home safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>The water was now over the causeway. The sun had set more that an hour ago, and, as the moon rose, black storm clouds covered it from sight.</p>

<p>The wreckers walked along the shore, looking for some ship to strike the coast. They hoped that sailors, not seeing the lights, would think they were far at sea.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_15/light_book.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="292" /></div>
<p>At this moment Mary decided she would try to light the lamps. But what could a little girl do? The lamps were far above her reach. She got matches and carried a small stepladder to the spot. After much labor she found that the lamps were still above her head. Then she got a small table and put the stepladder on it. But when she climbed to the top the lights were still beyond her reach. &#8220;If I had a stick,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I would tie a match to it, and then I could set a light to the wicks.&#8221; But no stick was to be found.</p>

<p>The storm was raging with almost hurricane force. The sailors at sea looked along the coast for the light. Where could it be? Had they sailed in the wrong direction? They were lost and knew not which way to steer.</p>

<p>All this time Mary&#8217;s father was praying that God would take care of his child in the dark and lonely lighthouse.</p>

<p>Mary, frightened and lonely, was about to sit down again, when she thought of the old Bible in the room below. But how could she step on that Book? It was God&#8217;s Holy Word that her mother had loved to read. &#8220;Yet, it is to save life,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and if mother were here, would she not allow me to take it?&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_15/light_match.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="292" /></div>
<p>In a minute the large book was brought and placed under the steps, and up she climbed once more. Yes, she was high enough! She touched one wick, then another, and another, until the rays of the lamps shone brightly far above the dark waters.</p>

<p>The father saw the light as he lay in the shed, and thanked God for sending help in the hour of danger. The sailors saw the light, and steered their ships away from the rocks. The wreckers, too, saw the light, and were angry to see that their evil plot had failed.</p>

<p>All that stormy night the lamps cast their rays over the foaming sea; and when the morning came, the father escaped from the shed. Soon he reached the lighthouse and found how his little girl had stood faithful to duty in the dark hours of storm.</p>

<p>How does God comfort us? We feel <i>comfortable</i> when we are safe and happy and well taken care of. Does God give us comfort? How does He do that?</p>

<h1>Let Me Tell You&#8230;&#8203;</h1>

<h2 class="subtitle">How God Was My Comfort</h2>
<p>Once it seemed like everything was going wrong and I just felt like crying. I went away by myself and lay in the grass. I watched the little leaf hoppers and ants and other little creatures God made. Then I thought how big He was that He made all those things and cared about them. I was happy because I knew He could take care of me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve gotten scared before when I thought of people with guns and diseases and what could happen to me. Everything seemed so dangerous. But I prayed and remembered that Jesus was stronger than all those things and He loved me. And since I belonged to Him, I wasn&#8217;t afraid. He would be with me no matter if I died.</p>

<h1>A Soldier on the Devil&#8217;s Night</h1>

<p>The room was dark and cold as the young boy knelt beside the bed. There were tears in his eyes as he prayed, &#8220;Dear Jesus, I need your help today. Please bless Daddy in prison and take care of him. And help Sam, too, and Betsy and Anne.&#8221; A slight sob escaped him as he said haltingly, &#8220;I reckon that Momma is happier up there with you&#8230;&#8203;And forgive Grandma for all that she&#8217;s done.&#8221; Then he said determinedly, &#8220;And Lord, help me do what is right no matter what happens. Amen.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>&#8220;Listen, young man, you are going trick-or-treating, whether you like it or not!&#8221; Bobby&#8217;s grandmother stood before him like an erupting volcano. &#8220;If you give me more trouble about this, you are going to go dressed like the devil, as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was at that moment that Bobby saw the way of escape that the Lord made for him (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+10%3A13">I&nbsp;Corinthians 10:13</a>). &#8220;Grandma,&#8221; he said, in a quiet, respectful voice, &#8220;if I have to go, may I go as a preacher?&#8221;</p>

<p>His grandmother stared at him with a frown. &#8220;All right,&#8221; she said finally.</p>

<p>Bobby spent Halloween morning in his bedroom, and the result was a lot of rolled-up little papers. He placed a small rubber band on each, and put them in his trick-or-treat bag. He was glad Grandmother didn&#8217;t seem to notice them.</p>

<p>Wearing a white shirt and dark trousers, Bobby walked quietly beside his worldly grandmother into the darkness of the devil&#8217;s night. He carried his bag of messages in his hand. In his heart he wanted most of all to let his light shine for Jesus in the midst of that darkness.</p>

<p>All around him were witches and ghosts, movie stars, and weird creatures. Even though the horrible costumes were worn by little children, who did not realize what they were doing, it was still awful. With all his heart, Bobby abhorred that evil and asked Jesus to help him be brave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trick-or-treat!&#8221; the children chanted excitedly as an elderly man opened the door. This really meant that they would play mean tricks on him unless he gave them treats&#8212;the candy. But most of the children did not know this. As the man began dropping candy into their open bags, some of them began to complain that it was not the kind they wanted.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_15/soldier_preacher.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="374" /></div>
<p>Bobby watched from the back of the crowd, and stepped forward when the others left. He didn&#8217;t hold out his bag for candy, but took a little rolled up paper to put in the man&#8217;s hand. The man was surprised at his unselfishness and plain clothes. When Bobby walked away, the man looked after him thoughtfully.</p>

<p>The man opened the little paper. In clear, typed letters it read:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear friend, I do not believe in Halloween. I was forced to go tonight. I believe God is not pleased with this. In the Bible it says: <span class="scripture">&#8216;Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Exodus+22%3A18" title="Exodus 22:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Exodus 22:18)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8216;There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. For all that do these things are an abomination unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+18%3A10-12" title="Deuteronomy 18:10-12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Deuteronomy 18:10-12)</span></a></span> When children do these things, it makes the evil seem not so bad. If you love Jesus, please don&#8217;t celebrate Halloween, for it is the devil&#8217;s night.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Princess,</p>

<p>It was a cool fall day and Mama, Princess Precious and little Joy were glad to step inside the large Goodwill building at the end of their walk from home. Mama went to look for clothes, and after having asked permission, Precious and Joy skipped toward the toy section.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mama, may I buy this baby, please?&#8221; Princess Precious ran breathlessly back toward Mama. Look how pretty she is! And it&#8217;s only $1.89! Oh, <i>please!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Mama took the doll from Precious&#8217; hand and turned it over thoughtfully. &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s on sale&#8212;a blue tag&#8212;50% off today&#8230;&#8203;&#8221;</p>

<p>Precious&#8217; hopes soared. Mama approved of things on sale.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8203;However, she has a cracked toe, plus a broken finger. She&#8217;s dirty, and although she could be cleaned, she&#8217;s made of rather cheap plastic and would tear up soon. I don&#8217;t think you really want this kind of doll, Precious. Even though it&#8217;s cheap, it&#8217;s not worth the money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Self-pity tears filled Precious&#8217; eyes. &#8220;But Mama&#8230;&#8203;I love her, I really do. I don&#8217;t care if she&#8217;s got a broken finger. And I have the money&#8230;&#8203;she&#8217;s on sale&#8230;&#8203;&#8221; Precious&#8217; voice trailed off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember the baby you&#8217;re saving for?&#8221; Mama reminded. &#8220;Remember the beautiful, &#8216;Just Newborn&#8217;? You&#8217;ll soon have enough money to buy her and she&#8217;s much better&#8212;almost like real.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve got to have five whole more dollars and that will take forever!&#8221; Precious whined.</p>

<p>&#8220;It hasn&#8217;t taken you forever to earn twenty,&#8221; Mama replied pleasantly. &#8220;Just a little more work and you will have it.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>You&#8217;re mean,</i> Precious thought under her breath. <i>You don&#8217;t want me to have this one and I should&#8230;&#8203;it&#8217;s on sale&#8230;&#8203;it&#8217;s the one I want and it&#8217;s my money&#8230;.</i></p>

<p>But when Mama said no, the answer was no, so Precious walked grumpily back to the toys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time to go, girls!&#8221; Mama called soon.</p>

<p>Precious jumped back when Mama tried to take her hand. &#8220;I&#8217;m big enough&#8212;not five years old anymore!&#8221; she snapped.</p>

<p>Mama didn&#8217;t say anything, but somehow Precious felt even grumpier than before. She walked along sulkily all the way home. Joy&#8217;s happy chatter made her feel even worse inside. Precious began to think she was a slave&#8212;she could earn money, but she couldn&#8217;t spend it&#8212;at least the way she wanted to. The world was a terrible place and she hated being alive. Precious kicked the dust under her feet, and held back tears until her eyes stung.</p>

<li>Why?</li>

<li>Why do you think Mama said no?</li>

<li>What is going to happen if Precious continues to keep the attitude she has now?</li>
