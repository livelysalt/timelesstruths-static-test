<h1>&#8220;A Friend Loveth at All Times&#8221;</h1>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_7/friend_sleeping.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="172" /></div>
<p>Crickets chirped and the maple leaves rustled in the dark. Rosie lay on her back and looked at the twinkling stars that filled the sky. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad they let us sleep out here,&#8221; she whispered excitedly to cousin Amy, who lay in the sleeping bag next to hers. The cousins had come, and they were having a sleep-out in the backyard. Cousin Ronald, Daniel, and Chad were sleeping on the porch, but the girls had picked a grassy place near the maple tree.</p>

<p>They were all quiet until Amy asked suddenly, &#8220;What is the shortest verse in the Bible?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Irene with importance, &#8220;It says,
<span class="scripture">&#8216;Jesus wept.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+11%3A35" title="John 11:35"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 11:35)</span></a></span>&nbsp;&#8221;
</p>

<p>Rosie rolled over and tried to see her sister and three cousins in the darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Megan. She was only six, a whole year younger than Rosie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because His friend Lazarus had died,&#8221; said her oldest sister, Ruth. &#8220;I read that story in my Bible a few days ago.&#8221; Rosie was still, listening to the crickets. <i>I would be sad if my friend, Alberta, died,</i> she thought. Alberta Jones lived in the old house at the corner and they often played together after school was out. Maybe she would come and play with them tomorrow. Rosie&#8217;s eyes closed, and soon she was asleep.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_7/friend_peeking.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="355" /></div>
<hr class="minor" />
<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; asked Amy after the chores were done the next morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about &#8216;Squirrels in a Tree&#8217;?&#8221; said Ruth. All the girls agreed. Just then Alberta Jones&#8217; head peeked around the corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi!&#8221; said Rosie. &#8220;Want to play?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; agreed Irene. &#8220;We need one more person to have enough anyway.&#8221; Alberta came and they explained how to play. The girls divided into three pairs and the chasing and running began. When everyone was tired and breathless, they sat down and played clapping games.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s take a walk to the river,&#8221; Irene said after awhile. &#8220;We could pick flowers for a pretty bouquet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I need a drink, so I&#8217;ll go ask,&#8221; said Alberta. The girls waited a long time. Finally Ruth went to find her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; Irene asked when Ruth came out alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alberta&#8217;s mom called and said that Alberta has lice,&#8221; said Ruth with a shudder.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with lice?&#8221; Rosie asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re horrible,&#8221; said Amy, and wrinkled her nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;And ugly,&#8221; said Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;They crawl all over your head and bite you,&#8221; said Irene.</p>

<p>&#8220;And they&#8217;re catching!&#8221; squealed Amy. She jumped to her feet. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go some place else and hide.&#8221; They ran around the house and across the backyard.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_7/friend_hiding.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="284" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Over here,&#8221; said Irene, ducking into the bushes behind the chicken house.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Alberta won&#8217;t know where we are,&#8221; said Megan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shhh!&#8221; said Amy. &#8220;Just sit down and be quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want to get lice, do you?&#8221; said Irene. Just then the door slammed and Alberta began to call for them. All the girls were quiet as they watched her look around the house. Finally she went walking down the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;She thinks we&#8217;re at the river,&#8221; Rosie said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s follow her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Ruth, &#8220;don&#8217;t move, anyone.&#8221; They sat under the bushes for a long time. Rosie felt prickly and hot; she was getting tired of hiding. At last the big girls said they could go, and they all went to the house for a drink.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you have a nice walk to the river?&#8221; Mother asked, filling their cups.</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t go,&#8221; said Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t Alberta tell you that you could?&#8221; asked Aunt Jenny. Everyone was quiet.</p>

<p>&#8220;We hid from her,&#8221; Rosie said finally, looking at her shoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, girls!&#8221; Mom said sadly, &#8220;that wasn&#8217;t nice at all. Why did you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She had lice,&#8221; said Amy, &#8220;and we didn&#8217;t want to get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Jenny frowned. &#8220;That is no excuse. I don&#8217;t want to hear about you leaving anyone out. You can still be kind and friendly, just don&#8217;t get your heads too close.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come Rosie,&#8221; said Mom, &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to check your hair since Alberta wore your jacket the other day.&#8221; Rosie looked up quickly. What if she did have lice? What would the other girls think? She held her breath as Mom undid her braids and began combing through her hair. &#8220;Yes, I do believe you&#8217;ve got them, too. We&#8217;ll just have to&#8230;&#8203;&#8221; But now the tears were rolling down Rosie&#8217;s cheeks. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; Mother asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8212;don&#8217;t&#8212;want&#8212;lice,&#8221; Rosie sobbed. &#8220;No one&#8212;will&#8212;play with&#8212;me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Rosie,&#8221; Mom said seriously, &#8220;can you see what it must feel like for Alberta? We need to have compassion for those that have trouble. I want all of you to play together nicely, but you ought to apologize to Alberta first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mama,&#8221; Rosie said in a small voice. She looked up to see cousin Ruth standing nearby with the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&#8212;about being so mean and things,&#8221; Ruth said softly. &#8220;I think we should all tell Alberta we&#8217;re sorry.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_7/friend_brush.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="133" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Amy, with a sniff. Rosie was surprised to see that she had been crying. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been punished for it, &#8217;cause I&#8217;ve got lice, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We all need to have Jesus&#8217; love,&#8221; said Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;And think about how others feel,&#8221; added Irene. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t we just talk about a verse like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Megan said, &#8220;Jesus wept,&#8212;&#8217;cause He was sorry for His friend, too.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Showing Jesus</h1>

<p>In the story, Rosie had trouble being kind to her friend. Has that ever happened to you before? Sometimes it seems very hard to treat others nicely, even if they are your friend. Who are people that you know that are hard to be friendly and kind to? Maybe they look or talk differently than you. Maybe they are mean and don&#8217;t say nice things. Maybe they cough, or sneeze, or have lice, like Alberta. But do you know that Jesus loves every one of them?</p>

<p>What was Jesus like when He lived on this earth? In the Bible we can read about Him healing the sick people. They hobbled, had yucky sores, or looked very strange, but He loved them. Jesus was patient and kind when people asked Him questions. He was never mean or selfish, but was always ready to help people. Jesus wanted the children to come and sit in His lap. What do you think it was like to be around Jesus?</p>

<p>Jesus loves every person and wants to make them new and happy inside. Do you think many people know that? If we belong to Jesus, our job is to show Jesus&#8217; love to people. Even if they can&#8217;t see Jesus now, they can see us. If we say we are following Jesus, but then we pout when Mom tells us to work, is that showing Jesus? Ask Jesus to help you be obedient and cheerful. That is what Jesus would do. Live to be like Jesus.</p>

<p>Many people are sad and don&#8217;t have friends. Can you show them Jesus? When we are kind and helpful, Jesus shows. When we sing and make others glad, we are showing what Jesus is like. When people are hard to like, pray for them. God can give us lots of love for those kind of people. God has love for everyone, so He sent Jesus to save us. Now He sends us to tell others about His love. Will you tell them by showing them Jesus?</p>




<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_7/Good_Seeds_and_Bad_Seeds/index.html">Good Seeds and Bad Seeds</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Good Seeds and Bad Seeds</h1>

<p>As we have been starting our gardens, we have been doing hard work. We dug up the ground and made the soil soft and smooth. We&#8217;ve watered and weeded and watched. But there was something very important that we couldn&#8217;t do. Do you know what it is? It is making the seed grow. Only God does that.</p>

<p>Each seed is a special package that God made to grow into a certain plant. If we plant a tomato seed, what plant will grow? A tomato, of course! If we plant green beans seeds, green bean plants will grow. If we plant marigold seeds, marigolds will grow. But if we plant only vegetables and flowers, why do we have weeds? It is because weed seeds are flying through the air and hiding in the soil. Remember the silver puff-ball that the dandelion makes? Imagine, hundreds of seeds ready to blow into your garden and grow!</p>

<p>Do you know that thoughts are like seeds? If you keep a bad thought inside your head, a bad attitude will come out. At first it seems to be just a little thing, like not answering when mother calls or thinking a mean thought. Soon it is sprouting and growing, and the little seed-thought is now a bad weed.</p>

<p>If you keep a good thought, what will happen then? You will have a happy heart instead. Jesus can help us to have only the good seeds grow. If we have a heart of good soil, He can quickly show us when a little seed-thought is not good. Then we can pull it out right away. When thoughts come, pray to Jesus that you will only have the good ones grow. A helpful thought, a smile, a kind word, a helping hand&#8212;these little things will grow into a day full of happy sunshine!</p>

<p>Only God can make seeds grow, and He is the one that can grow good things in us. If we are playing nicely with little sister or brother, Jesus did that. If we obey quickly, we can thank Jesus for helping us. If your plants of love, kindness, and goodness aren&#8217;t growing, maybe you have forgotten that you need Jesus to make your garden grow!</p>

<h1>Project, recipe, poem, and verse</h1>

<hr />
<h2>What are you doing this Summer?</h2>
<p>What do you want to do when summer comes? When there isn&#8217;t school to do, you want to play all day. Maybe you have a fort to build, a game to try, and projects to work on. Maybe you have friends to see and places to go. But what about making others happy?</p>

<p>We can be selfish with our time, or we can be sunbeams. We can plan ways to serve, or we can just want our own way. What plant grows from each of these seeds? What would Jesus do?</p>

<p>I have fun plans for my summer&#8212;how about you? Plan ways to surprise your family. Is there a job that you can do each day to help? Do it cheerfully and well, and it can be fun. Make your work into a game, like Rosie and Daniel did. When you play, play to make others happy. Each day is a new day to be helpful and kind. Do you know that this will make your days happy, too?</p>

<hr />
<h2>Everyday Seed Soup</h2>
<p>Mix the seeds of Love and Kindness with a cup or two of Patience. Add in Forgiveness and Gentleness and Peace. Sprinkle well with Smiles and Cheerfulness. Dish out often and be sure to stretch it with Prayer if it is running low!</p>

<hr />
<h2>Kind Thoughts</h2>
<p class="verse">Kind thoughts are like seeds,
<br />For out of them grow
<br />Kind words and kind deeds;
<br />But first you must sow
<br />A kind thought, so deep
<br />In your mind and heart,
<br />That nothing can tear
<br />Such a kind thought apart.</p>

<p class="verse">Each seed must be watered,
<br />Or else it will die,
<br />And so must each kind thought,
<br />As each day goes by.
<br />If you water each kind thought
<br />With much love each day,
<br />Kind words and kind deeds
<br />Will blossom your way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess what!&#8221; Sammy cried, running in with the others. &#8220;We caught the biggest fish ever!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s bigger than a shark,&#8221; said Edward, &#8220;and almost pulled me in!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s true,&#8221; said Alice, &#8220;your fish must&#8217;ve stretched. It measured 14 inches, remember?&#8221;</p>

<p>Grandpa chuckled. &#8220;I have some true stories for you,&#8221; he told the children, so they sat down to listen to:</p>

<h1>What Happened to Big Things</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+11%3A1-9%3B+Daniel+4%3A28-34">Genesis 11:1-9; Daniel 4:28-34</a>; the <i>Titanic</i>&#8212;1912.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Since long ago bragging has always been a problem with people. They think they can do things better, have things bigger, and act greater than the way things really are.</p>

<p>Once there was a group of people that decided that they would built a tower that reached up to heaven. They wanted other people to think that they were important. The people began to build their tall tower, and they worked hard. They were very proud and thought that they would be able to do anything they tried, but they forgot something. They forgot that there is a God of heaven that was greater than them. God heard their bragging and confused them so that they couldn&#8217;t understand each other. Then they couldn&#8217;t work together anymore, and their great tower was never finished.</p>

<p>Once there was a king who ruled all the land around him. He built a great city and had a great army that conquered many lands. This king looked at his great kingdom and said to himself, &#8220;See what I have done by my might and power! I am so wonderful and great!&#8221; He did not remember God, who had given him the kingdom, and the power and the might. And so God took it all away from him, and made the king to loose his mind. How strange it is to think, but this great king crawled on his hands and knees and ate grass like a cow for seven years! At last the king humbled himself and thanked God, who does all great things and rules forever and ever. Then God gave him back his kingdom to rule. Do you think he bragged again?</p>

<p>Once, not long ago, there were some men who built a giant ship. They built it long and strong, so that it could cross the ocean. When they were finished, they bragged, &#8220;Not even God can sink this ship!&#8221; Do you think He could? The ship was filled with people who thought it would never sink. It was better and bigger than all the other ships, and it was made to float. So it started proudly across the ocean, filled with fathers, mothers, boys, and girls. Before it reached the other side, it sank to the bottom of the sea and most of the people drowned.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Grandpa, looking around at the children.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because they bragged so much about it,&#8221; said Alice.</p>

<p>&#8220;They thought they were smart,&#8221; said Edward, tipping his head wisely, &#8220;but they weren&#8217;t. I read about it. They didn&#8217;t even watch very much for danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; agreed Grandpa. &#8220;That is just what braggers do. They think they don&#8217;t need to be careful and so they get into trouble. It is always best to look at things the way they really are, even if you aren&#8217;t going to look as good to others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t brag anymore,&#8221; Sammy said solemnly, &#8220;&#8217;cause those people drowned in the ocean. I don&#8217;t want my Daddy or Mommy to drown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes people exaggerate, and that&#8217;s not very good either,&#8221; added Alice.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does &#8217;zaggerate mean?&#8221; asked Sammy.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you exaggerate, you are stretching the truth to make it sound bigger,&#8221; said Grandpa. &#8220;Like saying you ate twenty sandwiches when it was only three. It is better to always say what you really mean. That way, people can always trust what you tell them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And God knows when we tell the truth or not,&#8221; added Edward.</p>

<h1>Joe and His Rose</h1>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_7/joe_flower.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="190" /></div>
<p>Joe and his little sister Bess lived in a little gray cottage on the edge of town. Mother and Father had died, and Grandmother had to work at the dress shop all day, so Joe took care of Bess. He would tidy up the rooms and heat up the breakfast Grandmother had left them. After Bess ate, Joe had to find something to keep her busy or else she would get into mischief. If they finished their chores early, Joe got out the blocks and made towers and villages with her. Sometimes they would read a story or draw pictures, but what Bess liked best was to go outside.</p>

<p>The cottage was small, and so was the yard, but Joe and Grandmother tried to make it pretty. In the spring, they would plant marigolds under the window, and there were bright red tulips and yellow daffodils by the edge of the lawn. Bess loved to pick the flowers and make bouquets for the table. Sometimes she got the stems too long or too short, but Joe didn&#8217;t scold her. She was little; soon she would learn. But Bess didn&#8217;t seem to learn very fast and often got into trouble. Joe was always patient and kind to his little sister. When she tore her dress and got mud on her socks trying to climb the fence, he took her inside to wash up and only said, &#8220;Bess, you&#8217;d better be more careful.&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_7/joe_watering.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="215" /></div>
<p>Now Joe had planted a climbing rose bush by the front gate. The neighbor had given it to him and said it would have beautiful pink flowers in the spring, but that had been two years ago and no roses appeared. Still, Joe was patient and always watered and weeded around the bush first thing in the morning. It stretched taller and twisted far across the fence, but all it grew were leaves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are there no flowers?&#8221; asked Bess, sticking two dirty fingers in her mouth. &#8220;I want flowers for my b&#8217;kay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you pick the marigolds or tulips?&#8221; said Joe as he hoed weeds by the gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;All gone,&#8221; said Bess. And they were.</p>

<p>So Joe told Bess that the rose bush was stubborn and wild. &#8220;We must be patient and tame it,&#8221; he said. Together they dug up rotted leaves in the woodlot and piled them around the bush. Joe pruned the wildest vines, and Bess sloshed a little pail of water over it. And they waited.</p>

<p>One morning after breakfast, Bess disappeared. Joe looked in the house and in the yard, under the bushes and in the woodlot, but she was nowhere to be found. This could have made him very cross, for he had planned on going to the blueberry patch to earn a little money, but he was not. You see, Joe was living for Jesus, and he knew that Jesus would help him if he asked. So Joe prayed, and then went down the street. At each house he stopped and asked about his little sister, but no one had seen her. Finally, by the last house on the street, he saw her climbing in an apple tree. Bess was a sad little girl coming home that morning, for Joe said he must tell Grandmother about her naughtiness.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_7/joe_tree.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="193" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Bess, &#8220;I will be good, &#8217;cept it is always hard to do it.&#8221; Joe thought he should be gruff and scold her more, but he remembered that Jesus was always kind and loving. So he told instead that he would help her, if she would just listen and obey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for maybe there&#8217;s time yet to pick blueberries!&#8221; And so they hurried down the road with their tin pails. They were hot and dusty that afternoon, but they came back with a pail of berries and Joe had two dollars in his pocket.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_7/joe_rose.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="221" /></div>
<p>When they reached the gate, Joe stopped to check his rose bush, for he had forgotten it in his rush that morning. &#8220;Oh, see!&#8221; said he to Bess. &#8220;Come look right away!&#8221; Bess looked and saw it, too&#8212;a beautiful soft rose, just opening up.</p>

<p>&#8220;So pretty,&#8221; she said softly. &#8220;But it took so long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did say we had to be patient, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221; Joe said, and laughed. &#8220;You have been my wild little bush, too, but I think you&#8217;ll grow some roses yet.&#8221; And he gave Bess a little squeeze.</p>

<h1>Love Suffereth Long</h1>

<p>Love <span class="scripture">&#8220;suffereth long&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+13%3A4" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 13:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 13:4)</span></a></span> (bears hard things for a long time). How long? Jesus gave us an example of longsuffering love. He could easily have refused to die on the cross for us. He said that He could have called down angels from heaven to take Him from the cross. Why did He die for us? It was because He had love in His heart for us&#8212;longsuffering love.</p>

<p>When others aren&#8217;t kind to us and hit us or say bad things about us it is hard to love them, isn&#8217;t it? But Jesus calls us to follow Him, to be like Him, to act like He did. People were not kind to Jesus. They said awful things to Him, they spit on Him and laughed at Him. When Jesus was dying on the cross they said that if He was God&#8217;s Son, He should come down from the cross. Even Jesus&#8217; friends all left Him. What did Jesus do? Did He say mean things back? Did He feel sorry for Himself? Did He feel angry? No. Before He died, Jesus prayed to His Father in Heaven,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+23%3A34" title="Luke 23:34"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 23:34)</span></a></span>
He forgave them. Doesn&#8217;t that seem like a very hard thing to do?</p>

<p>Jesus calls us to take up our cross every day and follow Him. What is our cross? It is the things that are very hard to bear. Jesus doesn&#8217;t ask us to do something that is impossible. If we ask Him for help, He will help us to do the hard things. He will help us to forgive others even when it is very hard to. He will help us to have His love that suffers long in our hearts. If we try by ourselves it won&#8217;t work. We must ask Jesus to help us. Jesus says that if we don&#8217;t forgive other people from our hearts, He won&#8217;t forgive us. If we don&#8217;t love others, we aren&#8217;t loving God, because He loves everyone.</p>

<p>All of us are born with black, bad hearts. Everyone, after Adam and Eve, is born with sin in their lives. Everyone except Jesus. We can&#8217;t go to heaven if we have bad hearts. We must be truly sorry for the bad thoughts we have had and all the wrong things we have done. We must ask Jesus to forgive us before we can get to heaven. If we do these things, Jesus has promised to change our hearts and give us clean white ones. He loves us and wants us all to go to be with Him in heaven.</p>

<p>Ask Jesus now for a clean heart. He won&#8217;t turn you away. Jesus wants to clean our hearts up and give us good things. He will give you His peace and happiness which no one can take away. Ask Him now to forgive your sins and give you a clean heart. You will know when He has answered. He will give you so much happiness and joy. Ask Jesus now. He answered me and gave me a clean heart, and I know that He has it for you, too.</p>

<h2>Something You Can Do</h2>
<p>There is something special you can do to make your table pretty and put a smile on your mother&#8217;s face. It only takes a little while, and it is fun.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_7/bouquet_vase.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="252" /></div>
<h1>Make a Bouquet!</h1>

<p>First you need the flowers. Cut big and small ones of whatever colors you like. Cut a lot of flowers to make a big, pretty bouquet.</p>

<p>Take your flowers to a table. Also get a scissors and vase of cool water. For small flowers you can use a short jar or small dish, for taller flowers use a jar, small pitcher, or taller vase.</p>

<p>Set the flower clusters in first and add in the single flowers. Trim the stems when you need to and try to keep a roundish shape to your bouquet. Fill in all the gaps. Make sure that the colors are spread around and the bouquet is pretty on all sides.</p>

<p>Some flowers, like roses, are very beautiful if you lay them in a shallow dish. Cut their stems short and add in small white flowers around them. Leaves or ferns can also be put in.</p>

<p>When your bouquet is finished, set it where you can enjoy God&#8217;s beautiful flowers! (And remember to clean up the mess you made!)</p>

<h3>God Knows Every Single Little Pain</h3>
<p>Now, at lunch time, my neck was hurting. After Joel [thanked the Lord for the food], I did a prayer in my head, and after a little bit, my neck stopped hurting. So God took care of my neck. I&#8217;m so thankful that God can take care of all our needs.</p>

<p>When I was walking down the hall to have my rest time, after lunch, my side started to hurt. So I laid down, and prayed to God that He would make it so it didn&#8217;t hurt. After a little bit, it stopped hurting. I&#8217;m thankful that God knows every little thing.</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Children,</p>

<p>If you loose your sewing or toy, just pray like I did. Here&#8217;s what happened to me: I am sewing a quilt for my doll, Felicity. One night I lost it. I looked and looked. I looked for it everywhere. Then I said, &#8220;How about we pray and ask God to help us find it.&#8221; Abigail (whose house I was at) said yes, that would be a good idea. So we prayed, and when we finished, we found my sewing in [another girl,] Jani Jo&#8217;s, sewing bag. Then we thanked Him for helping us to find my sewing. I was very happy about it!</p>

<h1>A Little Boy&#8217;s ABC Prayer</h1>

<p>The following story is told of a little boy in one of the Eastern States who had been taught all his life to make his requests known to the Lord.</p>

<p>One day while he was walking along a roadside, the wind blew his hat over the fence into the field on the other side. The fence was too high and difficult for the little lad to climb. After a moment, he remembered what his mother had taught him, and decided that he should ask the Lord to get the hat for him.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_7/prayer_praying.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="180" /></div>
<p>He knelt down and bowed his head by the fence corner, and, not knowing what else to say, began praying: &#8220;A, b, c, d, e, f, g,&#8221; etc. When he had finished saying the alphabet once, he began repeating it over again.</p>

<p>A gentleman came by and heard him, so he came up quietly and listened. He wondered why the boy was kneeling there and solemnly saying his ABCs.</p>

<p>At length he said, &#8220;Boy, what are you doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Praying,&#8221; the boy replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you praying about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The wind blew my hat over this high fence into that field, and I can not climb the fence to get it. My mother taught me always to pray and ask the Lord for whatever I needed and told me that He would answer prayer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you were not praying; you were only saying your ABCs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Lord knows how to put them together to make a prayer,&#8221; the boy replied.</p>

<p>The gentleman was so touched at the boy&#8217;s sincerity that he climbed the fence and got the hat for the little lad, who said, &#8220;There, didn&#8217;t I tell you the Lord would answer my prayer?&#8221;</p>

<h1>Johnny&#8217;s Battles</h1>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_7/battles_bully.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="198" /></div>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better leave me alone!&#8221; Johnny Lee did his best to duck away. It didn&#8217;t do any good. Eric was lots bigger and faster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ow! Don&#8217;t! It hurts!&#8221; The bigger boy twisted Johnny&#8217;s arm behind him and savagely pulled his ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t fight, huh.&#8221; Eric gave his twisted arm a yank which brought another cry of pain from Johnny. &#8220;When I tell you to fight, you better fight! Or you&#8217;ll wish you had,&#8221; he continued grimly.</p>

<p>Peter laughed with glee. &#8220;Get him, Eric. He&#8217;s too scared to fight!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Johnny&#8217;s second day at school. Every boy at Mount Everson had to fight a boy every day until he lost. Eric Canterbury said so.</p>

<p>But Johnny knew that Jesus didn&#8217;t want boys to fight. The Bible said to love your enemies, not fight them.</p>

<p>His arm hurt all day. His ear hurt, too. That evening, at home, Johnny couldn&#8217;t split the firewood.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened to your arm, Johnny?&#8221; Mother asked. Dad looked up, too. So Johnny told them about the way the boys did at school.</p>

<p>Dad looked sad. &#8220;Well, Johnny,&#8221; he said, &#8220;let&#8217;s kneel down and pray that Jesus will take care of you.&#8221; He knelt down right in the yard, so Mother and Johnny knelt, too. &#8220;Dear Lord,&#8221; he prayed, &#8220;You said in Your Word that You would fight our battles. We are trusting You to help Johnny at school so he won&#8217;t have to fight. Amen.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Johnny went to school the next morning, Eric said that he would have to fight Peter.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Johnny bravely, &#8220;I won&#8217;t do it. I don&#8217;t have to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eric laughed like a donkey. &#8220;Haw!&#8221; he roared. &#8220;Who&#8217;s going to help you, now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jesus will help me,&#8221; Johnny said.</p>

<p>Eric&#8217;s eyes narrowed. &#8220;Who&#8217;s Jesus?&#8221; he said, scornfully. &#8220;Where is he?&#8221; He started for Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get the little coward, Eric,&#8221; said Peter.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_7/battles_bee.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="252" /></div>
<p>Just then, something happened. Eric let out a yell. He began to hop on one foot while he held the other foot with his hand. He hopped away, still yelling. &#8220;Oh! It hurts!&#8221; he screamed, as he tried to get away. Then, God&#8217;s bumblebee went back to gathering food from the clover.</p>

<p>Peter backed away from Johnny. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t do anything,&#8221; he stammered. Then he ran, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t do anything, either,&#8221; thought Johnny happily. &#8220;Jesus fought my battle for me.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Princess,</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_7/letter_humility.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="334" /></div>
<p>There once was a princess, named Princess Precious. She was very beautiful, because she wore the golden gown of obedience. She tried very carefully to obey everything King Jesus said. In fact, she tried so carefully, and was such a good princess, that she begin to think that she might even be the best princess in the whole, wide world.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_7/letter_pride.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="380" /></div>
<p>She said to one princess, &#8220;Why, look at that dirty hole in your Golden Gown&#8212;I never get mine dirty at all.&#8221; The other princess begin to cry, but Princess Precious just smiled and thought about what a good princess she herself was. (She didn&#8217;t see that a dirty &#8220;unkind-words&#8221; spot had come on her own gown.)</p>

<p>Another princess came by, and Princess Precious said, &#8220;Did you know that I can sing better than you? I will teach you how to sing, but you really have a dreadful voice.&#8221; This princess begin to cry, too, and hung her head.</p>

<p>Now Princess Precious didn&#8217;t feel very good. When she opened up her book of love letters from King Jesus, she read (for she could read quite well):</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">I will be happy with princesses who are kind and humble, and give good gifts to them. Princesses who are not that way, I will not even look at.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Princess Precious thought, &#8220;What does humble mean?&#8221; She found that it meant</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Do not tell others that you are better than them.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Princess Precious felt even worse. She went to the other princesses and told them she was sorry. She asked King Jesus to forgive her, too, and you know what? He did, and gave Princess Precious a big hug and several good gifts, and she was very happy.</p>
