<h1>&#8220;A Friend Loveth at All Times&#8221;</h1>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_7/friend_sleeping.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="172" /></div>
<p>Crickets chirped and the maple leaves rustled in the dark. Rosie lay on her back and looked at the twinkling stars that filled the sky. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad they let us sleep out here,&#8221; she whispered excitedly to cousin Amy, who lay in the sleeping bag next to hers. The cousins had come, and they were having a sleep-out in the backyard. Cousin Ronald, Daniel, and Chad were sleeping on the porch, but the girls had picked a grassy place near the maple tree.</p>

<p>They were all quiet until Amy asked suddenly, &#8220;What is the shortest verse in the Bible?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Irene with importance, &#8220;It says,
<span class="scripture">&#8216;Jesus wept.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+11%3A35" title="John 11:35"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 11:35)</span></a></span>&nbsp;&#8221;
</p>

<p>Rosie rolled over and tried to see her sister and three cousins in the darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Megan. She was only six, a whole year younger than Rosie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because His friend Lazarus had died,&#8221; said her oldest sister, Ruth. &#8220;I read that story in my Bible a few days ago.&#8221; Rosie was still, listening to the crickets. <i>I would be sad if my friend, Alberta, died,</i> she thought. Alberta Jones lived in the old house at the corner and they often played together after school was out. Maybe she would come and play with them tomorrow. Rosie&#8217;s eyes closed, and soon she was asleep.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_7/friend_peeking.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="355" /></div>
<hr class="minor" />
<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; asked Amy after the chores were done the next morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about &#8216;Squirrels in a Tree&#8217;?&#8221; said Ruth. All the girls agreed. Just then Alberta Jones&#8217; head peeked around the corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi!&#8221; said Rosie. &#8220;Want to play?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; agreed Irene. &#8220;We need one more person to have enough anyway.&#8221; Alberta came and they explained how to play. The girls divided into three pairs and the chasing and running began. When everyone was tired and breathless, they sat down and played clapping games.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s take a walk to the river,&#8221; Irene said after awhile. &#8220;We could pick flowers for a pretty bouquet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I need a drink, so I&#8217;ll go ask,&#8221; said Alberta. The girls waited a long time. Finally Ruth went to find her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; Irene asked when Ruth came out alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alberta&#8217;s mom called and said that Alberta has lice,&#8221; said Ruth with a shudder.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with lice?&#8221; Rosie asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re horrible,&#8221; said Amy, and wrinkled her nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;And ugly,&#8221; said Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;They crawl all over your head and bite you,&#8221; said Irene.</p>

<p>&#8220;And they&#8217;re catching!&#8221; squealed Amy. She jumped to her feet. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go some place else and hide.&#8221; They ran around the house and across the backyard.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_7/friend_hiding.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="284" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Over here,&#8221; said Irene, ducking into the bushes behind the chicken house.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Alberta won&#8217;t know where we are,&#8221; said Megan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shhh!&#8221; said Amy. &#8220;Just sit down and be quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want to get lice, do you?&#8221; said Irene. Just then the door slammed and Alberta began to call for them. All the girls were quiet as they watched her look around the house. Finally she went walking down the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;She thinks we&#8217;re at the river,&#8221; Rosie said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s follow her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Ruth, &#8220;don&#8217;t move, anyone.&#8221; They sat under the bushes for a long time. Rosie felt prickly and hot; she was getting tired of hiding. At last the big girls said they could go, and they all went to the house for a drink.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you have a nice walk to the river?&#8221; Mother asked, filling their cups.</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t go,&#8221; said Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t Alberta tell you that you could?&#8221; asked Aunt Jenny. Everyone was quiet.</p>

<p>&#8220;We hid from her,&#8221; Rosie said finally, looking at her shoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, girls!&#8221; Mom said sadly, &#8220;that wasn&#8217;t nice at all. Why did you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She had lice,&#8221; said Amy, &#8220;and we didn&#8217;t want to get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Jenny frowned. &#8220;That is no excuse. I don&#8217;t want to hear about you leaving anyone out. You can still be kind and friendly, just don&#8217;t get your heads too close.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come Rosie,&#8221; said Mom, &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to check your hair since Alberta wore your jacket the other day.&#8221; Rosie looked up quickly. What if she did have lice? What would the other girls think? She held her breath as Mom undid her braids and began combing through her hair. &#8220;Yes, I do believe you&#8217;ve got them, too. We&#8217;ll just have to&#8230;&#8203;&#8221; But now the tears were rolling down Rosie&#8217;s cheeks. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; Mother asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8212;don&#8217;t&#8212;want&#8212;lice,&#8221; Rosie sobbed. &#8220;No one&#8212;will&#8212;play with&#8212;me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Rosie,&#8221; Mom said seriously, &#8220;can you see what it must feel like for Alberta? We need to have compassion for those that have trouble. I want all of you to play together nicely, but you ought to apologize to Alberta first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mama,&#8221; Rosie said in a small voice. She looked up to see cousin Ruth standing nearby with the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&#8212;about being so mean and things,&#8221; Ruth said softly. &#8220;I think we should all tell Alberta we&#8217;re sorry.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_7/friend_brush.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="133" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Amy, with a sniff. Rosie was surprised to see that she had been crying. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been punished for it, &#8217;cause I&#8217;ve got lice, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We all need to have Jesus&#8217; love,&#8221; said Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;And think about how others feel,&#8221; added Irene. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t we just talk about a verse like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Megan said, &#8220;Jesus wept,&#8212;&#8217;cause He was sorry for His friend, too.&#8221;</p>
