<h1>God&#8217;s Will&#8212;It Is the Best!</h1>

<p class="author">Angela LeFevre</p>

<p>Questions filled my mind. How was I going to know what God had for my future? Was I supposed to go to college, or was I supposed to stay home? How was I going to know the answer? Does God really care what I do if it is a good thing and if it is something that I want to do?</p>

<p>I would like to share with you the work God has done in my heart this past year as I have sought the Lord about whether His will for me was to go to college next year or to stay here.</p>

<p>God is so perfect and His answers and the way He works are always so awesome and personal! <span class="scripture">&#8220;As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Samuel+22%3A31" title="II&nbsp;Samuel 22:31"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Samuel 22:31)</span></a></span></p>

<p>In June of 2000 a desire was sparked in me to attend a Bible college that had a ministry training program for young adults. When I first heard about the program I jumped at the idea, because it was different from other colleges seeing that the learning wasn&#8217;t only &#8220;book work,&#8221; but hands on learning and training, also.</p>

<p>I had a couple of friends that attended there and they had everything good to say about it and they came home very dedicated and on fire for the Lord and His work.</p>

<p>My parents seemed interested in the school also and we prayed about it but really didn&#8217;t get a concrete answer. The program started in August and we couldn&#8217;t get a peace about starting so soon. It didn&#8217;t seem like adequate timing to prepare physically as well as spiritually, but we kept praying. We then discovered through some pamphlets that I had acquired that I could also enter the program in the month of January. My parents talked it over and agreed that it seemed like God&#8217;s timing. They told me to call the college and try to get some more information before we made a final answer. I was so excited! This really seemed so right. I was relieved that I finally had an answer! I called the college the next day and after several tries I finally got a hold of the ministry director.</p>

<p>He asked me several questions and I shared my heart with him and asked him about enrolling in January. I&#8217;m afraid that I wasn&#8217;t quite prepared for the answer that he gave to me. &#8220;Well, actually,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we are no longer accepting students in January.&#8221; My heart sank. He went on to explain to me why and encouraged me to wait until next August. He said it would give me time to seek God about if this was what He wanted for me, and it would give me time to prepare my heart and time to save up money.</p>

<p>I got off the phone and had a good cry. I was having a hard time understanding what God was doing. Now I had to wait a whole year! Time passed. The Lord blessed me with several odd jobs and I was keeping pretty busy. I still felt like the Lord would have me to go, it would just have to be in His timing. I would wait and work and trust The Lord to prepare me.</p>

<p>In the meantime my older brother started to attend this college. I was so pleased that we would be there together! This did make it harder to wait though, knowing that he was there and I was here! I struggled with &#8220;letting go&#8221; and being willing to be told no if the Lord didn&#8217;t want me to go. I had many people give me their opinions and tell me how I need to get out there, so I really had to stay focused on the Lord. I can honestly say that I didn&#8217;t do too well at that sometimes!</p>

<p>I hung on to something that a visiting pastor from India told me as we were discussing what I was going to do with my life. I told him I really wasn&#8217;t sure, I just wanted to do what God wanted. He said, &#8220;When God speaks, you will know. There won&#8217;t be any confusion or questions in His answer.&#8221; This was very encouraging to me. I had the confidence that when God did speak I would be <i>sure</i>.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t until a few months ago that my parents began urging me to seek God&#8217;s best for my life and what His answer was for me. They told me that I needed an answer for myself soon and they also desired to know so they would know how to help direct me.</p>

<p>Little did I know that they already had both heard separately from God what I was to do, but really wanted me to hear from God myself.</p>

<p>I had casually been seeking all along, but I was of the opinion that I was supposed to go, so I wasn&#8217;t really seeking an answer, I was just trying to remain open if He said no.</p>

<p><i>So</i>, I started earnestly seeking. After some time, though, it seemed that the more I sought the more discouraged I became. &#8220;Why wasn&#8217;t the Lord answering me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Lord had spoken to me through many scriptures that encouraged me to wait on the Lord, to be still and trust the Lord that He heard my prayers and would answer my prayers in His perfect timing.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Wait on the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+27%3A14" title="Psalm 27:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 27:14)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Be still, and know that I am God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+46%3A10" title="Psalm 46:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 46:10)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+21%3A22" title="Matthew 21:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 21:22)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;For everyone that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+7%3A8" title="Matthew 7:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 7:8)</span></a></span></p>

<p>I was thankful for the encouragement from the scriptures and they really gave me the strength to wait for the Lord&#8217;s answer, but it still was not the answer!</p>

<p>One evening last month I plopped on the couch beside Mom and Dad. I was very discouraged and weary of seeking. I had come to the end of my rope and didn&#8217;t know what else to do. I shared my frustration with Mom and Dad, and as the Lord led they shared their hearts with me. I couldn&#8217;t believe how God worked in my heart at that time. He clearly spoke to my heart that He would have me stay here! It was hard to let go of my dream and desires, but there was such a peace in knowing that God had spoken.</p>

<p>After I shared with them what God had shown me Mom shared with me the next day what God had shown both her and Daddy. The Lord continued to show me things and confirm His answer. He couldn&#8217;t have made it any clearer to me. Our Lord is so awesome! He had the answer for me even before I asked. He knew that I wasn&#8217;t ready to hear His answer, though. I still was holding on to my will. I thought I had let it go, but I was still holding tight. It wasn&#8217;t till I was broken and ready to receive whatever He had for me regardless of whether I liked the answer or not that He spoke. He loved me enough to wait till my heart was ready. Our Lord is so good to us and He loves us so much more than we know. Even when we don&#8217;t receive an answer right away, remember that our Father hears our prayers and is &#8220;working behind the scenes.&#8221; This article is not meant to put down college or future education. God is so big and He has different purposes and plans for each one of His children. My purpose for writing is to encourage each one of you to seek the Lord and find <i>His</i> perfect will for your life. His answers may not always be to our liking but I encourage you to follow His leading even when it is not comfortable. We will experience peace, joy and many blessings when we follow His will for our lives! He has the answers for each one of us and as you seek you will find. I encourage you to find not the &#8220;good&#8221; things God has for you, but rather find His &#8220;best&#8221; for your life. God&#8217;s will is the Best!</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be the glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+3%3A20" title="Ephesians 3:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 3:20)</span></a></span></p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p class="noindent">Dear Readers,</p>

<p>I was blessed by Angie&#8217;s article and having had the privilege to hear her story first hand in phone conversation, I hope she won&#8217;t mind me sharing a little bit more and my thoughts as well. One thing that I was blessed with in hearing Angie&#8217;s story was the absolute commitment to know God&#8217;s will&#8212;even if it took awhile. Over a period of months Angie and I have discussed the possibility of her going to college, talked about the pros and cons. I&#8217;ve prayed for her as I&#8217;ve watched her struggle to find God&#8217;s will, and I can readily testify that this knowledge did not come easily. The path was not clear, and Angie would sway&#8212;she&#8217;d want to go, but also want to do what was only God&#8217;s will. It was not an easy decision. Major decisions should never be arrived at casually, and to find the mind of the Lord, it takes diligent work and a lot of want-to. A whole lot of want-to. But this is so important, my friends! Let&#8217;s ask God to help us to get more earnest about seeking God&#8217;s will for our lives.</p>

<p>An acquaintance once told me that her life was going smoothly&#8212;God just dropped opportunities into her lap&#8212;concerning jobs, education, etc. She didn&#8217;t have to consecrate or wonder what was God&#8217;s will&#8212;everything she wanted just came along. It reminded me of a quote I&#8217;d read: &#8220;The surest, quickest way to hell is the quiet one. No sign posts of danger, just gentle slopes and slightly downward roads leading slowly, but surely to a wretched end.&#8221; Just sliding along, doing what comes our way is not good enough. We can never skate into heaven. It takes seeking, climbing, striving to find what God has and get His best. You may live a shallow life, just slipping and sliding around, not doing anything bad&#8212;many people do that. But if you&#8217;re going to make it to heaven, and accomplish the purpose God put you here for, you will have to do some real work and searching.</p>

<p>It is not the popular thing to do. Many will think you take life too seriously. Many are willing to take what comes and not battle for God&#8217;s way. They&#8217;ll think you strange and proud. They may plead with you to change your mind. In a phone conversation about this topic, Angie shared that some of her friends said, &#8220;Why? We wanted you to come so much! Couldn&#8217;t you just come anyway? It won&#8217;t be bad for you.&#8221; She related that she had replied, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want to take that detour from God&#8217;s will. I want His best&#8212;why would I want to stray from His perfect path for even a day?&#8221; Do you have this commitment? You will need it. What are you? A slipper and slider? Or are you one who is standing on the solid rock, determined only to follow God? Make your choice. It is yours alone.</p>
