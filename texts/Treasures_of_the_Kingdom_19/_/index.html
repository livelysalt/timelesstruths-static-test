<h1>The Wrong Leader</h1>

<p>&#8220;Now Rosie, I want to talk about something before we go in,&#8221; Mother said as she parked in front of the tall gray house. &#8220;Even though Aunt Meg&#8217;s family call themselves Christians, they aren&#8217;t really living for Jesus. That is why Dad and I don&#8217;t let you play with your cousins much. We don&#8217;t want you to be encouraged in the wrong things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I can&#8217;t play with Janice?&#8221; asked Rosie.</p>

<p>&#8220;While I visit with Aunt Meg, you may play together,&#8221; Mama said slowly. &#8220;But I want you to be careful to play how Jesus would want you to, okay?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosie nodded and pushed open the car door. Janice had come over before and it had always been great fun. Nothing would go wrong today, Rosie was sure. She took the steps two at a time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hi,&#8221; Janice said from the open door. &#8220;My friend, Juliann, is over, but you can play with us.&#8221; Excitedly, Rosie followed her cousin&#8217;s bobbing curls up the stairs and into the large, toy-filled bedroom. She hesitated at the door when she saw a dark-haired girl flopped on the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Juliann,&#8221; Janice said. &#8220;Come on in, Rosie, and see what an awesome artist she is.&#8221; Rosie looked at the picture of a flying horse. It did look almost real, except for the wings.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nice,&#8221; Rosie said, joining the others on the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;She can draw cool people, too,&#8221; said Janice. &#8220;Last week she won a prize in our church fair.&#8221; She held up a picture of a curly-haired woman with large earrings. &#8220;That&#8217;s Pastor Will&#8217;s wife.&#8221; Rosie didn&#8217;t think the lady looked very much like someone who loved God, but didn&#8217;t say anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to be a movie artist when I grow up,&#8221; said Juliann. &#8220;Hey Jan, can I see your new movie-star Barbie?&#8221; Janice pulled a shiny box out of the closet.</p>

<p>Rosie didn&#8217;t know what to do. She knew movie stars weren&#8217;t good, but she was curious what one would look like. The doll inside was very pretty, with a tight, sparkling dress that wasn&#8217;t at all modest. Mother wouldn&#8217;t want her to play with something like that. Rosie looked around at the other toys and spotted a pony with flowing hair. &#8220;Do you have more toy horses?&#8221; she asked Janice.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_19/leader_rosie.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="216" /></div>
<p>&#8220;A whole lot of them,&#8221; Janice said, taking several plastic models from her shelf. &#8220;You can play with them. I&#8217;m going to get the whole Hollywood Hero Series soon.&#8221; Rosie fingered the beautiful horses carefully. One was a white mare with her darling colt. Another was a prancing bay stallion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wish I could go to horse camp,&#8221; said Juliann with a long sigh. &#8220;But Dad won&#8217;t let me. Phooey!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could have a horse like this,&#8221; added Janice, holding up a pinto. &#8220;Hey, I have an idea. Let&#8217;s play Mustang Herd!&#8221; Rosie liked the game until Janice started making her horses fight and call each other bad names. Juliann giggled and joined in, but Rosie was quiet. She knew Jesus wouldn&#8217;t want her to play that way, but she didn&#8217;t want to leave. Rosie jumped when she heard cousin Billy&#8217;s voice at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;My Ninja-Turtle wants to play,&#8221; he said, holding a green creature in one hand and a toy gun in the other. &#8220;Hands-up!&#8221; He marched into the room and poked the gun at Juliann, who screamed.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_19/leader_running.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220" /></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Bill the Pill!&#8221; Janice cried. The girls ran shrieking into the hall and Rosie followed, the toy horses piled into her skirt. They had barely escaped into the bathroom and locked the door when Billy was at the door, yelling like a wild Indian.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hide in the bathtub!&#8221; cried Juliann.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a robber!&#8221; said Rosie. &#8220;He&#8217;ll steal the horses!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Toothpaste!&#8221; yelled Janice, grabbing several tubes from a drawer. &#8220;If you dare come in, Bill, we&#8217;ll squirt you!&#8221;</p>

<p>As they sat in the dark tub, suddenly everything grew silent outside, and Rosie could hear her heart pounding. Footsteps were coming up the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Janice, open the door!&#8221; Aunt Meg said. Janice dropped the toothpaste as she tumbled out of the tub.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy was chasing us again, Mom,&#8221; she said, poking her head out the door. &#8220;He&#8217;s just a big pest and always ruins our games!&#8221; She talked loudly so the moms wouldn&#8217;t hear them scrambling to pick up the toys and toothpaste. But Rosie knew Mama would be asking her all about it, and she felt nervous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why were you running away from Billy?&#8221; Mother asked, when they met in the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Rosie said in a small voice. She felt quite ashamed now.</p>

<p>&#8220;He said you were going to squirt him with toothpaste. Is that true?&#8221; Rosie blushed and looked down. &#8220;You must apologize to Billy and Aunt Meg,&#8221; Mother said, after she had heard the story. &#8220;I am very sorry this has happened.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>&#8220;Mama?&#8221; Rosie asked, after they had turned onto the highway toward home. &#8220;Mama, are you mad at me? I was trying to play nicely. I didn&#8217;t mean to get into trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, dear,&#8221; Mother said gently, &#8220;but there is an important lesson to learn from this. In the excitement of playing you didn&#8217;t <i>stop to think</i> about what was the right thing. That is why the Bible says, <span class="scripture">&#8216;evil communications corrupt good manners.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+15%3A33" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 15:33"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 15:33)</span></a></span> Being around bad examples will make us bad, too. That is why we don&#8217;t allow you to play much with them. Do you think Jesus would have played like they did?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Rosie looked down. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t talk very nicely, and it really wasn&#8217;t a good game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you didn&#8217;t want to leave because it was exciting?&#8221; Mama looked at Rosie closely. &#8220;When the devil tempts us with wrong, we must ask Jesus to help us turn away from it. We must hate evil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is hard,&#8221; said Rosie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you must pray for help to do right. When I was a little girl I got into lots of trouble because I followed the wrong crowd. And they said they were Christians, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do they say that?&#8221; asked Rosie. &#8220;Janice talked about church, but it doesn&#8217;t seem like she loves God.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They say it because they want to look good without paying the price,&#8221; Mother said, thoughtfully. &#8220;Just like you wanted to do right <i>and</i> stay with the bad influence. But the two can&#8217;t go together, can they? We must choose one or the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So if we always say what is right, we are a real Christian?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mama smiled. &#8220;God doesn&#8217;t look at what we pretend to be,&#8221; she reminded. &#8220;He looks at what our heart is like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll ask Jesus to help my heart be right,&#8221; said Rosie.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_19/When_to_Run/index.html">When to Run</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>When to Run</h1>

<p>When you play tag, you want to know who&#8217;s &#8220;it,&#8221; so you can keep away from him. If you get caught you&#8217;ll be in trouble: you may get frozen, or maybe be &#8220;it&#8221; yourself. So when &#8220;it&#8221; comes along, you run!</p>

<p>Do you know that there are other things we need to run from? God tells us that sin and wrongdoing will get us into a lot of trouble. Much more trouble than being &#8220;it&#8221; in the tag game! God hates evil because it is like a terrible disease. It will ruin our lives and make us very miserable. The safest place to be is far from evil and close to good. When you see or hear something wrong, it is time to run!</p>

<p>How can we know what is wrong? Anything that you wouldn&#8217;t want Dad or Mom to know is usually the wrong thing to do. If it is disobeying them, or if is a something they wouldn&#8217;t like, <b>don&#8217;t do it</b>. Maybe someone shows you a mystery book they read. Mom never said not to read it, but would she <b>want</b> you to read about thieves and killing? The best test is to ask, &#8220;Would Jesus do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Many things that look okay are really wrong in <b>disguise</b>. Maybe when you are with some friends someone suggests playing &#8220;spy.&#8221; Well, that sounds fun, and before you know it you are sneaking around and running from your mom. The others laugh at a bad story or tell you to &#8220;keep secrets&#8221; which aren&#8217;t good at all. This is called an &#8220;evil influence&#8221; and you will soon end up doing wrong yourself. Better run before it is too late!</p>

<p>Where can we run? &#8220;Right&#8221; is the base, and that is where we are safe. Jesus came to help us know the right way, and to keep us from evil. In a way, wrongdoing is like a big bully that wants to beat us up and we are too small to win. But Jesus has goodness and righteousness, two powers that evil can&#8217;t stand against. The only way to be safe is to ask Jesus for His power to protect us. Then we can keep from evil and stick to the good.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_19/The_Plodding_Turtle_Temperance/index.html">The Plodding Turtle: Temperance</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_19/turtle_log.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="151" /></div>
<p>There is our new animal friend&#8212;see that bump on the log over there? Wait! Let us watch him a little before we get too close. He might jump into the pond if he sees us. This little creature is a cautious fellow, even if he is a little slow. Do you know his name?</p>

<h1>The Plodding Turtle: Temperance</h1>

<p>If we found our friend farther from the water, we might get a closer look at him. At least a closer look at his shell! That is the amazing and special thing about the turtle. No other animal carries such tight armor around on its back. The turtle uses his shell as protection when he is in danger and can&#8217;t run away. He will pull his head and feet inside and just sit still. He can&#8217;t go very fast or very far, or jump or bend, because of that hard shell. But it also means a place of safety whenever there is trouble.</p>

<p>Would it be very easy to live with a shell around you? Let us watch our plodding friend and see. The sun is setting, and he swims to the shore for some supper: a few beetles, some tender leaves, and maybe a berry. If he ate too much maybe the shell would get a bit tight! The turtle doesn&#8217;t seem worried as he carefully picks his way over the stony ground and through some marsh grass. He is not in a rush, nor is he lazy. That is why we call him the plodding turtle. He just keeps going and does what he needs to do: sleep, eat, walk and swim.</p>

<p><i>Temperance</i> means being controlled: not doing too much or too little. It means living carefully. Just like the turtle is controlled by his shell and can&#8217;t do many things, God wants us to obey Him and not run off on our own. What if the turtle thought, &#8220;This shell is a big bother!&#8221; and somehow got it off? What a bad time he would have then! Do you know that many of his bones are attached to his shell? He wouldn&#8217;t even be able to walk without it!</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_19/turtle_water.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="87" /></div>
<p>Just in the same way the Lord designed for us to wear a shell called, &#8220;Trust and obey God.&#8221; We won&#8217;t be able to do things like everyone else, or have everything we want. But it is the safe way for us to live. When we do what is right, we&#8217;re protected from the dangers around us. God will keep us from getting into trouble and living selfishly. <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+3%3A6">Proverbs 3:6</a> tells us this promise: <span class="scripture">&#8220;In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.&#8221;</span> When we have God&#8217;s control on us, we&#8217;ll plod along, doing what is right, knowing that He will take care of us.</p>

<h2>Shells to Study</h2>
<p>God has made many things with a shell or other hard covering. Here are a few to look for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bird eggs</li>

<li>Nuts and Seeds</li>

<li>Crabs</li>

<li>Crawfish</li>

<li>Beetles</li>

</ul>
<p>Can you guess the reason for each of their shells? Think: what would happen if they didn&#8217;t have it?</p>

<h2>On Guard</h2>
<p class="verse">Guard, my child, thy tongue,
<br />That it speak no wrong:
<br />Let no evil word pass o&#8217;er it;
<br />Set the watch of truth before it,
<br />That it speak no wrong;
<br />Guard, my child, thy tongue.</p>

<p class="verse">Guard, my child, thine eyes;
<br />Prying is not wise:
<br />Let them look on what is right;
<br />From all evil turn their sight.
<br />Prying is not wise:
<br />Guard, my child, thine eyes.</p>

<p class="verse">Guard, my child, thine ear;
<br />Wicked words will sear:

<p>&#8220;Hitler was a cruel man,&#8221; Edward said, tossing down his history. &#8220;It is always better to love our enemies, isn&#8217;t it Grandpa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Depends on what enemies you are talking about,&#8221; Grandpa said with a smile. &#8220;Once God needed a hard-handed man to do His work&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Ruthless for Right</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Kings+9-10">II&nbsp;Kings 9-10</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">It was a bloody day when Jehu, the captain of the army, was anointed king of Israel. Trouble and wickedness had filled the land while Ahab, and his son Joram, reigned. The big problem was Queen Jezebel and her idols of Baal. There were priests and temples everywhere and all the worshippers of the true God were being killed off. So God sent a prophet to give Captain Jehu a job. &#8220;I have anointed you king of My people to smite the house of Ahab until none is left,&#8221; He said.</p>

<p>And Jehu wasn&#8217;t slow to get to work. &#8220;Jehu is king!&#8221; his men cried, and off he dashed to Jezreel to overthrow King Joram. The king drove out to meet Jehu and asked, &#8220;Is it peace?&#8221; &#8220;How can it be peace when the land is full of your mother&#8217;s wickedness?&#8221; Jehu answered, and shot him through with an arrow. He rode on to the palace with the nervous guards following.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is on my side?&#8221; Jehu shouted from below the queen&#8217;s window. Several servants came and tossed the wicked Queen Jezebel out, and the prancing horses trampled her to death. As God had said, she was eaten by dogs and there was none to bury her.</p>

<p>But Jehu wasn&#8217;t done yet&#8212;Ahab still had seventy sons living in Samaria. When the lords of the city heard how King Joram had been killed, they were frightened. &#8220;We will do whatever you say,&#8221; they told Jehu. So the seventy sons were beheaded, and Jehu rode to Samaria.</p>

<p>&#8220;If your heart is for the right as mine is, come along,&#8221; he said to Jehonadab, who came out of the city to meet him. Soon not a single person in all the family of Ahab was left. Finally the wicked rule had been broken!</p>

<p>Now Jehu gathered all the people together, for he had a plan. &#8220;We will worship Baal with a great sacrifice,&#8221; he cried, and ordered that every single priest and servant of Baal should come to the house of Baal. &#8220;We want only Baal-worshippers. Search to be sure none of God&#8217;s servants are here,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Perhaps many wondered if they would get in trouble for loving God when they heard what the stern new king said. But how sad for those that were afraid to do right, for Jehu sent soldiers into that wicked house to cut down every idol worshipper with the sword! And so the land was freed from the worship of Baal that day.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The children sat wide-eyed when the story was over. &#8220;Well, do you think Jehu did the right thing?&#8221; Grandpa asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess they were so wicked they just had to be killed,&#8221; Alice said slowly. &#8220;But it didn&#8217;t sound very nice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we suppose to kill all the bad people, too?&#8221; asked Edward, puzzled. &#8220;I thought God wanted us to be kind to everybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God loves everybody,&#8221; said Sammy.</p>

<p>&#8220;He does,&#8221; agreed Grandpa. &#8220;But this story is a lesson to show us how to fight our spiritual enemies, like anger and selfishness, and not let a single one live.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can we fight them? We can&#8217;t chop them down with a sword,&#8221; said Edward.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can determine not to listen to any self-pity or &#8216;poor me&#8217; thoughts. A good sword for that is, <span class="scripture">&#8216;In every thing give thanks.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+5%3A18" title="I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:18)</span></a></span>&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And not to complain or wish we could be like others,&#8221; added Alice. &#8220;I guess there is a lot of fighting to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And sometimes is it hard, like having to share when I don&#8217;t want to,&#8221; said Edward. &#8220;Chopping down my enemies is a big job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But when we fight for the right, God is able to help us win,&#8221; said Grandpa.</p>

<h2>A True Story</h2>
<p>The sun was shining as we sat with our little cousins in the grass, wondering what game we should play. There weren&#8217;t enough &#8220;big kids&#8221; to play Red Rover, and we could only wade in the creek if the moms were watching. But the grown-ups were busy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s swing,&#8221; said my little sister, remembering one of her favorite activities.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_19/lie_eddie.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="158" /></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8212;I don&#8217;t like that swing,&#8221; said my small round-eyed cousin. He was only four and had fallen off once. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to either, huh, Eddie?&#8221; His two-year-old brother only shook his head solemnly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s do <i>something</i>,&#8221; my brother said, impatiently.</p>

<p>I was nine, and the oldest, so of course I was &#8220;boss.&#8221; Plucking a dandelion, I looked around at the big yard, the swing in the tall fir tree, and the old pump house by the pond. &#8220;Then we can play house,&#8221; I said in my most grown-up voice. &#8220;I will be a rich lady and you are the poor people that have to come work for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll live on the porch,&#8221; said little sister. &#8220;Eddie can be my baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be any poor person,&#8221; my brother said stubbornly. &#8220;I won&#8217;t play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can be my guard then.&#8221; I rose and headed off toward the shadows of the tall fir.</p>

<p>&#8220;Okay, I guess.&#8221; And my stalwart companion fell into line.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me, too!&#8221; cried my small cousin, trotting after us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; I said, and waved my arms grandly. &#8220;Here is the castle. Fetch me some stones to make a fireplace. I&#8217;ll need to hunt up a cook right away.&#8221; The boys went about their work rather slowly, but soon we had a fire circle and some old cans to serve for kitchen pots.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can use pinecones for corn,&#8221; my brother suggested, surveying our pine needle carpet. &#8220;There are so many here that we&#8217;ll be really rich!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And grass!&#8221; said his little echo, not wanting to be outdone. He grabbed two fistfuls and added them to our growing storeroom. And so the minutes ticked by happily for awhile. Our poor neighbors were soon at work in the castle, with little sister installed as cook.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s make corn cakes and chicken stew and brown pudding for the feast tomorrow,&#8221; I told the cook. &#8220;And we need the whole palace swept and in tip-top shape,&#8221; I commanded the guards with my fir-branch broom.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; a voice said defiantly. &#8220;I&#8217;m tired of working.&#8221;</p>

<div class="center"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_19/lie_play.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="336" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Dare you disobey the queen&#8217;s orders?&#8221; I cried, and swished at him with my broom. He took to his heels across the dandelions, his round-eyed shadow dancing after him. &#8220;Worthless guards,&#8221; I muttered disgustedly, and turned to my cook. &#8220;You must do the sweeping while I make the feast.&#8221;</p>

<p>The work had hardly commenced when the boys jaunted back again. &#8220;Come, Eddie!&#8221; they called to the little fellow, who had been helping gather cones. &#8220;Come play!&#8221; Soon Eddie and little sister were off in the grass romping around with the boys. That was too much, and I fell in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come back, naughty little servants! I am the queen and you must obey me!&#8221; We were closing in for a jolly pile-up when little Eddie started hopping.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ooo, he&#8217;s stepped in some poo!&#8221; my sister squealed. And there Eddie stood, in his little, dirty bare feet, within easy reach.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not get away now!&#8221; I cried, and scooped him up. Holding his leg I waved the foot in the air and cried, &#8220;You shall get this in your face if you ever try running away from me again!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fresh squeals broke out as they scattered. &#8220;Ooo, ooo! Get away!&#8221; cried my brother as I lumbered after them, the little fellow still in my arms. It was at this awful moment that the unexpected happened: my uncle appeared on the scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daddy! Daddy!&#8221; my small cousin cried, running up to him. &#8220;She&#8217;s going to get poo on me!&#8221;</p>

<p>A dark look swept over his stern face as he turned to me. Frightened, I dropped Eddie&#8217;s leg and plopped him into the grass. He sat, startled for a second, then began to whimper. I stood frozen, wishing I could disappear from sight.</p>

<p>My uncle picked the little fellow up. &#8220;What <i>were</i> you doing with Eddie?&#8221; he asked coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8212;I wasn&#8217;t trying to,&#8221; I said, fumbling for some excuse for my actions, &#8220;wasn&#8217;t going to do&#8212;do anything. He stepped in some poo and I was just picking him up.&#8221; I looked up hopefully, but his dark face didn&#8217;t soften. My heart beat faster as I realized that my cousin would be sure to tell everything. I must somehow convince him I wasn&#8217;t at fault; I did <i>not</i> want to get in trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t going to get it on them,&#8221; I insisted desperately. &#8220;I was only going to help him, and&#8212;and I was holding his leg &#8217;cause I was going to wipe the poo off in the grass.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a long moment of silence as my uncle looked at me sharply. His dark eyes seemed to drill right through my deception. Without a word he turned toward the house, with my little cousins trotting after him.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t long until my aunt and parents were informed and I was in total disgrace. I felt it pressing around at me in their silent and unsmiling faces. First my aunt, then my mother urged me to tell plainly what had happened, but to no avail. I would not disclose that horrid act. In fact, as far as I was concerned, I had never done it. It was a bad dream to forget.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daughter, I must speak with you.&#8221; It was my father this time, and reluctantly I followed him to the bedroom. The bed was wide; I sat on one side, and he sat on the other. I could tell he was very disappointed and displeased with me. The usual smile and warmth had disappeared from his strong face and now the kind eyes were sad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daughter, the others have talked with you already, and your uncle is convinced of what you did. Will you not tell me the truth?&#8221; I began again with my story, hoping somehow that I would be freed from the shame and that he would believe me.</p>

<p>He looked at me searchingly and said very softly, &#8220;That wasn&#8217;t the truth, was it?&#8221; I sat rigidly and didn&#8217;t say anything. Why didn&#8217;t they believe me? Daddy sighed, and lay back on the bed. I watched his face as it wrinkled and his lips pressed together in thought. But I was startled by his next words:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me a story, dear.&#8221; I looked up at him, and saw that he was smiling kindly at me. Me tell a story? That shouldn&#8217;t be hard; I liked telling stories. I put my chin in my hands and thought. It was a castle banquet and naughty servants that swirled in my head. And there had been a lot of work to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was once a rich lady,&#8221; I began. &#8220;And there were poor people that came to work for her in the castle&#8230;.&#8221; Daddy listened without saying a word until I had finished my tale.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was you, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he asked in a low voice. I looked into his strong kind face and the sorrowful look in his eyes went right to my heart. Could I tell him?</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_19/lie_repentance.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="275" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Daddy!&#8221; I burst out, throwing my arms around his neck. &#8220;Oh, Daddy, it is true! It <i>was</i> me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spanked me then and tears ran down his cheeks. The spanking didn&#8217;t hurt nearly as badly as his tears did, for they smote me deep inside. What a horrible thing I had done to make him cry! I couldn&#8217;t imagine anything worse than seeing his big shoulders shake with sobs. At last he held me close and I felt his wet cheek against my forehead, and I knew that he hadn&#8217;t wanted to do it.</p>

<p>&#8220;My child, I love you very much,&#8221; he said in a husky voice. &#8220;But God loves you much more. We <i>must</i> tell the truth&#8230;&#8203;God wants to help us do right.&#8221; He let out a long, heavy sigh and gave me a squeeze. I was a naughty little girl, but safe in his strong, loving arms. Together we bowed our heads to pray.</p>

<p>We left the room together, hand in hand. There were still the others to face with my confession, but now it was all right. There was nothing to hide and I could meet the world with peace inside.</p>

<h2>Something You Can Do</h2>
<p>What can you do with old newspaper? What can you do with the $5 Grandma sent? What is a good way to remember our &#8220;turtle lesson&#8221;? Read on and see! Note: this is a project that can be quite messy, so check with Mom or Dad before you start&#8212;and be sure to clean up! Now you can make a paper mach&eacute;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_19/something_steps_1.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="98" /></div>
<h1>Turtle Shell Bank</h1>

<p>What you will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>a round <b>balloon</b></li>

<li><b>newspaper</b> torn in 1-inch strips</li>

<li><b>flour</b> and <b>water</b> to make paste</li>

<li>poster or craft <b>paints</b> and <b>paint brushes</b></li>

<li>a piece of <b>cardboard</b> and <b>hot-glue gun</b></li>

</ul>
<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_19/something_steps_2.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="120" /></div>
<ol>
<li>First find a place where you can make a mess. Paper mach&eacute; is messy!</li>

<li>Now mix up the paste. Put flour in a bowl and stir in enough water to make it creamy. Use this for dipping the newspapers in.</li>

<li>Blow up the balloon so that is about 10 inches long. Tie it closed. You will make the shell over one side of it.</li>

<li>Begin laying newspaper strips (dipped in paste) side-by-side to cover one side of the balloon. Lay the second layer across these in the other direction.</li>

<li>Keep laying newspaper strips until the shell is five or six layers thick. Try to keep them smooth and make the edges rounded. Clean up your work area when you are done!</li>

<li>Let your turtle shell dry on the balloon until it is stiff.</li>

<li>Now you can pop the balloon and take off the shell. To paint it, find a picture of a painted or pond turtle to copy. Remember to wash out the brushes!</li>

<li>Finish your bank by gluing it to the cardboard. Ask someone to cut the coin slot on top and a flap at one end to take out the money.</li>

</ol>
<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_19/something_steps_3.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="85" /></div>
<p>What to do with your Turtle Shell Bank:</p>

<ul>
<li>put your money in it so that you learn to save and not be a &#8220;spendthrift&#8221;</li>

<li>ask Jesus to help you be a cheerful giver and use your money to help others</li>

<li>learn about what <i>true treasures</i> are (write down answers to prayer and how God has helped you) and start storing up a lot of those!</li>

</ul>

<h1>Cheaters and Ex-Cheaters</h1>

<p>Billy&#8217;s daddy was sitting at the kitchen table. There were papers everywhere and a big adding machine. He had been there all morning.</p>

<p>Billy wanted his dad to put on the big catcher&#8217;s mitt and catch the new curve ball that Billy had learned at school that week. But Daddy just shook his head and sighed every time that Billy asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daddy,&#8221; Billy said, as he whacked his ball into his baseball glove, &#8220;what are you doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m doing taxes,&#8221; his Dad replied. &#8220;The government requires me to pay them a certain amount of money from all the money I get. It takes a while to figure it all out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you have to tell them about all the money?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy&#8217;s Daddy stopped writing on a paper and looked at him. In a very serious, quiet voice, he said, &#8220;Yes, Billy.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was very quiet in the kitchen for a little while. Then Billy&#8217;s Dad began to tell the story of Zaccheus. Billy had always thought of Zaccheus as &#8220;a wee little man.&#8221; In fact, he had rather liked the idea of a man being as short as he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zaccheus was a <i>cheater</i>,&#8221; Daddy said. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t tell the truth. He made people pay more than they should on their taxes. Then he kept the extra money.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_19/cheaters_money.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="132" /></div>
<p>&#8220;I used to be a cheater, too,&#8221; Daddy said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t care if the government got their fair share or not.&#8221; He paused and looked Billy right in the eye. &#8220;Can you guess when I changed?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy knew the answer to that. &#8220;When you got saved,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; Daddy replied. &#8220;Then I had a lot of fixing up to do.&#8221; He stopped for a moment, remembering. Then he continued, &#8220;I met with some men from the government and confessed what I had done. I agreed to a plan to pay the money that I had cheated from the government.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is what Zaccheus did, too,&#8221; Daddy said. &#8220;He told Jesus that if he had taken anything from any man by cheating him, that he would give back four times as much. Also, he gave half of everything that he had to poor folks, who had nothing. Then Jesus said to him, &#8216;This day is salvation come to this house.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy,&#8221; Daddy continued, &#8220;I used to feel really bad about how I cheated the government. I was afraid that policemen would come and take me away. I knew it was not right.</p>

<p>&#8220;But now I feel happy. I do not like paying taxes. It is a hard job. But I feel that the Lord is pleased when I do a good job. I am very glad to be a honest man.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is how Zaccheus felt when he was not Cheater Zaccheus any longer. I expect that he became known as Honest Zaccheus.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Princess,</p>

<p>We serve a true King and His ways are perfect, whether we think so or not. That is what Princess Precious learned one day in the Palace Gardens.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to work with the Gardener today,&#8221; King Jesus had told her. &#8220;Remember to keep your eyes and ears open for Learning Jewels.&#8221; So Precious skipped down the path wearing a new pinafore of Readiness pinned on with the gem of Humility.</p>

<p>The dewdrops sparkled in the sunshine and she stopped to smell a rosebud. &#8220;What are we going to do?&#8221; she asked the Gardener.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_19/letter_pruning.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="247" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Prune roses,&#8221; he replied cheerily. Precious looked at the sharp-looking clippers doubtfully. The Gardener only said, &#8220;Watch now, and I&#8217;ll show you what to do.&#8221; Beginning at a pale yellow rose, he began cutting around it.</p>

<p>Precious was surprised to see big chunks of the lovely bush fall to the ground, along with many of the biggest flowers. It didn&#8217;t seem like the Gardener was being very careful! The poor plant was really having a bad time of it, and Precious determined that she could do a better job.</p>

<p>Turning to a tall red rose, Princess Precious began carefully snipping. She hardly noticed that her gem of Humility was getting quite loose. Two very old flowers and one brown leaf fell from her clippers. Every tall green branch and red rose was left, and she felt quite pleased with herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; said the Gardener, looking over her shoulder. &#8220;That rose bush has gotten quite out of hand!&#8221; And to Precious&#8217; horror he began to cut it nearly to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; cried Precious, with a stomp of her foot. At this her Humility pin flew off into the pile of prunings. Poor Precious tried to hold her pinafore up with a flimsy little pin called &#8220;I&#8217;m Right,&#8221; but the Gardener only looked at her reproachfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little princess,&#8221; he said gravely, &#8220;you&#8217;ve completely lost your Humility and haven&#8217;t gained a single Jewel of Learning. Don&#8217;t you remember what the King told you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Precious frowned. &#8220;You were ruining my lovely bush.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; said the Gardener, &#8220;pruning it was the only way to make the bush good and strong. If I weren&#8217;t so cruel it would have grown weak and fallen over. I believe your <i>self will</i> needed some good pruning this morning, my child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Precious, hanging her head in shame. At that moment she saw her gem glowing faintly among the thorns. Her hands were quite scratched up by the time she got it back, but she was ready for her first Jewel.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not by holding to our own way that we become beautiful,&#8221; said the Gardner, pointing to a little bush bursting with new rosebuds. Precious was surprised to see that great cuts had been made in the branches. Yet the delicate flowers were lovelier than all the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us be like the sparkling dewdrops,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They are only clear drops of water by themselves, but when they let in heaven&#8217;s light they shine with the beauty of the sun!&#8221;</p>

<p>And so, dear princesses let us learn that taking God&#8217;s way is the best way of all.</p>

<p class="signature">With love,<br />Aunt Faith</p>
