<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Princess,</p>

<p>Is work ever tiresome and dull for you? Do you ever find yourself complaining? So did Princess Precious. It wasn&#8217;t that she wanted to be grouchy. Oh, no. But it just crept up on her, and then it became a dreadful habit. When Mother Matron gave her a job to do, she felt it was the hardest one. And then if Princess Carefulness came along, she was sure to have to do it all over.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_30/letter_sweeping.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="155" /></div>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know that I had to sweep behind the trash can, too!&#8221; Precious muttered to herself. &#8220;I think she just wants to give me more work. The other girls went outside a long time ago.&#8221; So she shoved the broom behind the trash can so hard that it tipped over. Now they would make her clean up the trash, too! Precious felt very fretful indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your face looks very sour today,&#8221; Mother Matron said, coming into the room. Precious pressed her lips together. She didn&#8217;t want to say anything, for it was sure to be a complaint. But Mother Matron said, &#8220;Well, what is the problem? Did the broom bite you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just not fair!&#8221; Precious cried, throwing down her broom. &#8220;I can&#8217;t sweep and everyone is saying that I should do a better job!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you can&#8217;t sweep?&#8221; Mother Matron asked with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe the problem is with your shoes, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Precious looked down at her feet quickly. She was wearing her old house slippers, but they didn&#8217;t look that bad. &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she asked with a frown.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that you would find the work was much easier if you were wearing the right shoes. If you&#8217;ll come with me to the store room I&#8217;ll show you.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Precious followed Mother Matron down the hall. When she pushed open a side door, Precious was surprised. She had never seen so many shoes, capes, gowns, and gloves in her life! Mother Matron took down a pair of thick dark shoes from the shelf and handed them to Princess Precious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I have to wear these?&#8221; Precious asked, turning them over. They were heavy, and they didn&#8217;t look too comfortable. On the soles were carved the letters W I L L I N G N E S S.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t have to wear them,&#8221; Mother Matron said quietly. &#8220;But I think you will be surprised how much better they feel than they look. Will you try them?&#8221;</p>

<p>Precious thought she saw a twinkle in the kind eyes. &#8220;Yes, Mother,&#8221; she murmured. Off went the soft slippers and on went the stiff shoes. When Precious stood up, she felt quite tall and grown up. Clop, clop. The shoes thumped as she walked around the room. Just like a little pony.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to try sweeping with these on!&#8221; Precious said with a laugh. As she clopped down the hall, the shoes felt lighter and more comfortable. When she reached the kitchen, she nearly felt like skipping. &#8220;Where is that broom? I must make this room spic and span before Mother Matron gets in here!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has happened?&#8221; Princess Carefulness asked, as Precious flew by her with the trash can.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just going to empty the trash so that the kitchen will be clean!&#8221; Precious said. Then she laughed as Carefulness blinked in surprise. &#8220;It is all because of my Willingness clompers, don&#8217;t you see?&#8221; She lifted her foot to show Carefulness.</p>

<p>&#8220;What beautiful shoes!&#8221; she cried. And they were, all gleaming and bright.</p>
