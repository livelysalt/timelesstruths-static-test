<h1>A Prayer Request and Other News</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Readers,</p>

<p>When we began this publication, we intended to put it out quarterly. It has not worked out that way, and that has often caused some question on readers&#8217; parts as to whether their subscription had expired, or if we were still publishing.</p>

<p>We do continue to have burdens laid on our hearts to write and send out this publication, but find ourselves faced with strong opposition from the enemy of our souls in many ways. Sometimes it is by distraction; sometimes we fight a lethargy, or lack of inspiration; sometimes technical problems. The list goes on, and we are not saying any of this to testify on behalf of the devil. The Lord has surely helped us, and we want to be about His business, but this is a work that faces spiritual opposition. We earnestly desire the prayers of God&#8217;s children to prosper the work in His hands.</p>

<p>On our part, we will contine to purpose to send out issues as often as the Lord inspires and enables us to produce them, but feel that we should give notice not to be alarmed at the irregularity, but rather pray for us.</p>

<p>We will start numbering the issues to make it simpler for you to tell whether you have missed one or not. This is issue Number 6. The first five issues were not numbered, but were <a href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_1/index.html" title="Foundation Truth 1">Winter 2000</a>, <a href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_2/index.html" title="Foundation Truth 2">Spring-Summer 2000</a>, <a href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_3/index.html" title="Foundation Truth 3">Autumn 2000</a>, <a href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_4/index.html" title="Foundation Truth 4">Winter 2001</a>, and <a href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_5/index.html" title="Foundation Truth 5">Spring-Summer 2001</a>.</p>

<p>Another change we are making is in the subscription process. We had intended it as a means of insuring that only those who were interested in receiving the magazine continued to receive it. We recently did some follow-up calling on non-renewers and found many still wanted to receive it. Some felt an obligation to not renew if they couldn&#8217;t send a donation, others simply lost the return card, etc., etc.</p>

<p>We have decided (except in the case of sample copies) to continue to send <i>Foundation Truth</i> indefinitely unless you specify otherwise, and we are going back to some earlier records and putting a number of people back on the list. We will attempt to keep off the list those who specifically requested beaing taken off, but if we make an error, please bear with us, and just notify us one more time if you wish to be taken off.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+3%3A13-14" title="II&nbsp;Peter 3:13-14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 3:13-14)</span></a></span></p>

<p>We desire to do you good. We are only earthen vessels, and any good that you do receive came from the Lord. Our heart echoes with the same spirit that inspired Mary to say, <span class="scripture">&#8220;his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+1%3A50" title="Luke 1:50"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 1:50)</span></a></span> and Paul to say, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+1%3A4" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 1:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 1:4)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Our hearts are full. Our prayer goes out with this issue, that you might receive the help that comes from God. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</p>

<p>&#8212;the Editor &#8220;and company&#8221;</p>

<h1>An Example of Perverseness Towards Human History</h1>

<p>We here quote from a history of the Polynesian people on the island of Tahiti:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Many Polynesian infants never drew a first breath because they were strangled by their parents, usually their fathers, before they could take a first breath. In many respects, though not all, this was the main means of birth control. (Our corresponding one is abortion.) And birth control was even more important to them on their finite little islands&#8212;in an earlier stage of the evolution of their culture&#8212;than ours is now in an overpopulated, finite globe. We are only just beginning to realize the absolute necessity of abortion. You may cringe, as the missionaries did, at what they considered the unspeakable horror of infanticide, but if a fetus is to be curtailed, what really is the difference between three months and nine? Mind you, the importance to the Tahitian of a baby&#8217;s first breath. If the mother wished to and was able to trick the fetus&#8217;s father into going fishing or going into the mountains to fetch the orange-colored plantain, or going to carry a present to his sister on the other side of the island, or whatever, an hour before delivery, so that when he returned the infant was breathing, no power or spirit would make him go through with his obligation to snuff out the life. Because, with the first breath, life had begun, and no social law told him to be a murderer. His duty to society, and also the mother&#8217;s to social survival, was to abort the life before it started. So let that be the first contrast to our mores.</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[Dodd, Edward; <i>The Rape of Tahiti</i>]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>Note the perverse tone of this narrative. It is stubbornly dishonest. It contends that the Polynesian people had to do as they did&#8212;&#8220;the absolute necessity of abortion.&#8221; Here is immorality stifling the conscience by contending that murder is necessary for survival. The same author professes admiration for the &#8220;innocence&#8221; of these individuals, their &#8220;childlikeness,&#8221; etc. He would have us to believe that the people who discovered them and removed their isolation from the rest of the world did them a great disservice. Thus is perpetuated the myth of the &#8220;noble savage,&#8221; violated and ravaged in his primitive purity by the corrupting mores of modern civilization. Thus is preached the doctrine that morality is hypocritical and unnecessary. What a perverse, unbelieving spirit is manifested in all this! Thoroughly dishonest, it picks through the history of man, carefully selecting what few evidences can be twisted into a show of support for its unholy affections.</p>

<p>To get a better idea of what happened on Tahiti, we can read a history of the people of the Hawaiian islands. The author of this work spells out an account of the end of a people who embrace the spirit of adultery and sexual uncleanness:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Women started childbearing in their early teens. Families of twenty children and more were commonplace.</p>

<p>And this propagation was heartily encouraged by chiefs, since the importance of their domains was measured in part by the number of subjects they could claim.</p>

<p>To be sure, little sentiment was expended by parents on their young offspring, and many of them never survived. Family ties were loose, principally because few mothers could ever be quite sure who had fathered a child. &#8220;For husbands to interchange wives and for wives to interchange husbands,&#8221; explained historian Sheldon Dibble, &#8220;was a common act of friendship, and persons who would not do this were not considered on good terms of sociability&#8230;. When a solicitation is made, they seem to imagine&#8230;&#8203;that to comply is generous, liberal and social, and to refuse is reproachful and niggardly. From this confused state of things&#8230;&#8203;it will be understood at once that there could be little or no attachment in the various domestic relations.&#8221;</p>

<p>Children came easily and regularly, and there were so many of them that they were seldom kept together as brothers and sisters. They were freely exchanged or given away like other possessions, so that many children never knew who their real parents were, and the parents themselves lost track. Deformed, sluggish, or ill-tempered babies were unceremoniously put out of the way; others were neglected; sickly ones were placed out of sight and sound where their cries would not be disturbing, and allowed to languish and waste away.</p>

<p>In an amoral society, there was no one to condemn either abortion or infanticide. Both were accepted without qualms of conscience. Still the survival rate of the young at least balanced the death rate of adults.</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[Lee, W. Storrs; <i>The Islands</i>]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>What we are reading about is the disintegration of the family unit entirely through unrestrained licentiousness and promiscuity. The spirit of perverseness contends that this is &#8220;natural&#8221; and &#8220;wholesome.&#8221; It was not. The same author paints us a picture of what it was like to live in such a society:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">&#8220;As you are passing the outskirts of some city or village,&#8221; dramatized historian Dibble, &#8220;you behold a wretched woman carrying something to a secluded spot. You observe her as she stops, lays down her burden and digs a pit in the earth. Ah! What is that she is about to bury? Her own smiling infant. The child perhaps is sick and troubles her&#8230;. She stifles its cries for a moment with her hand, thrusts it into the grave prepared, covers it with a little earth and tramples it down while struggling yet in the agonies of death.</p>

<p>&#8220;But wait and look around a little,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;and you will find that this is not the first grave she has dug. Perhaps this may be the fifth or the seventh child she has disposed of in the same way, and for many of them perhaps for no better motives than to rid herself of trouble or to leave herself more free for sensual pleasure and vicious indulgence.&#8221;</p>

<p>A missionary wife accidentally discovered that her own serving girl, Pali, and the young brother who always accompanied her were the sole survivors of a family of ten children. The other eight had all been buried alive, and the brother lived only because Pali had followed her mother to the burial place and promptly disinterred him.</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[<i>The Islands</i>]</span></p>

<p>Here is a true picture of sin. Conscience seared and any sense of responsibility trampled. The vulnerability of the innocent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">We also need to understand sin in its true color: deforming, defiling, breaking of the righteous law, affronting an awful majesty, profaning a sovereign crown by casting it to the ground. We need to see sin as sin is. But to do this we must be under the influence and inspiration of the Holy Spirit. It is only then that sin appears exceedingly sinful. Even if saved people get too far out from under the influence of the Holy Spirit, sin will not look as bad to them as it actually is.</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[Wilson, Ostis B.; <i>The Nature of Sin</i>]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>
The Bible speaks of the hardening effect of the deceitfulness of sin (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+3%3A13">Hebrews 3:13</a>).
It tells us that the wicked human heart is wicked above all things to the extent that it is impossible for man to know himself and the full effect of his sinful behavior, except as he is reproved by the Holy Spirit (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+17%3A9%3B+John+16%3A7-8">Jeremiah 17:9; John 16:7-8</a>).
Except the Lord dealt with each of us, we would have no chance at all; we would not know sin as sin truly is. But, when God has dealt with us, and a certain amount of light has been cast on our condition, the question is then what we will do with what we are convicted of. Will we humble and acknowledge and seek for help, or will we resist conviction and make excuses? This latter course will lead to perverseness. It actually results in men attempting to bend truth to suit their inclinations.</p>

<p>These truths cast light on the heart condition of Mr. Edward Dodd, the Tahitian historian quoted at the beginning of this article. Mr. Dodd is not appalled at the gross immorality practiced by the Polynesian people. One senses that he thinks it is &#8220;natural,&#8221; even &#8220;healthy.&#8221; He has walked down this path of perverseness long enough that it has deceived him into thinking that the murder of the innocent is &#8220;absolute necessity.&#8221; This conclusion flies in the face of all truth. It would cast down such truths as,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+6%3A31" title="Luke 6:31"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 6:31)</span></a></span>
Mr. Dodd was able to write his perverse thinking because someone spared his life when he was helpless and took care of him when he was innocent and vulnerable. In thus debasing human life by claiming the right to snuff it out at will, Mr. Dodd devalues his own life. He makes a mockery of all that is decent and honorable. Jesus tells us,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+16%3A26" title="Matthew 16:26"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 16:26)</span></a></span>
but this perverse Mr. Dodd would put us on the level of the beasts: &#8220;It&#8217;s time to cull the (human) herd; it is inconvenient to have so many children running about.&#8221;</p>

<p>One does not even have to be saved or love the Lord to see the folly of this deception. A little honesty, a little attentiveness to the conscience, a little discernment of the results of sin in the history of men are more than enough to convict the mind of any serious thinker. We will quote again from W. Storrs Lee, the historian of the Hawaiian people:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Yet Hawaiians were perishing en masse before the march of civilization. Actually they had been indulging in an orgy of self-destruction long before the influx of disease-carrying foreigners, so great an orgy that only a phenomenal birth rate could account for anything like a &#8220;teeming population.&#8221; For them life was cheap, and death held no fears. They could afford to live recklessly and kill recklessly. The carnage of their pitched battles taxed credulity; the scale of their wars was Homeric.</p>

<p>Nearly a century after the coming of the white men, acres of battlefields, like Diamond Head Crater on Oahu and Keei on Hawaii, still glistened with bleached skeletons of slain warriors. And these bones represented only a fraction of the total casualties. Victorious armies relentlessly sought out the families and supporters of the vanquished enemy to prolong the slaughter over periods of weeks and months. &#8220;When discovered, they are cruelly massacred on the spot,&#8221; lamented William Ellis, &#8220;or brought down to the king and chiefs&#8230;&#8203;to die perhaps, to live perhaps.&#8221; John Young testified in his old age that he had seen thousands massacred in the wars of extermination.</p>

<p>The mortality from interisland and intertribal clashes alone would have prostrated a less resilient and less prolific people. And between wars the demand of priests for human sacrifices and the enforcement of capital punishment for violation of taboos constituted a steady drain on the population. Temple kahunas possessed a powerful incentive for the enforcement of taboos, for violators all made acceptable candidates for sacrifice on the altars of the gods.</p>

<p>&#8220;The restrictions of the chiefs and priests were like the poisoned tooth of a reptile,&#8221; observed the dispassionate young adventurer Francis Olmsted. &#8220;If the shadow of a common man fell upon a chief, it was death; if he put on a mantle or malo of a chief, it was death; if he went upon the house of a chief, it was death. If a man was found standing on those occasions when he should prostrate himself, viz., when the King&#8217;s bathing water or his tapa or his malo, were carried along, it was death. So, too, if he continued standing at the mention of the king&#8217;s name in song, it was death&#8230;. If he was irreligious, he suffered death; if he indulged in connubial pleasure on a taboo day, he paid the same penalty; if he made a noise while prayers were saying, he met a like fate. If a woman ate pork, cocoanuts, bananas, a certain kind of fish, or lobster, it was death. So, too, was it death to be found in a canoe on a taboo day.&#8221; Added to these were a great many other causes of premature death, like participation in too dangerous and chancy sports, settlement of private feuds, addiction to awa drinking, accidents at sea and in the high mountains, not to mention the occasional depopulation of whole villages by tidal waves and lava flows. Flirting with death was a favorite Hawaiian occupation.</p>

<p>Yet, despite this rampant slaughter, in the years before the intrusion of foreigners, the throngs of growing youth always seemed to keep pace with the death toll. Women started childbearing in their early teens. Families of twenty children and more were commonplace.</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[Lee, W. Storrs; <i>The Islands</i>]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>With the coming of men from America and Europe, a judgment came upon this promiscuous people&#8212;the scourge of venereal disease was loosed upon the population. The same visitation that restrained men and women in other parts of the world came to the islands.</p>

<p>Under influence of the killer, what little family adhesiveness once existed deteriorated further. The incentive for bringing up large families was lost. Raising children was not worth the struggle. They were expensive in labor and taxes, an extravagance, a burden, an encumbrance. Infants became the unwanted. The rate of conception was unchanged, but the number of surviving children was shockingly reduced. Where there had once been families of twenty sons and daughters, two were more than enough.</p>

<p>Puzzled by the small size of family groups, William Ellis pried into the reasons for it on his extensive tour of Hawaii. He concluded:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">We have long known that the Sandwich Islanders practiced infanticide, but had no idea of its extent until we made various inquiries. It prevails throughout all the islands, and, with the exception of the higher class of chiefs, is, as far as we could learn, practiced by all ranks of people. However numerous the children among the lower orders, parents seldom rear more than two or three, and many spare only one; all the others are destroyed sometimes shortly after birth, generally during the first year of their age&#8230;. It is painful to think of the numbers thus murdered.</p>

<p>Missionaries commonly agreed that at least two-thirds of the children had perished at the hands of parents. Fathers and mothers unconcernedly admitted their complicity, giving as reasons the trouble of bringing them up, the handicap of roving about with young ones in tow, the annoyance of their crying, the bother of feeding them, deformities and trying illnesses of one sort or another. In fits of jealousy mothers killed the favorite child of their husbands, and in retributive fits, husbands killed the wife&#8217;s favorite. They suffocated them, strangled them, beat them to death, dashed them on stones, but most frequently buried them alive.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Some paradise on earth, wasn&#8217;t it? In spite of all that the spirit of perverseness might claim, the truth of the matter is that
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+14%3A34" title="Proverbs 14:34"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 14:34)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>The ultimate effect of the sin of these people was destruction:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">By 1900 their total population&#8230;&#8203;was down to less than thirty thousand, one-tenth of what it had been before foreigners inflicted upon the Islanders their diseases, their western worries, their monetary values, their horses and cattle, their standards of civilized living.</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[<i>Ibid.</i>]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>This was an awful fact, though by no means unusual in the history of man.
Sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ecclesiastes+8%3A11">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>),
but
every transgression receives, in time, a just recompense (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+2%3A2">Hebrews 2:2</a>).
A large part of the history of mankind is the sinning and the reaping.</p>

<p>What do you suppose is the attitude of the spirit of perverseness toward such a disaster of such unconcealed proportions? A little humbling, perhaps? Some degree of abashment?</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">There had to be a popular scapegoat to carry the blame for such decimation, and the handiest one was the body of missionaries, nonmedical and medical. By insisting on dressing the natives in holokus and cotton pants, by helping to destroy their dance and sports, by discouraging bathing in the nude, by tampering with the superior diet of fish and poi, by introducing them to culture and letters that completely changed their manner of living, the missionaries undoubtedly contributed to the physical decline of the natives. But if the merchants and traders had been given a free hand, without missionary intervention, the Hawaiians most certainly would have been virtually annihilated. The few that remained in 1900 owed their lives to pompous Hiram Bingham and his colleagues.</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[<i>Ibid.</i>]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>It&#8217;s the missionaries&#8217; fault that the natives have come to disaster! What a lot of truth and fact this conclusion would ignore!</p>

<p>Late in the century clusters of journalists without too many chips on their shoulders&#8212;men like Richard Henry Dana and Mark Twain&#8212;weighed the arguments and went on record unequivocally in favor of the missionaries. But no affirmation counted for more than that of worldly John Young, who knew the kingdom intimately both before and after the arrival of the New England apostles. He avowed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Whereas it has been represented by many persons that the labors of the missionaries in these Islands are attended with evil and disadvantages to the people, I hereby most cheerfully give my testimony to the contrary&#8230;. I am persuaded that nothing but Christianity could preserve the people from total extinction.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>It seems that God Himself has so fixed matters that those who are determined to be perverse will always find an interpretation which will support them in their perverseness.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+3%3A19" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 3:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 3:19)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Perverseness, like all sin, never recovers itself, never finds a place to say, &#8220;This is enough&#8212;I will go no further.&#8221;</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;When they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+1%3A21-25" title="Romans 1:21-25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 1:21-25)</span></a></span>

<h1>Acknowledgment</h1>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to <b>the acknowledging of the truth</b> ; And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A24-26" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 2:24-26"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 2:24-26)</span></a></span></p>

<p>I am thinking of the largeness and significance of <i>acknowledgment</i> in our dealings with God and with truth. God is still God and truth is still truth, whether we acknowledge them or not; but we do not get anywhere until we <i>acknowledge</i> and <i>confess</i> that we must face Him
<span class="scripture">&#8220;with whom we have to do.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A13" title="Hebrews 4:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 4:13)</span></a></span>
We may refuse to come to this point, even to the extent of denying what is right all of our lives, but <b>in the end, we will all acknowledge; we will all confess.</b> 
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+14%3A11%2C12" title="Romans 14:11,12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 14:11,12)</span></a></span>
It should be plain to all who read these words: <b>all men</b> who have ever lived, are living, or will live <b>shall bow, shall confess</b> to God.</p>

<p>Since we shall all acknowledge God and truth in the end, then the question is: will we acknowledge what is right now, before the final judgment? There is no progress or deliverance without this.</p>

<p><b>Acknowledgment of truth</b> is the first and vital step to getting help. This truth runs contrary to the philosophy of influence, which glories in the skill of easing people into a better condition. The way of the cross is the way of acknowledgment&#8212;it is a stark confrontation. The awful price paid by Jesus speaks in tones of thunder of the enormous need of the human heart. The very first steps toward godly sorrow, confession, and repentance all arise from acknowledgment. God is right and I am wrong.</p>

<p class="verse">By God&#8217;s Word at last my sin I learned;<br />Then I trembled at the law I&#8217;d spurned,<br />Till my guilty soul imploring turned<br /><i>To Calvary.</i><a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/At_Calvary/index.html" title="At Calvary">*</a></p>

<p>This is all the language of <i>acknowledgment.</i> It is to own up, to confess, to admit, to concede. It is the result of humbling. It is honesty and candor in action.
It gets God&#8217;s attention (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+66%3A2">Isaiah 66:2</a>).
</p>

<p><i>Acknowledgment</i> is the first step toward any real help. In the writing of Brother Paul to Brother Timothy (quoted at the beginning of this article), it is plain that the abstinence from striving, the gentleness, the aptness to teach, the patience, and the meekness are all directed to one objective. What is that? That those who oppose themselves might <b>acknowledge the truth.</b> Without this step realized, all the labor expended toward the needy will do them no good.</p>

<p>A certain individual was a poor money manager, had difficulty keeping a job, and suffered from different shortcomings in getting along with people. Different ones were moved with pity and assisted this person a great deal, some giving money, others gave other kinds of assistance, including emotional support and comfort. A great deal of water was poured into a hole, so to speak, (and it was good water), but that was the end of it. No lasting good was done. There was no real effective change in the individual&#8217;s outlook or motivation. The needs were real; the case was indeed pitiful, but there was no change for the better. Part of this was the fault of those who ministered to the needy soul. The help was not tied to incentives which would have had the effect of causing an acknowledgment or a series of acknowledgments on the part of the needy one which would have resulted in real help.</p>

<p>We are fooling ourselves if we think that anyone can make real progress without this serious step of acknowledgment. In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Samuel+11">II&nbsp;Samuel 11</a>, we read of King David&#8217;s temptation and falling into adultery. This is terrible enough, but the account then details the coverup, the murder, and the awful hypocrisy. We began to get a hint of how far things can go if one does wrong and does not acknowledge, confess, and repent.
The man actually feels righteous indignation at the unjust incident related by the prophet, Nathan (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Samuel+12">II&nbsp;Samuel 12</a>). 
Then the covers are pulled off of King David, and God exposes the whole thing. We began to see the thing as God saw it all along. David had
<span class="scripture">&#8220;despised the commandment of the Lord.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Samuel+12%3A9" title="II&nbsp;Samuel 12:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Samuel 12:9)</span></a></span>
By this series of sins, he had despised God Himself (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Samuel+12%3A10">II&nbsp;Samuel 12:10</a>).
And finally, in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Samuel+12%3A13">II&nbsp;Samuel 12:13</a>, David <b>acknowledges and confesses</b> his condition, uttering (as one brother puts it) three of the most dreadful words in human language&#8212;&#8220;I have sinned.&#8221; At this point, King David begins to get help. Finally, he can begin to feel godly sorrow. Finally, he can begin to repent. <i>Acknowledgment</i> opens the door to these things. A lack of <i>acknowledgment</i> keeps it firmly closed. Regret and remorse follow true confession. You can read about it in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+51">Psalm 51</a>.</p>

<p>It required considerable courage and faithfulness on the part of Brother Nathan to confront King David in this way, and other children of God have suffered much hardship to be faithful to God and the one in the wrong in similar situations; but <b>it is the only way</b> in which real help can be obtained.</p>

<p>There must be a certain clarity of understanding on the part of the one in the wrong before there can be a clear acknowledgment. If this is ignored or rushed, then confusion will certainly be the result, and perhaps a certain amount of coercion. Consider the situation of Job and his &#8220;friends.&#8221; They were sure that he had sinned, yet he was unaware of anything between him and God. Consequently, their counsel to acknowledge and repent (while technically accurate) was confusing. Had he yielded to their entreaties, it would have not brought blessings and peace, but bondage and turmoil.</p>

<p>Sincerity demands a clear inner acknowledgment. If apologies become political ploys, then those participating are well on the path to feigned love. After awhile, everything will become a show. The &#8220;courage of your convictions&#8221; will be lost in a morass of conflicting &#8220;duties,&#8221; &#8220;considerations,&#8221; etc. After a while, you will find yourself the servant of men, instead of the servant of Christ.</p>

<p>There is a transparency to an open, honest acknowledgment. Something about it rings well.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+1%3A47" title="John 1:47"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 1:47)</span></a></span>
That is what the Lord said to Nathanael. And, sure enough, that brother&#8217;s reply:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Whence knowest thou me?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+1%3A48" title="John 1:48"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 1:48)</span></a></span>
It is blunt and straightforward. Excuse me, but how do you know anything about me? Such blunt, rugged honesty is vital to receiving the things of God. It also inspires confidence. One is not left to guessing at double meanings. There is &#8220;no guile.&#8221; This simplicity and straightforwardness is the natural result of a plain and aboveboard habit of acknowledgment of truth. I expect that we would say of Brother Nathanael, &#8220;You always knew where you stood with him.&#8221; You were not concerned that he would prove treacherous and stab you in the back. If he opposed you, he would do so openly.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And I saw as it were a <b>sea of glass mingled with fire:</b> and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, <b>stand on the sea of glass,</b> having the harps of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+5%3A2" title="Revelation 5:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 5:2)</span></a></span>
If an individual will approach God with a straightforward, honest attitude, without excuses, with an open confession, then God will deal with that person with the fire of His Word and Spirit, revealing and searching the hidden motives of the heart.</p>

<p>Human wisdom and influence may stir loyalty to people, doctrine, or cause; but it will not bring them to regeneration.</p>

<p>A person&#8217;s honesty is not enough to save them, but ones honesty coupled with the
<span class="scripture">&#8220;piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and [the discerning] of the thoughts and intents of the heart,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A12" title="Hebrews 4:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 4:12)</span></a></span>
will produce <b>a sea-of-glass-mingled-with-fire foundation.</b> This clearness is so important.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, <b>what clearing of yourselves&#8230;.</b> &#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+7%3A11" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 7:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 7:11)</span></a></span>
It will bring about restitution. It will produce an excellent spirit.</p>

<p>Here is where the political mind can go astray. Some are gifted with a good sense of the manifold subtleties of human nature and thought. They have a good feel for the in&#8217;s and out&#8217;s of people&#8217;s ways. We say that they are &#8220;natural&#8221; politicians. Excellency of speech and excellency of wisdom seem very effective and appropriate ways to deal with others. They are naturally influential. We need to recognize that the politically skillful ways of men do not produce this all-important spiritual clearness through acknowledgment.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And I, brethren, when I came to you, <b>came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom,</b> declaring unto you the testimony of God&#8230;. And my speech and my preaching <b>was not with enticing words of man&#8217;s wisdom,</b> but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: <b>That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</b> &#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+2%3A1%2C4%2C5" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 2:1,4,5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 2:1,4,5)</span></a></span>
Men are not fooled or coaxed into conversion. Human wisdom and influence may stir their loyalty to people, doctrine, or cause; but it will not bring them to regeneration. It may teach them to imitate a true Christian, but it will not make a true Christian from the inside out. It will not place the feet on a transparent foundation, even that of acknowledgment, confession, repentance, and deliverance&#8212;a sea of glass mingled with Divine fire. How many dear, precious souls are standing in the wisdom of men! A terrible shock awaits them at the final judgment.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+7%3A22%2C23" title="Matthew 7:22,23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 7:22,23)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>We frequently meet and have dealings with dear souls who are far from acknowledging their spiritual condition, much less getting any deliverance. We observe with horror how their spiritual leaders &#8220;pet&#8221; them and assist them in quieting their consciences.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+6%3A14" title="Jeremiah 6:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jeremiah 6:14)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>A certain acquaintance of ours professed to be a child of God, and we believe that she was really convinced that she was. She had no real victory, and her life was up and down, with no abiding peace. She largely lived on her emotions, but her integrity was sometimes there and sometimes not, as well. But the folks where she went to meeting received her, and they &#8220;encouraged&#8221; her to continue in her profession because she had not embraced a life of open sin and had &#8220;some desire&#8221; to still want to do right. I would toGod that they would have been as zealous in encouraging her to acknowledge her transgressions and confront her need. But human wisdom and the &#8220;spirit of influence&#8221; made them afraid to grit their teeth and deal with her effectively. Besides, the same &#8220;fuzziness&#8221; was working in their lives, and the clearness necessary in their own souls to effectively deal with her was lacking. At one point, this individual did an astounding thing. She sinned greatly, throwing away a great deal of mercy from the Lord extended to her, and wronging others, bringing reproach and hindering others by her actions as she continued to profess. But there was no acknowledgment, not to herself, nor to others. But what she did was so wrong, that her own outraged conscience smote her greatly, and she became deeply depressed and withdrew from everyone, claiming that she was &#8220;discouraged.&#8221; Of course she was discouraged&#8212;she had sinned and made occasion for the enemies of the right to blaspheme. It was time to <i>acknowledge</i> her condition. Her supporters came running. She needed encouragement, they said. This was no time to say anything that would crush her down, they thought. After awhile, they got her pumped up. She felt better. It was all smoothed over. She went another direction and put her hand to other things. No attempt was made to make things right with the ones that she had wronged. She ignored them and avoided them. (No, they were not us. But we marvel at how effectively this dear soul can push aside her responsibility to them. And we marvel at how her spiritual counselors seem to de-emphasize her need to make things right with those folks, as well.)</p>

<p>Such an experience does not stand on a sea of glass in the least, nor does such a dear soul sound forth the praises of God in tune with heaven and the children of God there. Something is badly amiss. A clearness, the clearness of honest acknowledgment and confession, is simply not there. It is time to cry. It is time to drop the false profession (recognizing it for what it is) and cry for help.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+4%3A9%2C10" title="James 4:9,10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 4:9,10)</span></a></span>

<h1>Under the Water Tank</h1>

<div class="blurb">
<p class="first">Jonah once tried to run away from the Lord by taking a ship for Tarshish instead of going to Nineveh to deliver a message from the Lord to the people of that city. But he found it a very difficult matter to flee from the presence of the Lord, as the Lord was upon the sea the same as upon the land. The Lord caused the sea to become boisterous, and Jonah was cast overboard, and, in a miraculous way, was brought to the shore, where he was again reminded of his duty to go and deliver the message to the people of Nineveh. Since that time there have been many Jonahs&#8212;many people who have received messages from the Lord to go and deliver, or leadings to give of their means to the work of the Lord, and who, instead of being obedient, have tried to turn a deaf ear or to flee from the presence of the Lord, only to meet with reverses and difficulties.</p>

<p>The following incident in the experience of a brother, A. C. Bennett, who was called to preach the gospel, has often been related by him in detail to public audiences. Only a brief account is given here.</p>

</div>


<hr class="minor" />
<p>In my childhood days my home was in the backwoods, where there was but little chance to obtain an education. When the Lord called me to the ministry, I could scarcely read and my hearing was defective.</p>

<p>When I heard the word of God preached, it sent conviction to my soul, and I yielded to the wooings of the Spirit, and He saved my soul and helped me to learn to read. As I learned to read the promises in His Word, I was made to know that they were for me as well as for others. For twenty-three years it had been very difficult for me to hear on account of the affliction of my ears, but the Lord healed me, for which I give Him all the praise.</p>

<p>After I began my work as a minister, I had many interesting experiences, one of which I desire to relate for the glory of God and the benefit of others.</p>

<p>On the 4th of July, 1901, I landed at Keystone, South Dakota, with the blessings of God upon my soul. On account of the drought in Missouri where I had been living, I contracted debts that I was unable to pay when due. The next day after my arrival, I began to work in the timber and remained there in the Black Hills until April 1902. The Lord blessed my labor and helped me to meet all my obligations. We then went to the plains and began working on a ranch for a cattleman. On going to South Dakota I left my family in Missouri, but sent for them about a month later. My work on the ranch was irrigating hay-land, branding cattle, etc., and my wife did the cooking for the workmen.</p>

<p>One day a Baptist minister came and asked me if I was a Christian. I told him that I was.</p>

<p>&#8220;What church do you represent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The church of God,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>I told him that we believed in preaching and practicing all the Word of God. He invited me to attend his Sunday-school and be free to teach what the Bible says, as he said the Sunday-school was for that purpose. He further said, &#8220;If you have more of the Bible than we have, you are the man we want.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the following Sunday we went to that place, and after Sunday-school the superintendent asked me if I ever preached. I told him that I had preached a few times, and he invited me to preach the following afternoon. I accepted the invitation, and God blessed the effort put forth in preaching the Word to the good of the people, and from that time we had services every two weeks the remainder of the summer. The people seemed to be very much interested and came for twenty-five miles to hear the Word of God. The cowboys would hang their spurs and revolvers on their saddle-horns and come in and listen with amazement to the preaching, while tears coursed down their cheeks.</p>

<p>One Sunday afternoon, after listening to a gospel message under the anointing of Holy Spirit, some of them came and requested me to preach this gospel in their neighborhood. I told them that I did not have time to do so, as I had hired to a Mr. Cox and believed in being a good servant.</p>

<p>On our way home my wife told me how bad she felt when I told those men that I could not go and preach for them. She said she believed the time had come that God wanted us to get out of that place and preach the gospel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, wife,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;you are homesick. You may go home on a visit, and I will stay here and hold my good job down, and when you get your visit out, you can come back.&#8221; We went on with our work as usual until the next Sunday, when my wife said to me, &#8220;I want to read you some of the Word of God,&#8221; and she read from Ephesians 6:5-7:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters, according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; not with eye service as men pleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+6%3A5-7" title="Ephesians 6:5-7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 6:5-7)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, which are you going to do from the heart, obey God, or man?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, wife, you are homesick. If you want to go home, you can go, and I will not object.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not me but you that God is after,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>But I kept repeating, &#8220;You are homesick. I have the best job I have ever had in my life and making money the easiest.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not wish to give up my good job. I had ten good horses, a new, $45 saddle, two new spurs, and a lariat rope, and everything necessary to eat.</p>

<p>My wife said to me: &#8220;You are not as spiritual as you once were. God wants us to flee out of here as Lot did out of Sodom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again my reply to her was, &#8220;You are homesick.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rejoined, &#8220;If you do not get out of here, something will happen to you or to the children or to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day I went to haul water in a water-tank with a four-horse team. The tank held six thousand pounds of water. After hauling one load and putting it in the cistern, I went back after the second load. While I was coming down the breaks of the Cheyenne River, the front wheel of the wagon dropped into a ditch, and the tank turned bottom side up and caught me under it. I tried to jump, but my brake rope, which was across my lap and was fastened at both ends, caught me and doubled me up. The tank fell across my back, leaving my head and feet outside.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="../../Foundation_Truth_6/watertank.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="450" /></div>
<p>When this happened, the first thing I thought of was what my wife had told me the day before&#8212;&#8220;If we do not get out of here, something will happen to you or to the children or to me.&#8221; I saw that God had me fast so that He could talk to me, and I began to call upon Him for mercy. I had told those men I did not have time to preach the gospel to them, but God said, &#8220;It is preach the gospel now or lose your soul,&#8221; and I saw that to rebel meant destruction. I was now ready to listen to God. The relish for my good job had fled away as fog before the morning sun.</p>

<p>My little children who were with me came rushing to me, crying, &#8220;Oh, Papa! Papa! What shall we do?&#8221; I told Minnie to go and tell her mama. The house as a mile away from where the accident happened. The child ran all the way and told her mother, who said, &#8220;I knew something would happen.&#8221; She came to my rescue, and upon her arrival I saw the very same look on her face that I saw the day before when she told me that she knew something would happen.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will obey God now, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, wife, and I ask your forgiveness for not taking your admonition yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was helpless, only being able to move my tongue and right hand. I had been asking God to spare my life until I could ask my wife&#8217;s forgiveness, having already asked God to forgive me; and when I did that and promised God to obey Him, it seemed that Jesus and a host of angels hovered around the tank to deliver me.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to imagine my condition while there with a 6,000-pound tank on my back, and my head between my feet. I was then ready to say yes to God. I wish to say by way of warning to others, that if God is calling you to His service, or to help His cause with your means, you had better say yes to His will.</p>

<p>My wife took a new inch rope, doubled it, and pulled the wagon off the top of the tank; then she hitched the team of horses to the tank to remove it from me. It was a square tank made of two-inch planking and full of water. I had a steady team of 1400-pounds weight. The tank had to be rolled up hill. My wife spoke to the horses, and they took a steady pull, lifting the tank perhaps ten inches, when the rope broke, letting the tank drop on me again. She then discovered a heavy log-chain, which we had not noticed before, and fastened it to the tank and rolled it off me, telling me to get up, but I could not move. She then came around the wagon and pulled me away from the tank, and I fainted, and for a time it seemed that my life had fled away. My wife got some water, washed my face, and offered up a prayer to God, and He came to my rescue again. About this time one of the cowboys came and saw what had taken place, and at my wife&#8217;s request, he went to procure a wagon and a featherbed and laid me in the wagon and took me home. On the way we met another cowboy, who went back with us and helped carry me into the house. My wife wrote a request to the Trumpet office, which was then at Moundsville, West Virginia, asking for prayer in my behalf.</p>

<p>Mr. Cox, the man for whom we were working, came in and looked at me and suggested that we send for a doctor, as he said blood-poisoning would set in and kill me. I told him that we had no need for doctors or medicine, as we trusted in God. He then went out and told my wife that I was out of my head and did not know what I was talking about, and that mortification would set in and kill me. But she told him that I knew what I was talking about, and said, &#8220;We will trust God.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night the cowboys did not want to go to bed. They said, &#8220;He will die before morning,&#8221; but my wife told them to go to bed and said that she would take care of me and that if she needed help she would call them. They were very good to us and willing to do anything that they could for my comfort. The next morning Mr. Cox came to our room and asked how I was getting along. I told him I was feeling as well as could be expected under the circumstances.</p>

<p>The next day the news began to spread among those to whom I had preached divine healing, and when they came to see me, they would ask me what I was going to do, and would tell me that my back was broken and that I could never walk again. I told them that whether I lived or died, I would trust God to the last. It took two men to turn me on a sheet, and, like Job&#8217;s comforters, they gave me no help or encouragement in my trusting God.</p>

<p>This continued for about a week. I did not know which way the tide would go with me, but it was all submitted to God. I promised God while upon my bed that if He would raise me up I would spend the rest of my days preaching the gospel, even if I had to live on bread and water. After about a week, while I was lying on my bed talking with God, we received The Gospel Trumpet; and in looking over its pages, I saw the testimony, with eight names signed to it, of a sister who had been raised from the dead by the mighty power of God.</p>

<p>I said to my wife: &#8220;I am not dead yet, and if God can raise that sister from the dead He can heal me, and I am now ready to be healed. Your request for prayer has just about had time to reach the office at Moundsville.&#8221;</p>

<p>We then called the children and prayed, and our faith took hold upon the promises of God, and He healed me. I turned myself, got out of bed, stood upon my feet, and, in the name of Jesus, I began to walk. My limbs began to tingle as if pierced by a thousand needles, and from that day until this I have been walking. Whether or not my back was broken, I do not know, but I can say as did
the blind man (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+9%3A25">John 9:25</a>),
that, whereas I could not turn myself in bed, I now walk. All glory to His precious name!
He is the same yesterday, today, and forever (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+13%3A8">Hebrews 13:8</a>).
</p>

<p>But the tempter was not through with me yet. Mr. Cox offered me every inducement to get me to stay and work for him, but my wife said, &#8220;We will not stay here for all his possessions.&#8221;</p>

<p>So we left there, and from that time until now, we have been going forth, preaching the everlasting gospel, earnestly contending for the faith once delivered to the saints.</p>

<h2><a href="../../../texts/Only_a_Servant/index.html" title="Only a Servant">Only a Servant</a></h2>
<p>Kristina Roy</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Just when farmer Ondrasik needed help most and had no idea where to find someone, there came to his house a man, uninvited and unexpected.</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[Roy, Kristina; <a href="../../../texts/Only_a_Servant/index.html"><i>Only a Servant</i></a>, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Only_a_Servant/The_New_Servant/index.html">The New Servant</a>&#8221;]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>Thus begins a story of a young man who was &#8220;only a servant.&#8221; Who was he, anyway? Why was he always doing good things for everybody? Why, he even took a kind interest in old David, the Jew, who lived in a little hut against the fence of a neighbor&#8217;s property. In the two years that this young man lives in the community, he lives such a life and bears such an influence that the women say, &#8220;Everyone who has aught to do with the servant of Ondrasik is being changed.&#8221;</p>

<p>This story of a servant of Christ on a mission is wholesome, inspiring reading for the whole family. It is a story of the power of God, shining through the life of one of his humble children.</p>

<p>A book about the moral collapse of the American family which includes a historical perspective of the family in western civilization. It examines the roles of the welfare system, homosexuality, and divorce in America.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Almost every reader of this book has either been divorced or knows a family member or friend who has been divorced. And yet almost every reader of this book over the age of fifty can also remember a time when divorce was not only rare but was regarded as a catastrophic event.</p>

<p>This author deplores the effects of divorce all around us, and he asks the most important question, &#8220;How do we extricate ourselves?&#8221; We would to God that everyone was asking this question and was deeply concerned about the prevalence of this sin. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+4%3A26" title="Proverbs 4:26"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 4:26)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+1%3A5" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 1:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 1:5)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Brother Paul is speaking to Timothy here in preparation for an exhortation to boldness and courage. The foundation he builds on is &#8220;the unfeigned faith&#8221; which he saw in Timothy. If that wasn&#8217;t there, then being exhorted to boldness and courage would be useless! Unfeigned means simply that it is real and sincere. As I look around in the scriptures, I see that this faith is laid as a foundation. 
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+11%3A6" title="Hebrews 11:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 11:6)</span></a></span>

</p>

<p>Now if this is indeed the key to both starting and finishing the race for heaven, and if there is indeed a war for men&#8217;s destinies waged between God and the devil, then it becomes apparent that this very thing is hotly disputed ground. It is in the devil&#8217;s interest to obscure themeaning of it, lead people away from it, convince people who have it that they don&#8217;t, and convince those that don&#8217;t have it that they do. Basically, the devil will use any strategy and tactic that men use in human warfare to prevent us from obtaining and maintaining this faith (without any regard for &#8220;fairness&#8221; or &#8220;honor,&#8221; for the devil does not limit himself in that way at all). Indeed, our only hope to &#8220;gain this ground,&#8221; is the determination to get from God the help needed no matter what it takes. And this very thing God is most willing to do. My prayer is that the remaining thoughts here might be useful in God&#8217;s hands to send help to some who need it in this area.</p>

<p>In its simplest sense, faith is believing something to be so. But how do we know if we actually believe something to be so? In the play &#8220;Fiddler on the Roof,&#8221; a scene occurs where Tevye, the lead character, is listening to two people arguing. First, he says to the one, &#8220;You know, you&#8217;re right!&#8221; The other speaks, contradicting the first, and Tevye says to him in turn, &#8220;You know, you&#8217;re right!&#8221; Then the first speaker, with some frustration, says: &#8220;I&#8217;m right! He&#8217;s right! How can we both be right?&#8221; To which, Tevye, after pondering a moment, replies: &#8220;You know, you&#8217;re right!&#8221; Faith is a persuasion. It believes when the opposition has had its say, as well. It is not faith when it simply holds to what has most recently been stated.</p>

<p>Faith is also something that demonstrates itself in action. In the late 1800&#8217;s, in a small town, the story is told of a noted infidel there, who stated again and again, in (apparently) convincing terms that there was no God. One day his wagon overturned on a lonely road, pinning him underneath it. He was conscious, but trapped, with no likely prospect of help. Another man came by after some time, and heard, from under this wagon, the sound of loud, earnest prayer to God for help. The infidel&#8217;s faith that there was no God was not strong enough to demonstrate itself in this crisis! It becomes evident that it was rather a preference than a conviction.</p>

<p>Faith is based on knowledge and experience, although it reaches beyond it. A famous daredevil tightrope walker had arranged to walk a tightrope across the Niagara river, just above Niagara Falls. Before crossing, he spoke to the crowd, asking them if they believed he could do it. They responded that they did. He &#8220;worked&#8221; them thus a little bit, until they were wildly cheering that they believed, not only that he could do it, but that he could carry someone across on his shoulders. Then he asked for a volunteer to ride across on his shoulders. Dead silence. Finally, his agent volunteered (with some trepidation), and was taken across safely. The agent had some experience with this man, but had to reach beyond it, placing his safety in his hands.</p>

<p>We see these elements in the passage in Hebrews, and in several &#8220;pieces.&#8221; We first must believe God exists, then we must believe He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. Developing such a faith can perhaps start from seeing others rewarded, but must finally extend to becoming a diligent seeker ourselves. This diligent seeking must press through the obstacles, exercising and becoming stronger until it stands ready to pay the great price. What great price? Consider this: 
<span class="scripture">&#8220;&#8230;&#8203;and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+10%3A9" title="Romans 10:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 10:9)</span></a></span>
The death we must believe Jesus was raised from was needful because of us. Death to our pride, death to our self-sufficiency, death to our sense of being &#8220;ok&#8221; and endeavoring to manage on our own. The life to which Jesus was raised is as King and Lord of all. Submission to a new master, with all things in subjection to Him. Faith resulting in action, extending beyond experience, standing without outer props. Faith that pursues until the reward is obtained&#8212;the new heart, sins forgiven and all things made new.</p>

<p>My prayer for you is that you would, by the help of God, maintain this &#8220;unfeigned faith&#8221; if you have it, and recognize if you do not have it and seek until you obtain.</p>

<h1>The Pilot&#8217;s Voice: Part 4</h1>

<p class="author">Isabel C. Byrum</p>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">Byron had been caught. It was all out. From the morning that he stood before the judge, Byron knew life was going to be different. But how different he had yet to discover.</p>
</div>


<hr class="minor" />
<p>Byron was still clinging to a part of the wreckage of his past life. Though home now was his shelter and Mother&#8217;s prayers a source of comfort, Byron was often troubled.</p>

<p>While letting the horses rest one afternoon, Byron sat down with a jack-knife to whittle. He soon was buried in deep thoughts about his past. Like a book, he seemed to be able read every page. How many times he had not listened to his mother&#8217;s advice! It was the little things which had grown into ugly mountains, for each sin had led to a greater one. </p>

<p>Byron shuddered at the awful pages. &#8220;How could I have been so blind? Just look at the result of my disobedience and lying. The trouble with the boys was just where I was heading!&#8221; He felt himself sinking as a guilty sinner in the ocean of sin, unable to get out on his own. </p>

<p>&#8220;Have mercy upon me, O Lord,&#8221; Byron prayed, dropping to his knees in distress. He was in trouble, but the Savior seemed so far away! </p>

<p>Sitting on the porch that night, Byron felt quite miserable. Mother came to sit beside him, but he could hardly tell her the trouble. At last she said, &#8220;There is to be a series of meetings held by a traveling minister starting Sunday. I should like to have you go with me.&#8221; </p>

<p>They talked then, and darkness fell as Byron told her of his burdened heart. Once again he found her to be such a loving and understanding mother. He went up to bed with eager thoughts about attending the meetings.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>The singing had begun when Byron and his mother entered the chapel. He sat and watched the happy faces of the little band as they sang:</p>

<p class="verse">Salvation&#8217;s free, glad joy to all<br />Of Adam&#8217;s fallen race;<br />We&#8217;ll tell to all, both far and near,<br />Of saving, keeping grace.<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/A_Song_of_Joy/index.html" title="A Song of Joy">*</a></p>

<p>How the words thrilled Byron&#8217;s soul! The sermon, too, was the wonderful story of Christ&#8217;s ministry on earth. The minister spoke of His simple life as a beautiful example of God&#8217;s undying love. And this Jesus had called to the weary to come and find rest for their souls. Byron longed for that.</p>

<p>As they sat in the meetings that week, Byron felt the burden of his sins more keenly. Night by night the plan of salvation was becoming more and more clear to him. He longed for this freedom more than he had ever wanted the fun times with the boys. The sermon on repentance was deep and heart searching. When a kind and touching invitation was given to come forward for prayer, Byron hastened to the front. </p>

<p>&#8220;God alone can save you,&#8221; the minister said, &#8220;and godly sorrow is to be pained because you have violated God&#8217;s holy law. You must call upon Him to help you forsake all your sins. God commands you to repent, for there is no other way to be saved.&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;Do you willingly promise that you will do anything that God may require of you?&#8221; the minister asked. &#8220;He simply asks you to make your wrongs right wherever you can. To be forgiven you must also forgive those that have wronged you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done all that,&#8221; Byron said. &#8220;What more can I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you must have faith,&#8221; the minister said very earnestly. &#8220;Can you not believe that the Savior&#8217;s great sacrifice was for your sin, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do believe,&#8221; Byron said a moment later, and the calm and happy look on his face showed plainly that a change had taken place.</p>

<p>When Byron returned to his home he knew that his old life was all gone forever. In family devotions the Bible truth seemed strangely new and interesting to him. As he worked in the field he joined in the bird songs. Byron enjoyed more true happiness out there in the field alone with nature and his God than he had ever been able to imagine before. And his precious mother no longer looked so care-worn and tired.</p>

<p>On the last day of the meetings, a baptismal service was held at the river. One by one the candidates followed their Savior&#8217;s example and were buried in a watery grave. As Byron entered the river there was a peaceful smile upon his face. How different this scene was from the dark night when he went over the footbridge not so long ago! </p>

<p>A glad and happy Byron returned to the farm duties with a desire to do all for the Lord. From Mother he learned the beautiful secret: we cannot please God perfectly unless we willingly and cheerfully do the little trying things of each day. And Byron did his best.</p>

<p>Often he would steal away to some secluded spot to pray. At times he was assailed by the enemy and he would go to his mother for needed help and advice. God&#8217;s Word became daily food to Byron, and he enjoyed pondering on it alone or studying it with the family.</p>

<p>In all this Byron found the source of happiness and peace. There were two days that never caused him trouble any more: yesterday and tomorrow. Yesterday was gone and what had been done he could never undo. All the troubles of it were past, and could not come back again. Byron could leave it all with God.</p>

<p>Tomorrow was also far beyond reach. Whatever he did would not make it closer. If it held sorrows or sunshine, they also must be left with God. Today, then, was Byron&#8217;s only day. What he could do must be done now, for he might not be alive tomorrow. So he decided to give his best and be faithful, trusting his all-wise Creator to take care of all the rest.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>It was good that he did, for one day something quite unexpected came along. A relative had come to visit them from a distance, and one afternoon Byron came in to find him in serious conversation with Mother. &#8220;We have been talking about your future, Byron,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I would like to have you return with me and enter my place of business. What do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to go very much!&#8221; Byron said, brightly. But looking at the tear-stained face of his mother, he added, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I can, for Mother needs me at home. And, and&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you don&#8217;t think I can give you up?&#8221; Mother finished. Her eyes were loving, but yielded, and she said, &#8220;I am willing. Yes, it will be hard, but I trust the Holy Spirit to be your guide and this good man to be your friend and counselor. I am glad you should be able to develop into a useful Christian man and be a blessing to the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night when they were alone together, Byron said, &#8220;Tell me, Mother, all that will help me through trials and temptations. I don&#8217;t want to get off on the wrong track.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Mother began to speak of the many dangers and snares that he should guard against. &#8220;A drunkard is not made in a moment,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You must shun the first drink to escape the second. The weak in character won&#8217;t be able to bear ridicule, as you found in associating with James. And how many lives have been ruined by strong drink!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Also don&#8217;t be hasty in choosing friends. Be assured that he is an honorable person. We all have our faults, but associate with those that have a good and upright effect.&#8221; </p>

<p>When at last Byron said good-night, he kissed his mother gently and said, &#8220;God bless you! I will strive to do my best and listen for my Pilot&#8217;s Voice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Over the next few days they were extremely busy getting ready. Clothes were bought and things packed carefully by loving hands. &#8220;As I have done before, I shall often bow again in prayer for you,&#8221; Mother said, as he sat by her chair the last time. &#8220;I hope you will improve every opportunity for learning things that will be useful and helpful to you later on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad literature, I believe, is one of the worst influences to do wrong. &#8216;Satan finds mischief for idle hands to do&#8217; is just as true of idle minds,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;But biographies of good men and stories told of travels are safe to read. And though you enjoy all your learning, keep your Bible as the most important.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will seek to please God more than anything else, you do not need a set of rules saying what you should or shouldn&#8217;t do. You will be safe if you always look to your Pilot to guide you. He will warn you of danger and the snares the devil sets.&#8221; </p>

<p>Byron thought of the many warnings he had ignored, and knew she was right. Now he wanted most of all to take the Bible as his chart and listen to that Pilot&#8217;s voice. He wanted to live up to the expectation of his mother, to be a servant of that noble and glorious King. But how hard it was to part! </p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Mother, goodbye,&#8221; Byron said tearfully, as he stepped into the carriage. Then they were off, with the home and all things dear left behind. The future now lay before with all its uncertainties. </p>

<p>As they waited at the train station, Byron&#8217;s thoughts were interrupted by the voice of his companion. &#8220;I hope you don&#8217;t regret coming with me,&#8221; he said kindly. &#8220;Remember that success does not come in a moment, and it will take a lot of courage and a decision to make the best of what comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am determined to do my best to win,&#8221; Byron said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may succeed financially, Byron,&#8221; the man continued, &#8220;but don&#8217;t forget the good instruction of your mother. Be always on your guard, for the enemy is sly and always works to trip us up. If you will pray and seek your Pilot&#8217;s help at all times, He will help you through every storm.&#8221;</p>

<p>So it was that Byron set forth on a new adventure in life. He spent most of his spare time now in study, particularly in his Bible. Life in the city was quite different from the farm, but Byron determined to do his best and soon adjusted. Others noticed his faithful efforts in the little things, and soon he was given more important work to do. He learned to take each trial and test to the Lord and find His strength and help to go on.</p>

<p>The weeks and months sped by, and at the end of the first year he was able to go home to visit. It was good to talk with Mother once more, to see the farm and friends, and be in the family circle at morning worship. It seemed his mother&#8217;s prayers had followed him all the way, and he left with them echoing in his ears once more.</p>

<p>Resuming his work in the city, Byron was soon helping the business grow as it had never before. He worked with good will and prospered, and no one could help noticing the faithful young man in the office chair. Time sped along and soon the years passed as the months had done before. Now and then Byron made a short visit to his old home. Suddenly he realized that his beloved mother was growing old.</p>

<p>&#8220;What if Mother should die?&#8221; he asked himself when he got news that she was failing in health. Sorrow settled over his heart. &#8220;She has been so much to me. How could I part with her?&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;Mother is dangerously sick. Come home at once.&#8221; It was a telegram from his brother, and Byron was soon on board a train. It was a happy surprise to find Mother in her chair and able to greet him when he arrived. What a tearful and happy meeting that was!</p>

<p>&#8220;I will stay with you, Mother,&#8221; Byron said, after family worship the next day. </p>

<p>&#8220;I would like that very much,&#8221; she said with a quiet smile. &#8220;Could you please read the 103rd Psalm to me?&#8221; The Bible never seemed so much an inspiration and strength as he read it that morning. When he had repeated several of her favorite passages, she said, &#8220;Though we deserve nothing, how merciful and good the Lord has been to us! And if we do well, we shall reign with Him in heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>She seemed very weak, so Byron closed the Bible and knelt beside her chair. He prayed, thanking God for the blessing she had been on his life. </p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so thankful that I&#8217;ve been spared until you came, but I&#8217;m tired and should like to rest.&#8221; Those were the last words that she ever spoke, for in a few short hours the summons came for her to depart. As Byron looked upon that dear sweet face, he noted the gentle expression that marked the strength and depth of her life. Those ashen lips could no longer warn him of danger, but they had directed him to the One who could not only warn him, but pilot his soul into the haven she had entered at last.</p>

<h1>The Decorated Dollhouse</h1>

<p>&#8220;Mommy, come look at our doll house,&#8221; chorused the two happy little girls as they heard mother&#8217;s footsteps coming down the hall. Mother set down her basket of clothes and stepped into the bedroom to enter into their world of learning and see what they had made, or how they had arranged their rooms this time.</p>

<p>To mother&#8217;s surprise they had found a tiny green and white trim among the craft supplies, and had put it all around the door and windows of the doll house. There was also a tiny tree in the house with the trim draped around it. It was a marvelous discovery in the world of miniature houses! It was very beautiful! But mother&#8217;s heart was not at ease. As mother went back to her work, she prayed for the Lord&#8217;s guidance in this matter. They had never put up Christmas lights, as they did not want to join in with the way the world celebrated Christ&#8217;s birth. Nor had they ever had a Christmas tree in their home. Why? Didn&#8217;t Jeremiah the prophet say,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Hear ye the word which the Lord speaketh unto you, O house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them. For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe. They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+10%3A1-4" title="Jeremiah 10:1-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jeremiah 10:1-4)</span></a></span>
The Lord continued talking to the mother in faithfulness, and so the first woman, Eve, came to mind, and how the second step to her disobedience was in the fact that &#8220;she looked&#8221; at the forbidden fruit.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+3%3A6" title="Genesis 3:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 3:6)</span></a></span>
The Lord also said, &#8220;Do you remember the uneasy feeling in your heart when you and your husband would drive by that most magnificent, dazzling show of Christmas lights on the homes built around the lake?&#8221; It was a huge attraction every year. Hundreds of cars would drive by this area to view the creativity of the homeowners. Beautiful things draw the eye. The devil understands this and ensnares many people by this means. How we need to be aware and listen to the gentle pricks of the Holy Spirit warning us of danger.</p>

<p>How small the seed starts! How sly of our enemy to use our eyes to desire things. No wonder the Word says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Keep thy heart with all diligence.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+4%3A23" title="Proverbs 4:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 4:23)</span></a></span>
I really had not desired those things as we drove around looking at them. And I remember very well the thought, should we really be doing this? We don&#8217;t want to give the devil any room in our hearts. Don&#8217;t let him have the first step. Don&#8217;t listen to himwhich was Eve&#8217;s first mistake toward disobedience.</p>

<p>The thoughtful mother saw her duty toward her children and how she could not allow them to play like they had Christmas lights on their dollhouse and please the Lord. Wouldn&#8217;t this be the devil&#8217;s plan to build up desire in their eyes? It would hide the true riches from them. She then went into her little girls&#8217; room and shared the thoughts the Lord had given.</p>

<p>They had first made some curtains out of fabric scraps. When they wearied of that, the devil had suggested to pretend this doll house family was an unsaved family. Then their imagination grew and they began decorating for Christmas. But they willingly took it all down. Mother gave them a tiny nativity scene so this doll house family could remember Christ&#8217;s birthday in a way that would honor the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>Mothers, may the Lord guide you in the watch you are keeping over the little ones He has placed in your care. May they grow up to be trees of righteousness, a planting of the Lord.</p>

<h1>Should We Celebrate Christ&#8217;s Birth?</h1>

<p>This was a question we asked ourselves a few years ago. As a child I was reared in a godly home and there was a complete abstinence from all the glitter and glamorous decorations and a godly resistance to the whole Santa Claus spirit. As I later realized, this is none other than a distraction from the enemy to get the minds of the people away from Jesus. Just think about it! The same thing has happened to Easter. The devil created the Easter bunny and Easter eggs to distract little innocent minds away from the awe and wonderfulness of Christ&#8217;s resurrection. Just ask most any child off the street about Easter, and the first thing that pops into their mind is the bunny and colored eggs. The devil is indeed sly. He studies our weakness and plans temptations accordingly. He understands the imaginative mind of a child and what appeals to them and is planting his seed early.</p>

<p>In both cases, mythical characters have been created. Children are told that Santa Claus knows if you have been good or bad. Children are encouraged to write letters to Santa and leave cookies for him to enjoy when he brings them gifts. After awhile the children grow up and realize that there is not a Santa after all. Their parents have been tricking them by telling all these untruths. Now for the real trap the enemy has set! Children have been told about these mythical characters and thought they were real. In many cases these same children have been told about God and that He also knows and sees you all the time, too. Can you see the trap? After the child realizes Santa is not real, the natural question is: is God not real either? Parents beware! Don&#8217;t fall into these seemingly innocent little pleasures. These are really deep, dark traps of a sly, evil enemy. We may think that Bin Laden is our enemy, but he is just getting his ideas from the master enemy who plans and schemes continually for the destruction of our souls and the souls of our children.</p>

<p>Having exposed the devil in his way of celebrating Christmas, is there a correct way, or should we not remember it at all? These thoughts were our prayer: &#8220;Lord, direct us. Do you want us to celebrate Your birth?&#8221; There are many voices out there. One family celebrates it in September, as that seems to be a more accurate time according to their research. Others even abandon having a nativity scene. The list goes on&#8230;&#8203;and our prayer continued, Lord, what do you want us to do?</p>

<p>December came and our younger daughter was directing activities for a couple of neighbor children. The same nativity scene that our children had learned from was brought out, and now our daughter was telling the story of Jesus&#8217; birth as each figure was carefully unwrapped. These two little childrenthe oldest was in kindergarten and the other a little youngerhad never heard the real Christmas story! As I observed the young teacher and the little ones, my heart was blessed and our prayer had been answered. What could be a better way to teach children about Jesus&#8217; birth!</p>

<p>In reading the Word of God, we find this was a great event.
It was prophesied, and it was an event for which people were waiting (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+2%3A25">Luke 2:25</a>).
God sent a multitude of angels to announce the birth of this holy babe. This was and is the very means of our salvation and the devil is working very hard to cover it all up by the cheap glamour and lies of Satan. May God help us to keep proclaiming His birth and telling the wonderful story.</p>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">Alone, storm-bound, with the last food divided among the six of them&#8230;&#8203;but willing to trust a Divine promise. Can we look at a true story of God&#8217;s care and not be inspired to like faith?</p>
</div>


<h1>A Widow&#8217;s Wonderful Deliverance</h1>

<p class="author">E. M. Dodson</p>

<p>In the winter of 1855, in the state of Iowa, the snow fell early, in November, to the depth of two feet. The storm was the kind that neither man nor beast could move against.</p>

<p>In a log cabin, six miles from her nearest relative, lived a widow with five children, ranging from one to eleven years. The supply of food and fuel was but scant when the snow began falling; and day after day the small store melted away, until the fourth evening, when the last provisions were cooked for supper, and barely enough fuel remained to last one day more. That night, as was her custom, the little ones were called around her knee to hear the Scripture lesson read, before commending them to the Heavenly Father&#8217;s care. Then, bowing in prayer, she pleaded as only those in like condition can plead, that help from God might be sent. While wrestling with God in prayer, the Spirit took the words of the Psalmist and impressed them on her heart:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+37%3A35" title="Psalm 37:35"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 37:35)</span></a></span>
And again, these words came as if spoken audibly:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger; but they that seek the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> shall want no good thing.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+34%3A10" title="Psalm 34:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 34:10)</span></a></span>
Faith took God at His word; and with an assurance that help would come, she prayed God who heareth prayer, and retired to rest without a care or fear for the morrow. When again the morning broke, that mother arose, kindled her fire, and put on the kettle as she had done on other days before the food was all gone. Just as the sun arose, a man in a sleigh drove up to the house, and hastening in, inquired how they were getting along. Her heart at first was too full for utterance; but in a short time he was told something of their destitution, and of her cry to God for help.</p>

<p>He replied. &#8220;Last night about nine o&#8217;clock, wife and I were both impressed that you were in need. Spending almost a sleepless night, I hastened at early dawn, to come and inquire about the case.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, returning to his sleigh, he took into the house breadstuff, meat and groceries, so that mother had abundance to prepare a breakfast for the little ones, who had eaten the last bread the night before. And, as if to make the case above-mentioned a special providence, without a doubt remaining, the individual who was thus impressed&#8212;at the very hour that mother was crying to God&#8212;was a stranger to the circumstances and surroundings of this family. Indeed, he had never been in that house before, nor had ever showed any interest in the person referred to; but he ever afterwards proved a friend indeed.</p>

<p>Now, after years have rolled around, and these children are all married and settled in homes of their own, that mother&#8217;s heart is still strengthened to bear hardships and trust in God, by the recollections of that hour, when faith in God was so tested, and yet was so triumphant.</p>

<p>Let skeptics ridicule the idea of a special providence, or lightly speak of prayer. One heart will ever believe God&#8217;s ear in mercy is open to the cry of the feeblest of His children, when in distress their cry goes up for help to Him.</p>

<blockquote><p class="first">From <i>Golden Thoughts on Mother, Home, and Heaven</i></p>
</blockquote>


<h1>A Lesson for Mothers: A Child&#8217;s View of Scolding</h1>

<p>A little girl once said, &#8220;Mother, does God ever scold?&#8221; She had seen her mother, under circumstances of strong provocation, lose her temper, and give way to the impulse of passion; and pondering thoughtfully for a moment, she asked: &#8220;Mother, does God ever scold?&#8221;</p>

<p>The question was so abrupt and startling, that it arrested the mother&#8217;s attention almost with a shock, and she said: &#8220;Why, my child, what makes you ask such a question?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because, mother, you have always told me that God was good, and that we should try to be like Him; and I should like to know if He ever scolds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my child; of course not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad He don&#8217;t, for scolding always hurts me, even if I feel I have done wrong; and it don&#8217;t seem to me that I could love God very much if He scolded.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mother felt rebuked before her simple child. Never before had she heard so forcible a lecture on the evils of scolding. The words of the child sank deep in her heart and she turned away from the innocent face of her little one to hide the tears that gathered to her eyes. Children are quick observers; and the child, seeing the effect of her words, eagerly inquired:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you cry, mother? Was it naughty for me to say what I said?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my love, it was all right; I was only thinking that I might have spoken more kindly, and not have hurt your feelings by speaking so hastily, and in anger, as I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mother, you are good and kind; only I wish there were not so many bad things to make you fret and talk as you did just now. It makes me feel away from you so far, as if I could not come near you, as I can when you speak kindly. And, oh, sometimes I fear I shall be put off so far I can never get back again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my child, don&#8217;t say that,&#8221; said the mother, unable to keep back her tears, as she felt how her tones had repelled her little one from her heart; and the child, wondering what had so affected her parent, but intuitively feeling it was a case requiring sympathy, reached up, and throwing her arms about her mother&#8217;s neck, whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, dear mother, do I make you cry? Do you love me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! I love you more than I can tell,&#8221; said the parent, clasping the little one to her bosom; &#8220;and I will try never to scold again; but if I have to reprove my child, I will try to do it, not in anger, but kindly, deeply as I may be grieved that she has done wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am so glad. I can get so near to you if you don&#8217;t scold! And do you know, mother, I want to love you so much, and I will try always to be good?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lesson was one that sank deep in that mother&#8217;s heart, and has been an aid to her for many years. It impressed the great principle of reproving in kindness, not in anger, if we would gain the great end of reproof&#8212;that of winning the child to what is right, and to the parent&#8217;s heart.</p>

<h1>On Scolding</h1>

<p>No woman who would retain her true ascendancy in her family can afford to scold. It is the most undignified, belittling, disenchanting, self-disrespecting performance that any one can engage in at any time or under any circumstances; but it is especially so in the case of a mother and housekeeper.</p>

<p>Scolding may be distinguished from the giving of reproof, for which there is often occasion in the best-regulated families, by its being an expression of personal irritability, and by the intended effect of producing irritation and discomfort in those around. Its most frequent form of expression is a sort of generalization which is usually false, from some single difficulty which is irremediable except by specific action. &#8220;You children are the most disorderly creatures I have ever seen; you leave your hats in one place and your books in another, and keep me forever picking up after you,&#8221; says the petulant mother. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t pick up your things better, I will &#8212;&#8221; and here follow the ineffectual threats of the scolding mood. The words are worse than thrown away; they do positive harm. The child who is at fault on the occasion escapes conviction through the general accusation and blame thrown upon all, while the children who are not at fault are irritated and resent the injustice. A moment&#8217;s reflection would convince a sensible mother that such petulant, useless complaint would accomplish no good; but this is really not her object. She feels uncomfortable, discommoded, and irritated, and disposed to vent her irritation on those around, and to make them sharers in her discomfort.</p>

<p>The true way to remedy disorder among children is kindly but firmly to compel each one to pick up and put away and take care of his own things. To accomplish this may often require severe reproof and even punishment, but it should be administered individually, and if possible privately, with tone and manner free from personal irritation, and with especial care not to lay the blame for the disorder on those who are not responsible for it.</p>

<p>So of the scores and hundred of occasions in family life which try the temper of the mistress. If the cook is careless and sends the meals to the table improperly prepared, how useless, how disagreeable, for the mistress of the house to utter a general tirade against cooks during the progress of the meal! How worse than useless afterward for her to tell the cook that as a class cooks are worthless, wasteful, and incompetent, that they don&#8217;t earn their wages, and to indulge in harsh epithets and threats!</p>

<p>There is no quicker way to lose the respect of servants and to demoralize them than to scold at them in a general way when irritated. All faults charged should be specifically named, and the requirement made positive that such faults must be remedied. This is the only way consistent with the dignity of a mistress, and it is too often rendered nugatory by the fact that mistresses are not in a position to present an alternative. They are more dependent upon servants, in our present condition of household service, than servants are upon them. But at all events scolding only makes matters worse, not better.</p>

<p>Scolding is, in fact, either the weak expedient of a character too weak to remedy or remove evils, or it is the weapon and defense of the inferior.</p>

<p>Here is a husband who has certain habits which irritate and discommode his wife. She revenges herself by scolding and by declaring that he always does such things; that all men are naturally selfish and mean, and more words to the same effect, which cause irritation only. Nothing could be more derogatory to a wife&#8217;s influence than such a course. She should decide to force an issue by firmness and determination, and compel a respect for her rights and wishes in family matters, or she should make up her mind to overlook such peculiarities and arrange her life accordingly. Either she must cure the evil or adapt herself to it; but let her not on any account degrade herself to scold about it.</p>

<p>But if a scolding woman is so disgraceful and discordant a factor in a family, what shall be said of a scolding man? The man who, because business has gone wrong, or customers have deceived him, or employees have cheated him, comes home and vents his irritability on his family, is wholly inexcusable.</p>

<p>It is amusing to notice how a scolding man often displays, in an exaggerated form, the very weaknesses and follies that are usually charged more particularly upon women. He, too, will generalize from one fact in a most inconsequent way. If the room is too warm, he will declare that it is always like an oven; if it is too cold, he will assert that his wife never has enough fuel put in the fire; if the table is not up to the standard, he will wonder why he can never get a decent meal at home; if the children are fretful, they are the crossest, worse-trained children ever known. If the servants make a mistake, the whole class of servants is denounced, and the denunciation is usually wound up with the declaration that women are not fit to manage servants anyway, and that their insubordination and failures are all owing to women&#8217;s incompetency to train and govern them. A man, by a single evening&#8217;s scolding, can disseminate enough discomfort and irritability through a household to make everybody uncomfortable for a week.</p>

<p> Everywhere and under all circumstances, scolding has this distinguishing characteristic: it is intended to wound somebody, to hurt somebody, to make somebody uncomfortable, not with a remedial design, but simply as a relief to an inward personal irritation. Its effect on family life is like throwing sand into a delicate machine; it causes all parts to grate upon each other; it does no good, but only evil, and that continually.</p>

<h1>Thoughts on Motherhood</h1>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Taking the position of a new mother is just that&#8212;new, something you haven&#8217;t done before. Some are blessed with moms and grandmothers, aunts or cousins who may try to prepare one for motherhood. But only until the responsibility is yours does the reality come home that all those instructions will not only be helpful but very needful.</p>

<p>The best way to be a new mom is to be a God-fearing married woman who has already established trust in the heart of her husband, and just as equally important, she&#8212;as an individual&#8212;has a degree of confidence along with the awareness that the position she &#8220;holds,&#8221; in turn, holds her responsible. God divinely designed the mother to bear and deliver the child, linking the child to its father. The mother is in the center of the family&#8212;she is the hub, yet portrays a servant-like being.</p>

<p>While the child develops during its first 36 week gestation period, the new mother must be as stress-free as possible. Allow your new joy and anticipation&#8212;strength and help from the Lord to be expressed. Dispel all doubt, fear, anxiety and negativity because what affects mama influences baby. It&#8217;s not just another baby child to feed and clothe&#8212;it&#8217;s an immortal soul.</p>

<p>Remember, being a mother is a huge responsibility.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>The Bible is full of wisdom and instructions for parents. Like Hannah, we must make for our Samuel a little coat from year to year. We must provide for the growing, developing, changing body, mind, and soul, and develop with him.</p>

<p>It is the atmosphere we create in the home that makes the child; that indefinable something that is restful, loving, thoughtful, understanding, and kind; that cheers, ennobles, encourages, and inspires. Good taste, neatness and order, books, pictures and music all help. Riches are not a necessary requirement for these things. Two devoted parents, with a vision, will find a way&#8212;happy meal times, quiet fireside talks, and simple home celebrations of birthdays and holidays.</p>

<p>The delicate plants of childhood will not thrive and develop and blossom in an atmosphere of harsh blame or criticism. Some one has said, &#8220;Nagging and fault-finding in the home are twin brothers to the jail and penitentiary.&#8221; Home is a good place for the exercise of Christian dignity and refinement, to show forth all that is beautiful and glorious in Christian living.</p>

<p>&#8212;<i>Quest and Conquests,</i> by Evaline D. Green</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>The child&#8217;s first idea of prayer comes to him when an infant, by the mother&#8217;s kneeling beside the crib in prayer; her bowed head and kneeling body tell of submission to and reverence for a power greater than herself; her tone of voice when she speaks of sacred things is far more effectual with the little listener than the words she says.</p>

<p>There are four steps to disciplining a child:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure they understand the offence.</li>

<li>Telling them the Bible requires you as a parent to administer the punishment.</li>

<li>The punishment.</li>

<li>Forgiving the child and letting them know you love them.</li>

</ol>
<hr class="minor" />
<p>In prayer, one mother promises to study the child, and seek to find what gifts and graces God had implanted, and to nourish them.</p>

<p>A grandmother said, &#8220;Each child comes with their own key.&#8221; It&#8217;s the parents&#8217; responsibility to pray for guidance in dealing and finding the key to each child.</p>

<h1>The Lord&#8217;s Dealings with Me on Higher Education Training</h1>

<p>I really never thought I&#8217;d be writing an article on this topic. I&#8217;ve always thought that this subject was a personal matter between God and the individual considering it. I didn&#8217;t think there was a &#8220;truth&#8221; to be found, just merely determining if this was God&#8217;s desired will or no. I felt I had an excellent, balanced position on it, and was proceeding down the path of that thought. Then God began to speak to me.</p>

<p>Up until the time I got saved, my life was marked with a deep sense of pride of my family, and a whole lot of worldly ambition. This was inherent; I did not chose those qualities, but possessed them all the same. When the Lord changed my heart, the desire for the world left, and I was greatly humbled. However, God doesn&#8217;t change our basic personality. Deep within my subconscious mind, certain lines of thought were there which with I had no reason to account. I liked &#8220;rich&#8221; looking things. I was not drawn to plainness of dress. I valued too highly the opinion of men and the world. I loved God with all my heart and for no reason at all would I step into sin to please my humanity. Yet&#8230;&#8203;why was I drawn? I had given up all to follow Jesus and did not have the slightest desire to go back.</p>

<p>Jesus began to lead me into a deeper consecration, a hollowing out of myself, so that He might reign supremely. I consecrated and consecrated, letting go of all myself, until at last I knew that Jesus was completely first and in control. I was submitted, consecrated, willing and ready to be or do what Jesus wanted. It was as the song says:</p>

<p class="verse">Within my heart were fond ambitions,<br />Vain pride and hopes of worldly fame,<br />But still remained a place so vacant,<br />Unfilled by highest earthly aim.<br />Then Jesus reached His hand to help me,<br />&#8220;Come, seek my love,&#8221; I heard Him say,<br />I quickly left the world behind me,<br />To follow Jesus all the way.</p>

<p>The world was behind me, but my love and consecration were yet untested. And through the next few years, I found that to consecrate only once, was to lose at the beginning. For like many children, the devil doesn&#8217;t take &#8220;No&#8221; for an answer easily. I found there were many things to submit to God, my feelings most of all. It seemed that the inherited sin nature I had was gone, but the devil would bring them back in the most subtle, beguiling ways. I realized that if I were to ever take one step away from closely following the Lord, I would be lost.</p>

<p>This said, let me share with you my &#8220;considering college&#8221; struggle. I had always assumed I would go to college. Neither of my parents did, but I had strong encouragement from one set of grandparents, and I just liked the idea. At ten or eleven I couldn&#8217;t tell you what I would do there, but I knew I was going. I didn&#8217;t receive encouragement from my parents in this direction, but I maintained that I wanted to go. Considering my youth, I don&#8217;t think my parents really thought about my desire. Years passed, and I felt more intensely that I wished to attend; at this time, specifically to gain a teacher&#8217;s degree for elementary education. I had always loved children, and had some areas of responsibility. I taught preschool one year to a couple of girls, and that strengthened my desire to go to college. I felt the Lord&#8217;s blessing in teaching. I wanted to be trained further. At this time I was publishing, teaching, doing my own studies, and caring for a little girl after school. I knew that if I went to college when I finished high school that 1, I would no longer have time to publish, 2, the little girl I was caring for would have to go (Her mother had no desire to raise her&#8212;could I really push her out?), 3, I would, of course, have to quit teaching at the present. Essentially, college would take four years of my life&#8212;I couldn&#8217;t do anything else, really, between working to support going, and going there itself. I prayed about it a lot. I worked schedules in my mind to see how I could do some of the things I knew God wanted me to do as well as go. God gave me the scripture,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Ye cannot serve God and mammon.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+13%3A16" title="Luke 13:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 13:16)</span></a></span>
I said, &#8220;But this is to further Your work. I want to be better equiped to teach for You.&#8221; God got it across to me that it was me and not Him that wanted me to go. Did I really think that God&#8217;s training ground was a huge, secular college? The Lord humbled me as I realized that I did not have the strength to withstand the huge doses of humanism I would receive. I had been like a person contemplating going out to a river and holding onto a tree branch a few inches from the water where the current flows an opposite direction. I would have drowned, spiritually speaking.</p>

<p>College now far from my mind, I turned to pursue the steps of the Lord leading me toward His work in teaching. A few more years passed and I still hadn&#8217;t finished high school due to some ministry work. I began looking at seriously finishing up my work so I could teach school full time in my own home. Because I was caring for two children now that were in public school, I was involved enough to see some of the happenings there. Some of it fascinated me and gave me ideas for my own classroom; other things opened my eyes to the infinite neglect children receive when in large classrooms with half-hearted teachers. There was obviously a great need for teachers. Some teachers I admired and learned from; in many ways I began to think more and more that I could teach at home for a while as I needed experience, and then go to teaching &#8220;professionally&#8221; some day. Oh, how subtle is the devil! Sowing these seeds, the subject of college once again resurfaced. Would I go back on what God had told me? No, but this time, it was presented in a more platable way. I could take a correspondence course, and still be at home to care for the children! I would not be submerged in the worldly atmosphere on the college campus. How dangerous it is to reason things in our minds! I prayed about this, but I really didn&#8217;t have the thing submitted to God. I jumped to the conclusion that He was giving me the go-ahead and bounded off to enroll in a correspondence highschool to give me a diploma that would gain me entrance into college. This mistake was to cost me much in trials ahead. My insensitivity to God&#8217;s will fogged over the communication line between God and me, and though I still talked with Him, our relationship was more distant. Blessings and victories seemed to be few and far between. I wish that what I have written was not true. I wish I could say I kept in close contact and never strayed from God&#8217;s perfect will. However, the above is true, and I write it as a warning. We are excitable human beings and tend to run off in tangents according to our feelings. It is so important when praying about any decision where feelings and emotions are involved that we stay entirely submitted to the will of God. We must not move until we have definite direction. If I had done so, this story may have been much shorter. </p>

<p>During the time I studied in the correspondence school, I tutored, taught summer school, and subscribed to numerous teacher&#8217;s lists over e-mail. I began to hear quite a few &#8220;inside&#8221; things from many public school teachers. The hated regulations and restrictions that made it impossible to teach effectively did not sound compatible with fulfilling the burden I had of touching children&#8217;s lives. More and more the Lord opened my eyes to the fact that He was calling me to help children escape from the public school institution. I cringed at this. I didn&#8217;t want to be known as a &#8220;child stealer&#8221;&#8212;and looked down upon from the educational system. I admired certain teachers and winced at the thought of being on the &#8220;ememy lines&#8221; against them. For if I were to homeschool children, taking them from their public school classes, I knew how I would be considered. An outcast&#8212;is that what I was called to be? It was if I were looking out over two camps&#8212;one promised a comfortable, respected position where I could do a lot of &#8220;good&#8221;&#8212;the other, I would be considered a &#8220;traitor to education,&#8221; a misfit and trouble maker, and child stealer. It would be infinitely harder to get to the children as most are trapped in the public system. Surely I could do much more good within than without?!</p>

<p>About this time, it became apparent that one lady we knew was in real trouble with her nine-year-old daughter. The child had become quite listless. Her mother had pushed her into an accelerated learning class at school, and she was actually a little slow. This had resulted in the shutting down of her mind as there was too much pressure to think. She was now going in the fourth grade, but could not spell words such as &#8220;pet&#8221; or &#8220;rat.&#8221; She could slowly do basic math facts such as 5 + 4, but that was about the extent of her learning. She did read some, but comprehended nothing. We had a burden for her, and the Lord worked so that her mother was willing for me to school her. This left me with a fork in the road: would I choose the path to teaching at an institution where I would have the praise of men or would I go the difficult route of taking the children that nobody wants? I am thankful that by this time, God had been working on me, and this was not much of a choice. I died to the idea of being accepted and liked by other teachers and educational places. I died to the idea of ever fitting in anywhere on earth. I continued my high school correspondence school knowing I needed to finish school, but college was not my goal. I knew God had other plans, and I was ready to do His will. Fall of 2001 found me teaching a small class in a classroom God had built on the back of our deck. It was small, humble, and adequate. Though there were those that turned it down because of the &#8220;poorness&#8221; of it, I was content. This was God&#8217;s way for His classroom and I was happy to be His servant.</p>

<p>The devil was not yet satisfied. He knew my tendencies, and once more devised a cunning plan. There are in our neighborhood two little girls whom we have known since babyhood, and who desired very much to be homeschooled in our school. Their situation, however, is complicated by the fact that their divorced parents are divided on the issue of schooling. The mother desires homeschooling; the father, a teacher, is totally opposed. Taken to court, this issue was decided that homeschooling was not an option, but private or public school would be acceptable. I have long carried a burden for these girls, and prayed much that God would make a way for them. As their desire increased, so did ours, and we began to look into what it would take to become a private school. I had obtained a Christian school&#8217;s Teacher Certification, but I was fairly certain that this would not be satisfactory to the father of the girls. This was fine for becoming a private school, but knowing him, I was sure he would take it back to court, proclaiming me to be an unfit teacher, just as he had done with his wife. This would jeopardize the rest of my class as well, I thought. I prayed and prayed about this matter, laying it again and again before God. College was closed. What were my options? I received no answer in prayer. In retrospect, I believe God was testing me to see if I would again jump the gun and go ahead on my own.</p>

<p>At this time I received a letter in the mail from my correspondence school. The contents shocked me. It was a notice of some regulations that had been overlooked at my registration. I had been out of compliance with the rules for nearly a year and to my consternation, these regulations must be observed to receive any credit or diploma (high school). I was devastated. A year of credit, a year of getting up at 3 a.m. and studying until school time, was lost&#8212;gone! My parents tried to encourage me that the knowledge I&#8217;d learned was not lost, but I couldn&#8217;t see past the lost credits I&#8217;d worked so hard to gain. Truly depressed, I wished I could quit school, quit teaching and simply crawl in a large hole.</p>

<p>But life goes on. I still had seven students to teach five days a week. How could I encourage them in school if I quit myself? I knew the Lord had allowed this to happen, and prayed for the good that I knew He had in it. I&#8217;d had many reasons to be unhappy with the correspondence school, and my parents encouraged me that it would probably be better just to do work on my own, get a GED, and study as I taught. I was at another fork in the road. Should I, 1, do school on my own and get a GED, 2, switch correspondence schools, 3, start over with my present situation? Of all options, #3 was least appealing, with #1, a close runner-up. I examined my motives and felt thoroughly confused. I knew that God was not the author of confusion, but I felt pressure to make a decision. If I were to choose working at home and go the GED route, I faced the prospect that the father against homeschooling could make a case against me, and shut me down from teaching. I wasn&#8217;t sure how it would come out in court, but I didn&#8217;t want to find out, as the judge that would rule was the same one who had decided against the mother teaching them. I wasn&#8217;t anxious to find his ruling on a seventeen-year-old girl with only a GED and Christian school certification. If I continued with the school I had, I was sure he&#8217;d find complaint because of numerous reasons. If I switched, the thought came to me, I could find a well-known correspondence high school that hopefully he&#8217;d respect and the schooling of the girls&#8217; could be settled out of court. I prayed and laid this all out before the Lord for many weeks. The only answer that ever came was the scripture, &#8220;Be still and know that I am God.&#8221; Be still. Over and over, this scripture came in my personal devotions, in prayer. I knew this was my answer&#8212;yet, it didn&#8217;t seem like an answer. Finishing high school wasn&#8217;t an option&#8212;especially since I was teaching&#8212;how could I simply be &#8220;still&#8221;?</p>

<p>My thoughts began to formulate enough that I realized that what I really wanted to do was to switch schools. It seemed liked a logical and disciplined thing to do. I&#8217;d find a good, well-known, respected high school, finish off there and&#8230;. what? What would I do? The question of college had been settled. Why go to a good, well-known, fully accredited high school? Why not, unless I was going to college? Why did it matter that it was well-known and respected? Why were those qualities important? I said, &#8220;It&#8217;s because of the girls. Their dad will respect my school and teaching if I&#8217;ve graduated from a respected high school.&#8221; The Lord reminded me that this man was one of the most irrational men I&#8217;d met and many times acted totally without reason or consideration of facts. This was quite true. My number-one reason was now gone, but the feeling of desire for this plan of action was still there. I didn&#8217;t understand it. I said, &#8220;Lord, why do I feel this way?&#8221; I realized that the only reason I wanted to attend a fully accredited school was because I still did want to take a correspondence college course after that. The little foxes had come again and unwittingly, I had let them spoil the vines of my consecration.</p>

<p>But the devil said, &#8220;What would be wrong with taking the correspondence school? You have to finish high school. After that, you could just take some college courses&#8230;&#8203;and become a real teacher. (As if teaching seven children in my own classroom was not real enough!) He also recalled to my mind a story I&#8217;d read about a man who wished to become a doctor, but lacked the funds to go to college. So he wiggled his way to the position of being an apprentice to learn the trade, and then stole the identification of another doctor that carried the same name. He studied books, learned his trade well, and simply cut through all the &#8220;red tape&#8221; to a high-paying position in the medical profession. After 27 years&#8217; practice, he made a mistake that killed someone, and ended up in prison on fraud. Satan whispered, &#8220;That is what you are doing. You want the easy way out&#8212;you know you don&#8217;t have the brains for college, so you&#8217;re going to learn the art of a con artist!&#8221; It is dangerous to listen to the devil. I began to feel cornered. I did not wish to be a con artist. I felt my lack and inability as a teacher, especially after teaching a full time crew! Was I proud to resist the idea of more training? I wanted to be qualified. Thoughts raged through my brain.</p>

<p>One Sunday morning I sat listening to a message on David and Goliath when a revelation of truth hit me. The minister was reading from
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Samuel+17">I&nbsp;Samuel 17</a>,
wherein David had come before Saul, at Saul&#8217;s request, to be seen before going out to fight Goliath. Saul was protesting his youth and lack of military training. I thought, &#8220;David had not been through their equivalent of West Point, therefore they did not have confidence in him.&#8221; How I could identify! It was true then, too, that if you had not gone through man&#8217;s tests and training, they did not accept you. But as David went on to describe his experiences with the lion and the bear, the Lord spoke to me. He said, &#8220;No, David had not been to &#8216;West Point&#8217;&#8212;he was trained by <i>Me</i>, for <i>My</i> work. David was My servant, and I taught him. You want to be qualified&#8212;if you are to become qualified for My work, it will be through Me, not through a professor of college! I train My workers&#8212;they train theirs; which field are you laboring in?&#8221; This hit me like a ton of bricks&#8212;I realized then, that whatever advantages a degree in teaching might give me, I would lose the only thing worth having&#8212;Jesus, as my teacher and guide. No matter what &#8220;good&#8221; I would be able to accomplish, this path had not the worn feet of my Commander. No, I wouldn&#8217;t have the thorns bestrewing the path; I would be free from the cumbersome sense of a traveler with no home, but at what cost?</p>

<p class="verse">There&#8217;s a line that is drawn by rejecting the Lord,<br />Where the call of His Spirit is lost,<br />But you hurry along with the pleasure-mad throng;<br />Have you counted, have you counted the cost?</p>

<p class="verse">Have you counted the cost, if your soul should be lost?<br />Though you gain the whole world for your own?<br />Even now it may be that the line you have crossed;<br />Have you counted, have you counted the cost?</p>

<p>The cost may be great to give up every inch of the world&#8217;s ways, but to accept it is to reject the Lord, which has greater costs than we can fathom. It is far, far better to leave the easy route and live for eternity.</p>

<p>What path did our Master take? Did He go to the &#8220;colleges&#8221; of His day? No, but He spent 40 days of school in prayer and fasting before begining His ministry. God was His teacher, and if we want the same blessed life Jesus lived, we must take Him as our trainer as well. If we really want to do some good and accomplish the purpose for which we were sent, we will have to go through <i>God&#8217;s</i> training school. I feel certain that to take any other route and then try to do the Lord&#8217;s work will result in an inability to do anything for the Lord as we will be filled up with the ways of man. At the least, we will have much unlearning to do, and God&#8217;s school still to go through before we can be of any use to Him. How much better to simply follow Him from the start!</p>

<p>Writing this article has not been easy. Sharing some of my difficult struggles&#8212;&#8220;soul-baring,&#8221; someone put it&#8212;has not been my choice, but the one of my Leader. I am sure that I will hear from some of you violently disagreeing with me, and others of you will disdain to even write, but disagree all the same. I am sure that the popular theme song, &#8220;The Lord leads everyone differently&#8221; will be paraded. To this I wish to answer now: You may differ from me in anyway you like. You may go to college and enjoy its blessings and curses, but you will have to answer to God for yourself. For me, the fact that the devil tried in so many ways to trap me into going, is a red flag. If he cared so much about my attendance, I can be sure that to go would have been to my soul&#8217;s damage. If the devil worked so hard at this, am I justified in coming to the conclusion that it is a rather dangerous place? I ask that you consider these thoughts and not brush them off lightly.</p>

<p>Many of us are coming to the place where our consecration to be &#8220;all the Lord&#8217;s&#8221; is being tested by the pressures of young adulthood. This time may not be as easy as when we first gave our hearts to the Lord, but continuing and renewing of our consecration is vital&#8212;and absolutely worth it in the end.</p>

<h1>He is Still God</h1>

<p>There&#8217;s a phrase in one of my song tapes that says, &#8220;And He is still God.&#8221; As I sit here this night composing this letter to you, in my heart there comes this thought to me. Through the past months that you have lived, and I have lived, we&#8217;ve experienced our trials and battles, our victories and joys. And through it all, God has still been God. I&#8217;m thankful so much for the promise of &#8220;Immanuel&#8221; (God be with us). So many people struggle through life&#8217;s tempestuous seas alone. Sometimes sinking when a storm comes, or struggling to stay afloat, they manage on, day after day, month after month, year after year. Working with many people and their children, I see this exemplified time and time again. People who are alone when life&#8217;s troubles come: a death, financial loss, marriage trials, losses of jobs, troubles with neighbors, stresses with raising their children. People strive to keep their heads above water as the waves roll on. And when disaster strikes, as it does, they set back on their heels and despair. Why? Because they are doing their best and yet their sand castle still melts under the rising tide. There is no hope but they&#8217;re doing all they can. When will they realize that life is too big for them, that they need help from a higher source?</p>

<p>He is still God. Throughout all of people&#8217;s trouble and struggles, there is still One who can help, and would help if only asked.</p>

<p>Recently the Lord has led me through some waters: not shallow waters that I could easily wade through, and not waters I could easily swim through. Water over my head, all around, and very overwhelming. Tonight, as I write, I am filled with unspeakable thankfulness that God was still God through it all. Thankful that God is able to carry me through, no matter how deep the water is or may get, for the trials are not over. Thankful that because He is God, I can have:</p>

<p class="verse">Peace in the time of trouble,<br />Peace in the midst of the storm,<br />Peace though the world be raging,<br />In the shelter of His arm.</p>

<p>How many have peace tonight? Too few for sure. There are so few people who know that God is still on the throne. An even smaller amount of people know that they can have a life hid with Christ in the shelter of His loving arms.</p>

<p>There are so many restless, apprehensive people out there on this earth. Why? Because they know not the peace that comes from having committed their way unto the Lord. They&#8217;re striving to look out for themselves and their families, never dreaming that they could give the burden up and possess peace.</p>

<p>A quote from <i>The Hidden Life</i> seems apt here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">A vessel at one time was in an angry storm at sea. Among the many passengers on board was a skeptic, a Christian lady, and her little boy. During the storm the skeptic was in great alarm, but he could not help noticing the calmness and restfulness of the lady and her boy. After the storm was over, he talked with the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;My child,&#8221; he began, &#8220;were you not afraid during the storm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;And why were you not afraid?&#8221; inquired the skeptic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because my mama was with me,&#8221; answered the lad.</p>

<p>Turning to the mother, the skeptic said, &#8220;Lady, were you not afraid during such a storm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; replied the woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;And why were you not afraid?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said she, &#8220;my Father was with me.&#8221;</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[Orr, Charles E.; <a href="../../../texts/The_Hidden_Life/index.html"><i>The Hidden Life</i></a>, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/The_Hidden_Life/Walking_with_God/index.html">Walking with God</a>&#8221;]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>This woman had learned the secret and had obtained peace. She had put her faith in God, and then trusting Him to do His work, had rested in a peace that made others marvel.</p>

<p>Do we realize that when we have a lack of peace we&#8217;re minimizing God? We&#8217;re no longer trusting that &#8220;He is still God,&#8221; but doubting His sufficiency. Fear says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t trust You to keep Your promise to care for me.&#8221; How ill-founded fears are! Is God no longer God?
Does He no longer own the cattle on a thousand hills? (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+50%3A10">Psalm 50:10</a>).
Is the promise,
&#8220;I will care for you,&#8221; (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+5%3A7">I&nbsp;Peter 5:7</a>)
obsolete? Has the treasure,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;All things work together for good,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A28" title="Romans 8:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 8:28)</span></a></span>
become non-existent? When did God revoke His word? He has not. And He will not. God&#8217;s word still stands, unchanging. It is true when the sun is shining and we feel like skipping among the meadow flowers. What about when the tide changes? The winds blow cold and chill, the dark clouds gather, and we find that far from making progress on our journey up the mountain, we now stand in a lonesome valley. But if we will look, we shall find that God is still God of the valley as well as the mountain top. His word still stands the same, and all the richer and sweeter because of the loss of other alluring distractions.</p>

<p>What hidden riches of peace there is to be found in God! It all comes back to trust in Him. Do you trust God? Do you believe Him and His word? Is He the anchor of your soul? If so, you will have peace, for God would let heaven and earth pass away before He failed the trust of one of His little ones.</p>

<p>This summer, a friend and I taught a group of children a unit study on space. It was simply amazing the little glimpses we got of our gigantic universe. I was enthralled by the vastness compared with our minuteness. And God is bigger than all that. He is so much bigger. There are not words in all the languages throughout this small planet that can come close to describing Him. When fearfulness over the cares of life comes to shroud me, I remind myself of the infinite size of God and His creation. I ask Him for perspective (just thinking of our place in space is pretty humbling!), and the absurdity of my fears is realized.</p>

<p>Oh, God, open our eyes that we might see You! Just a glimpse is all we need-like the song, &#8220;Just His name makes the shadows flee&#8230;. He&#8217;s everything that I need&#8230;.&#8221; When we come to the trials of the road, let&#8217;s remember that the One we serve is still there. For He doth neither slumber nor sleep, but can and will keep us in perfect peace.</p>

<p class="verse">He is still God,<br />And He still sits on His throne,<br />He&#8217;s still God<br />And He still cares for His own,<br />He&#8217;s still the hope of the soul,<br />He&#8217;s still in control,<br />So be still now and know,<br />That He&#8217;s still God.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+10%3A29-31" title="Matthew 10:29-31"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 10:29-31)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Praise the Lord that He cares so very much about us! He sees and cares for each tiny, almost unnoticed sparrow, and yet we shouldn&#8217;t have any fear because He cares for us more than <i>many</i> sparrows! Isn&#8217;t He wonderful?!</p>

<p>&#8230;&#8203;I had received <i>Dear Princess</i> when it was still being published separately, and I am still receiving it in <i>Foundation Truth.</i> Thank you for sending it to me&#8212;they have been a blessing&#8230;.</p>

<p>My main reason for writing you is to say how much I appreciated your calm response to &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_5/A_Chat_Between_Two_Friends/index.html" title="Foundation Truth 5/A Chat Between Two Friends">A Chat Between Two Friends</a>&#8221; in the last issue (Vol. 2 Issue 2). I was rather shocked that someone would say the things they did and even send it to you! I had read your &#8220;<a name="After all these" href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_3/Let_It_Not_Be_the_Outward_Adorning/?anchor=After all these#After%20all%20these" title="Foundation Truth 3/Let It Not Be the Outward Adorning">In Conclusion</a>&#8221; in the Autumn 2000 issue several times. I don&#8217;t believe it was one bit &#8220;condemning,&#8221; &#8220;cultish,&#8221; &#8220;Pharisee,&#8221; like, etc., at all! You just spoke the truth, and in love. You took no scripture out of context. In fact, everything you wrote (with the Lord&#8217;s help, I&#8217;m sure) was completely Biblical. I agreed with everything you had to say. If I had received a reply like those two girls wrote to you, I would have surely cried.</p>

<p>Like I said, I appreciated your response to them&#8230;. It is so important to truly seek God&#8217;s will until He has given us a full answer. We should be willing to give up anything the Lord may ask. It doesn&#8217;t matter if people think we are strange or weird. Aren&#8217;t we

than to &#8220;go with the flow,&#8221; and be liked and accepted by this ugly sinful world!</p>

<p>You had written,<a class="lib_ref" name="dress modestly" href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_5/A_Chat_Between_Two_Friends/?anchor=dress modestly#dress%20modestly" title="Foundation Truth 5/A Chat Between Two Friends">*</a></p>

<blockquote><p class="first">I don&#8217;t dress modestly because I feel I <i>must</i>&#8212;I don&#8217;t wear dresses because I feel the Bible teaches it and I&#8217;ll be damned otherwise. I do it out of love to Christ&#8230;. and what could seem a duty or bondage, is nothing but a love cord that binds me closer to Jesus.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>What a wonderful way to put it! That is exactly how I feel. I do it because I love Christ, and only want to serve Him more. How I want to be so in love with Jesus that I would be willing to give up anything just to draw closer to Him!</p>

<p>Far more beautiful are the eternal jewels of peace, joy, love, a quiet, gentle spirit, etc. that only Jesus can give, than the worthless temporary things of this lost world! I long to be adorned with all God&#8217;s jewels.</p>

<p>I pray the Lord will open those two girls&#8217; hearts and that they will gain understanding from Him. If
Satan can appear in the form of an angel of light (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+11%3A14">II&nbsp;Corinthians 11:14</a>),
surely he can deceive people in this area, without them realizing it. </p>

<p>May the Lord bless you for your sweet response to them. I saw no trace of revenge whatsoever. I only pray those girls take it in the right way. </p>

<p>May you ever stay close to your Savior. Keep your eyes on Him always. Thank you again for putting out <i>Dear Princess,</i> and for your response to &#8220;A Chat Between Two Friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>May the Lord bless you as you continue to seek and follow His perfect will! </p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to close with a saying I read once&#8230;.</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Abigail,</p>

<p>Hello! I am writing to renew my subscription to <i>Foundation Truth</i>. It&#8217;s hard to believe I&#8217;ve been receiving it for a year now, and <i>Dear Princess</i> before that. I really enjoy receiving it, though! I think this most recent issue was a little late in coming out and I started to wonder. I did get a little worried, especially after my friend Rachel Aston in England, to whom I introduced <i>FT</i>, told me she received it and that my letter was in the letter section. It wasn&#8217;t till a few days later that I got my issue, but I think it was well worth the wait!</p>

<p>Let me see&#8230;&#8203;in this issue you asked if anybody was reading &#8220;Princess in Calico.&#8221; Yes, please do continue to print it! I haven&#8217;t read the story before and I really like it so far!</p>

<p>What I liked most in this issue was <a href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_5/Gods_Will/index.html" title="Foundation Truth 5/God's Will">Angie LeFevre&#8217;s testimony</a> of how God has been leading her. It encouraged me so much! And it came at the perfect time, even though I&#8217;m sure I will keep going back to read it in the future. I remember Angela from an interview with DP in the first issue of DP that I received, I believe. I could really identify with her article because I finished home school high school on Sept. 19, 2001. Even now, I can scarely believe I won&#8217;t be home schooling anymore. At least I won&#8217;t be a home school student anymore. I know God&#8217;s will for me is to stay with my family and grow in the Lord. I know this is such an opportunity for me to concentrate on unique ministries, and to focus on my spiritual relationship with God. Please pray for me&#8230;.</p>

<p>I also really liked the response you wrote to the two girls&#8217; chat. I&#8217;m glad you did it in a Christ-like manner, and set the record straight, too.</p>

<p>In closing, I guess I should mention that I enjoyed all of DP and I read every single word there. (But I also read the whole magazine: i.e. the other sections too!) I look forward to the next issue and am glad to hear you&#8217;ll be reviving a few columns. And last, but not least, thanks for your ministry. I picked this card from those I have because I thought the verse was really appropriate&#8212;I do appreciate your &#8220;work of faith and labor of love.&#8221; God bless!</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>I am writing from my own experience.</p>

<p>About three years ago the Lord started talking to me about my inner sinful nature; the part of me that just got irritated when there were boxes under the furniture and things lying about in our house. I was discontent unless the house was <i>thoroughly</i> gone through and everything but the good-looking necessities were gotten rid of. I would dream of a matching set of dishes and nice dish clothes, pretty curtains, etc. Then the Lord would talk to me and say &#8220;organizing is not nearly so important as being a real help around the home.&#8221; Something within me would rebel. Basically, my favorite scripture was <span class="scripture">&#8220;Let all things be done decently and in order.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+14%3A40" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:40"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:40)</span></a></span> That was the drive in me.</p>

<p>Well, the Lord started talking to me and showed me that He had a higher life for me to live. I saw the allegory of the children of Egypt and their trip to the promised land. It was me now. I was the one that the Lord had saved from the hand of my enemy (the house of bondage&#8212;sin) and now I was nearing the Canaan Land. Would I be like the ten spies who looked at the giants instead of the power of God? I did. I told the Lord that it was &#8220;my nature&#8221; to organize and how could I change? I wanted life easy, not
&#8220;with tribulations&#8221; like the early Christians in the Bible had (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+16%3A24%3B+2+Timothy+3%3A12">Matthew 16:24; II&nbsp;Timothy 3:12</a>).
</p>

<p>Sisters, for a long time I was unwilling to give up. I prayed, but there was a part of me that held back, that said &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to let the Lord have that. If He does, then He might tell me to do something that I either can&#8217;t do or something that will just be too hard.&#8221; I had a lot of fears, and felt for a while that God was asking too much. Looking back, I can see how good the Lord was to me. When I went and prayed, sometimes I would think that if I prayed enough&#8230;&#8203;maybe two hours or even four, then God would surely answer my needs (the devil accused me of not seeking sanctification hard enough). When I listened to him the result was confusion and despair. Once I vowed to the Lord that I wouldn&#8217;t eat any lunch. I thought that would show Him that I was in earnest. Oh, if only I had looked up then and saw how
compassionate the Lord was (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalms+51%3A16-17">Psalms 51:16-17</a>).
The result of that was that it only put me into greater discouragement. During this time I started getting a picture of the Lord as one who is a stern, hard master, hardhearted, and void of true love. Oh, no, I wouldn&#8217;t admit that out loud, but that is what it seemed like. But one day the Lord in His mercy showed me that Sanctification was a &#8220;gift.&#8221; He wanted to freely <i>give</i> it in His timing. A <i>gift</i>&#8212;He wasn&#8217;t forcing it on me. That was hard to grasp, but it helped me in further battles. The devil, seeing my sincerity, really tried to accuse me a lot. I believe he tries this on any sincere heart. Finally, I felt like I had given all that I knew of to the Lord and had given to Him all He had shown me. I prayed asking for faith to get the answer. It didn&#8217;t come. I kept on praying.</p>

<p>Finally one Sunday morning the Lord dealt very strongly with my soul about getting sanctified. The devil was there also; and I hadn&#8217;t learned just to ignore him, so I was quite beaten down. The devil told me that unless I broke in at the middle of service and asked for people to 
lay hands on me and pray for me (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+19%3A6">Acts 19:6</a>),
I would displease the Lord. So I was burdened all the service and felt so bad because I didn&#8217;t have the so-called &#8220;obedience&#8221; to speak up. Later before lunch I asked my dad to come (understand, I am a quite timid person naturally) and asked him to see if he, Mommy, and some others would all pray for me to get sanctified. It was a hard thing to do. The pastor asked if I felt like I was all clear between me and God. I thought and a few things came to mind. We prayed about them until I felt that all was clear. Then different ones prayed for me. They prayed asking God to send down his Holy Spirit as He had promised. Nothing changed. I felt kind of desperate. Then I decided to pray. I told the Lord that all that I wanted to do was please Him, and that I had given up all I knew how and as far as I knew I was clear before Him. I then claimed His promise,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. If a son shall ask bread of any one of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+11%3A9-13" title="Luke 11:9-13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 11:9-13)</span></a></span>
I finished my prayer with my usual &#8220;and I&#8217;ll thank You for it.&#8221; Everyone that heard me thought I said, &#8220;and I thank You for it.&#8221; They were so glad. And then, all at once, I had a peace in my heart and I knew right then and there that the Lord <i>had</i> answered and my sacrifice was accepted. I was <i>so</i> happy! I couldn&#8217;t keep from smiling.</p>

<p>Oh, sisters, the Lord does answer prayer. It may take a while. When I prayed it took quite a few months. But He <i>does</i> answer. And with the answer, He&#8217;ll give you joy that will be far more than worth the earnest seeking.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For <b>every one</b> that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh <i>findeth</i>; and to him that knocketh it <b>shall be opened</b>.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+11%3A10" title="Luke 11:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 11:10)</span></a></span>
No matter what the devil tells you, don&#8217;t listen to him. He is your enemy. Set your will to give all to God. Ask Him to show you what you need to give up&#8212;don&#8217;t listen to what the devil has to say. When as far as you know you&#8217;ve given up all you know, commit it to Him. Keep on asking. If He doesn&#8217;t answer right away don&#8217;t give up. He knows what He&#8217;s doing. He loves <i>you</i>, never doubt that. Keep asking. If He delays, then it&#8217;s for the best. The devil&#8217;s target is those who earnestly want to live for God, especially when we are waiting for something from God. He either wants us to forget to ask or to get discouraged when it takes a while and lose hope.</p>

<p>Be encouraged, sisters: I want your best and you can be sure if I want your best the Lord wants it a lot more. He loves you with an <span class="scripture">&#8220;everlasting love.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+31%3A3" title="Jeremiah 31:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jeremiah 31:3)</span></a></span> When our feelings say it or when they are all against it, when our circumstances are for it or against it&#8212;He just keeps on loving us. Remember how, when the spies first went to Canaan, they brought back the fruit of the land. It was a cluster of grapes so big that two grown men had to carry it. Ask God to give you some of the fruits of the Canaan land so that you will be able to have the courage to press out for it. Remember,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+31%3A6" title="Deuteronomy 31:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Deuteronomy 31:6)</span></a></span>
God is able to give that strength and courage to you. We are praying for you.</p>

<p class="signature">With love,<br />Your sister in Christ</p>

<h1>Cleora&#8217;s Purse</h1>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">How much is a dollar really worth?</p>
</div>


<blockquote>
<p class="first">I sat busily writing one Monday morning. My little daughter, a child of seven, came into the room prepared for school. Evidently she had something on her mind, some very important request. That was made plain by the twist of her small body, and the very persuasive smile on her sweet, young face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, did you notice that beautiful purse that Marguerite had at church yesterday?&#8221; she asked. I had noticed it, for Cleora had held it really all through the service. &#8220;I think it is the most beautiful purse I ever saw. It is just the right size for a little girl. Mother, I want a purse like that,&#8221; she said eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a nice little purse, and I suspect it cost a dollar,&#8221; I said with a little warning in my voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, you always like to get me things that make me happy, and a purse like that will make me happier than anything I could have. A dollar isn&#8217;t much, Mother, and I want it so much,&#8221; she pleaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;La, la,&#8221; I said to myself, &#8220;a dollar isn&#8217;t much! You shall learn, my little girl, how much a dollar is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot buy you a purse at once,&#8221; I said thoughtfully, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll tell you what I will do: I will make a plan that gives you certain things to do each day, and every day you do them without being told I will give you a penny, not for pay, but as a reward for being thoughtful. And, on Saturday, if you have got a penny every day since the Saturday before, I will give you a dime as a reward for being thoughtful for a whole week. But each day that you forget to do your work, you must give me a penny, and on Saturday you will not get your dime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you dear, dear Mother! I knew you would let me have my purse. I have three pennies already, and I shall soon have a dollar. I want my new purse to wear with my new dress next Sunday,&#8221; said the happy child.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, child, do not expect to have your purse by Sunday. But on Saturday we shall go down and find the purse you want and price it, so that you will know just what you are working for,&#8221; I said encouragingly.</p>

<p>That was in April. In August she came to me saying, &#8220;Mother, I have decided not to buy a purse. A dollar seems to be such a lot of money. If I may have my money I can buy something else with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dear,&#8221; I said quietly, &#8220;I am sure you want a purse as much as you ever did, only you are tired of working for it. Let us go on and finish what we have begun. That purse will seem all the nicer when you get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a sunny day in October when there were one hundred little brown pennies in the little box she kept them in, and we could go down and buy the purse. &#8220;What a lot of money a dollar is!&#8221; she said wonderingly as she looked at her treasured store. Oh, the toil of earning that money! Many the day that something was forgotten, and she had grudgingly gone to her little savings and brought me a penny forfeit, and too few the Saturdays when a bright silver dime went into the box. But the dollar was at last all there.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the look of triumph with which she carried off her precious purse, nor the pride with which she exhibited it to her friends with the boast, &#8220;It cost a whole dollar, and I earned it myself,&#8221; and perhaps the added remark, &#8220;A whole dollar is a lot of money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Never did I hear her say again that a dollar was not much, and from that time forward we could talk sensibly together about the prices of things we wished to buy. She learned early how much a dollar is.</p>

<p>This story may not seem to apply to many young girls without families and children of their own. In our age-segregated society, we often read only things that seem to meet the present need. Young people are making decisions about college, jobs, ministries, courtships/companions for life. Naturally that&#8217;s what they want to hear about. But in a few years, these decisions will be behind them. Others will take their place: how do you ever get enough money to put a down payment on a home while raising a family? How do you make the grocery bill stretch? How can you get quality clothing on an already tight budget? (Even if you can sew dress reasonably, little boys&#8217; overalls are so expensive!) How do you satisfy your children&#8217;s &#8220;wants,&#8221; and subdue the natural greediness mentality? These questions and hundreds more will come flooding in just a few years. There is so much we don&#8217;t know. Surely it would be wise to learn as much as possible in the time of youth!</p>

<p>As a child, I was naturally a very greedy &#8220;wanter&#8221;&#8212;especially for dolls. Every baby was beautiful&#8212;and needed me for a mother. My parents had quite a time subduing my spendthrift desires. My wants were usually quite expensive (well over a dollar!), and I had no idea of the value of money. Setting about to teach me, they had me work to earn whatever I wanted. At five years old, I wanted a baby doll that cost $45. It took me two years to earn it, by washing dishes at 20 cents a stack, and other odd jobs, but I did it, and am here to say, that &#8220;Roseanna&#8221; was one of my most treasured and valued childhood possessions. I loved my other dolls, but somehow Roseanna was special. Other dolls and toys got a head full of scratches and became worn out from carelessness, but Roseanna is still in good shape today.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t do our children any favor by giving in to their every want. I did not get every doll I saw. (My bedroom would have been nothing else!) Too many times, I see parents, busy with work and laden with guilt, shove materialistic things at their children to compensate. Aside from the fact that children want Mamma and Daddy, not toys, this wrecks their ability to appreciate toys because of the abundance of gifts. It gives them absolutely no sense of value; it also creates the selfish view that the world owes them a living. I often see children, aged eight, nine, or ten, who are so greedy, it is incredible. I think, &#8220;My, how in world did they ever get to be so thoughtless?&#8221; But when I remember their parents, it all makes sense&#8212;their parents foster the natural greed, thinking that was love, and it just took off from there.</p>

<p>A couple years ago, we purchased our eight-year-old an American Girl doll: Felicity. We hoped the historical aspect would encourage her to become more interested in history and reading. Her mother had let the television raise her until age five (when we found her), and she had been struggling to have enough imagination to play normally. We hoped this would help. Along with that we purchased a few other accessories, knowing that she needed all the props she could get. We prepared her over a number of months after first introducing the idea, hoping the value would increase in her as the wait lengthened. And we were delighted with how she responded when the coveted doll came at last. She played with her as I encouraged, and began to act more like a little girl than a television mimic. And then came the day I found Felicity outside on a swing, right where she had been left the night before. I marched inside where I met a horrified little girl. For yes, it had rained last night. Felicity, the $89 dollar doll, had spent a soaking night. We managed to restore the doll to her almost new condition, except for one thing. The almost life-like hair was much rougher, very coarse, though still manageable. Was it possible to teach children to value their things?</p>

<p>Months later, she approached me with the American Girl catalog in hand and desired to have an item to go with Felicity. I examined it. Did she need it? It would probably enhance her play (which she needed). Was it within a reasonable price? It wasn&#8217;t that bad, for the quality of the item. I considered the pros and cons.</p>

<p>We pay the children for odd jobs they do&#8212;not their own responsibilities, such as feeding their rabbits, but for extra help in the garden, or washing dishes other than their own. I knew she had some money. So we counted and found she had about $1 in change. It was agreed she could buy the item desired when she had earned the amount. We roughly set a goal for $20, since most things in that catalog were about that price. Months went by. She saved and saved. Many times she wanted to buy this or that small item. We reinforced over and over that she could spend all her money on little things or save it all for one nice item. At the beginning of this December, she came to me with shining eyes and her little box full with $20 of green bills and change. We looked through the catalog with her, discussing each item together. The thing she most desired was a horse for Felicity. It stood almost two feet high, was in right proportion to her doll, and had beautiful, quality hair and features. I knew it was the thing she would probably use the most with her doll. However, the price was three times the price she had saved.</p>

<p>It was almost Christmas. The children looked forward to giving to and receiving gifts from each other at that time. I hadn&#8217;t really had something in mind for her, so we asked her if she wanted the horse enough for it to be all her Christmas present as well as the thing she earned. She had to think about that one for awhile. I knew she looked forward to opening presents with the rest, but she was old enough (almost ten) to make her decision. Finally she decided, and together we ordered her horse! A week went by and the package came while she was at school. I put it away and had to become quite clever at answering her questions as to when the horse would arrive. Finally the day came when we celebrated Christmas. When Richelle opened the large package, her eyes nearly popped out of her head! The horse was so lifelike in every feature; it was quite incredible. Delicate, long hair blended beautifully with a penny-colored coat. She was quite fascinated, to be sure!</p>

<p>I watched carefully to see how she would treat her new possession. Would this be like her Felicity doll&#8212;loved, but not entirely valued? It was not. With utmost care she placed her horse back into the Styrofoam packing and box when she finished playing, and does so each time. She is careful to keep the box away from the little ones&#8217; play areas. This done, and no coaching from me! A few days ago, I allowed her to have a couple of girls over to play for an hour or so. When she brought out her horse, I heard her say, &#8220;We have to be careful with Penny, because she is very valuable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Training pays off! Maybe we don&#8217;t see the results right away, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t worth it.</p>
