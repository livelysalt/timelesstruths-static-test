<h1>The Decorated Dollhouse</h1>

<p>&#8220;Mommy, come look at our doll house,&#8221; chorused the two happy little girls as they heard mother&#8217;s footsteps coming down the hall. Mother set down her basket of clothes and stepped into the bedroom to enter into their world of learning and see what they had made, or how they had arranged their rooms this time.</p>

<p>To mother&#8217;s surprise they had found a tiny green and white trim among the craft supplies, and had put it all around the door and windows of the doll house. There was also a tiny tree in the house with the trim draped around it. It was a marvelous discovery in the world of miniature houses! It was very beautiful! But mother&#8217;s heart was not at ease. As mother went back to her work, she prayed for the Lord&#8217;s guidance in this matter. They had never put up Christmas lights, as they did not want to join in with the way the world celebrated Christ&#8217;s birth. Nor had they ever had a Christmas tree in their home. Why? Didn&#8217;t Jeremiah the prophet say,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Hear ye the word which the Lord speaketh unto you, O house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them. For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe. They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+10%3A1-4" title="Jeremiah 10:1-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jeremiah 10:1-4)</span></a></span>
The Lord continued talking to the mother in faithfulness, and so the first woman, Eve, came to mind, and how the second step to her disobedience was in the fact that &#8220;she looked&#8221; at the forbidden fruit.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+3%3A6" title="Genesis 3:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 3:6)</span></a></span>
The Lord also said, &#8220;Do you remember the uneasy feeling in your heart when you and your husband would drive by that most magnificent, dazzling show of Christmas lights on the homes built around the lake?&#8221; It was a huge attraction every year. Hundreds of cars would drive by this area to view the creativity of the homeowners. Beautiful things draw the eye. The devil understands this and ensnares many people by this means. How we need to be aware and listen to the gentle pricks of the Holy Spirit warning us of danger.</p>

<p>How small the seed starts! How sly of our enemy to use our eyes to desire things. No wonder the Word says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Keep thy heart with all diligence.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+4%3A23" title="Proverbs 4:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 4:23)</span></a></span>
I really had not desired those things as we drove around looking at them. And I remember very well the thought, should we really be doing this? We don&#8217;t want to give the devil any room in our hearts. Don&#8217;t let him have the first step. Don&#8217;t listen to him—which was Eve&#8217;s first mistake toward disobedience.</p>

<p>The thoughtful mother saw her duty toward her children and how she could not allow them to play like they had Christmas lights on their dollhouse and please the Lord. Wouldn&#8217;t this be the devil&#8217;s plan to build up desire in their eyes? It would hide the true riches from them. She then went into her little girls&#8217; room and shared the thoughts the Lord had given.</p>

<p>They had first made some curtains out of fabric scraps. When they wearied of that, the devil had suggested to pretend this doll house family was an unsaved family. Then their imagination grew and they began decorating for Christmas. But they willingly took it all down. Mother gave them a tiny nativity scene so this doll house family could remember Christ&#8217;s birthday in a way that would honor the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>Mothers, may the Lord guide you in the watch you are keeping over the little ones He has placed in your care. May they grow up to be trees of righteousness, a planting of the Lord.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Song+of+Solomon+2%3A15" title="Song of Solomon 2:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Song of Solomon 2:15)</span></a></span>
