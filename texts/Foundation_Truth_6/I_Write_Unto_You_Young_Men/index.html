<h1>&#8220;I Write Unto You, Young Men&#8221;</h1>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first"><span class="scripture">&#8220;I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+2%3A14" title="I&nbsp;John 2:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 2:14)</span></a></span></p>
</div>


<hr class="minor" />
<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+1%3A5" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 1:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 1:5)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Brother Paul is speaking to Timothy here in preparation for an exhortation to boldness and courage. The foundation he builds on is &#8220;the unfeigned faith&#8221; which he saw in Timothy. If that wasn&#8217;t there, then being exhorted to boldness and courage would be useless! Unfeigned means simply that it is real and sincere. As I look around in the scriptures, I see that this faith is laid as a foundation. 
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+11%3A6" title="Hebrews 11:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 11:6)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+6%3A29" title="John 6:29"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 6:29)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death into life.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+5%3A24" title="John 5:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 5:24)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+10%3A9" title="Romans 10:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 10:9)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Now if this is indeed the key to both starting and finishing the race for heaven, and if there is indeed a war for men&#8217;s destinies waged between God and the devil, then it becomes apparent that this very thing is hotly disputed ground. It is in the devil&#8217;s interest to obscure themeaning of it, lead people away from it, convince people who have it that they don&#8217;t, and convince those that don&#8217;t have it that they do. Basically, the devil will use any strategy and tactic that men use in human warfare to prevent us from obtaining and maintaining this faith (without any regard for &#8220;fairness&#8221; or &#8220;honor,&#8221; for the devil does not limit himself in that way at all). Indeed, our only hope to &#8220;gain this ground,&#8221; is the determination to get from God the help needed no matter what it takes. And this very thing God is most willing to do. My prayer is that the remaining thoughts here might be useful in God&#8217;s hands to send help to some who need it in this area.</p>

<p>In its simplest sense, faith is believing something to be so. But how do we know if we actually believe something to be so? In the play &#8220;Fiddler on the Roof,&#8221; a scene occurs where Tevye, the lead character, is listening to two people arguing. First, he says to the one, &#8220;You know, you&#8217;re right!&#8221; The other speaks, contradicting the first, and Tevye says to him in turn, &#8220;You know, you&#8217;re right!&#8221; Then the first speaker, with some frustration, says: &#8220;I&#8217;m right! He&#8217;s right! How can we both be right?&#8221; To which, Tevye, after pondering a moment, replies: &#8220;You know, you&#8217;re right!&#8221; Faith is a persuasion. It believes when the opposition has had its say, as well. It is not faith when it simply holds to what has most recently been stated.</p>

<p>Faith is also something that demonstrates itself in action. In the late 1800&#8217;s, in a small town, the story is told of a noted infidel there, who stated again and again, in (apparently) convincing terms that there was no God. One day his wagon overturned on a lonely road, pinning him underneath it. He was conscious, but trapped, with no likely prospect of help. Another man came by after some time, and heard, from under this wagon, the sound of loud, earnest prayer to God for help. The infidel&#8217;s faith that there was no God was not strong enough to demonstrate itself in this crisis! It becomes evident that it was rather a preference than a conviction.</p>

<p>Faith is based on knowledge and experience, although it reaches beyond it. A famous daredevil tightrope walker had arranged to walk a tightrope across the Niagara river, just above Niagara Falls. Before crossing, he spoke to the crowd, asking them if they believed he could do it. They responded that they did. He &#8220;worked&#8221; them thus a little bit, until they were wildly cheering that they believed, not only that he could do it, but that he could carry someone across on his shoulders. Then he asked for a volunteer to ride across on his shoulders. Dead silence. Finally, his agent volunteered (with some trepidation), and was taken across safely. The agent had some experience with this man, but had to reach beyond it, placing his safety in his hands.</p>

<p>We see these elements in the passage in Hebrews, and in several &#8220;pieces.&#8221; We first must believe God exists, then we must believe He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. Developing such a faith can perhaps start from seeing others rewarded, but must finally extend to becoming a diligent seeker ourselves. This diligent seeking must press through the obstacles, exercising and becoming stronger until it stands ready to pay the great price. What great price? Consider this: 
<span class="scripture">&#8220;&#8230;&#8203;and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+10%3A9" title="Romans 10:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 10:9)</span></a></span>
The death we must believe Jesus was raised from was needful because of us. Death to our pride, death to our self-sufficiency, death to our sense of being &#8220;ok&#8221; and endeavoring to manage on our own. The life to which Jesus was raised is as King and Lord of all. Submission to a new master, with all things in subjection to Him. Faith resulting in action, extending beyond experience, standing without outer props. Faith that pursues until the reward is obtained&#8212;the new heart, sins forgiven and all things made new.</p>

<p>My prayer for you is that you would, by the help of God, maintain this &#8220;unfeigned faith&#8221; if you have it, and recognize if you do not have it and seek until you obtain.</p>
