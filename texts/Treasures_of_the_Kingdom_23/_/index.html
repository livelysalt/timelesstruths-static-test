<h1>Freely Give</h1>

<p>Knock, knock, knock! Rosie stood beside her mother in front of the big, gray door and listened. Yes, Mrs. Walker was in. As the slow shuffling of feet came near, Rosie clutched the basket in her hand and smiled in excitement. Mama had packed it with strawberry jam, fresh bread, and a card for the elderly neighbor.</p>

<p>The door opened and a sad face peered out at them. &#8220;I knew you haven&#8217;t been well, so we brought you a little something,&#8221; Mother said, cheerily. Mrs. Walker smiled a little as Rosie held out the basket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do come in,&#8221; she said in a quavery voice. &#8220;My rheumatism&#8217;s been awful bad and I can hardly get about. Do come in, for it is so nice to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosie followed her mother into the kitchen and set the basket on the counter. There were dishes piled into the sink and crumbs on the floor. The smell of rotten apples came from a box in the corner and Rosie wrinkled her nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t been able to keep things up,&#8221; Mrs. Walker muttered as she shuffled over. &#8220;You made the bread, dear? How nice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother had been baking all morning, but she only said, &#8220;And the children made the card.&#8221; Then she looked around at the dirty room and turned to Rosie. &#8220;Could you run home and bring back our cleaning kit, dear?&#8221; Rosie nodded and was off in a flash.</p>

<p>Mrs. Walker was sitting in her easy chair when Rosie came back. Mama was fixing her something to drink. &#8220;Rosie, would you please dust around the living room a bit?&#8221; she asked, as Rosie lugged the kit into the kitchen. &#8220;I&#8217;ll just clean up these dishes and sweep the floor.&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_23/give_cleaning.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="220" /></div>
<p>It was fun cleaning house for someone else for once. Rosie ran the cloth over the side table and lamp. Mrs. Walker was shutting her eyes, so she tried to be as quiet as a mouse. She dusted the shelves carefully. They were full of pictures and books and little glass bells. One bell rang as Rosie lifted it and the old lady opened her eyes. Rosie smiled and Mrs. Walker said, &#8220;How sweet of you, honey, to be so helpful like that.&#8221; Rosie went on dusting, and humming as she went.</p>

<p>When Rosie had finished shining the windows, Mrs. Walker called to her. &#8220;Honey child, can you reach that cupboard there? Just take down that box of chocolates. I want you to have them for being such a good helper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you!&#8221; Rosie said, smiling brightly as she held the little box. It was covered with red and yellow roses and inside there were eight pieces of chocolate. She shut the lid carefully and tucked it under her arm to take home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to share them with everyone at supper?&#8221; Mother asked as they walked down the sidewalk together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Rosie. She had never had a box of chocolates all to herself before. &#8220;Maybe I&#8217;ll save them for sometime special.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a very kind gift of Mrs. Walker. You may do what you want with them.&#8221; Mother smiled, but it was a tired sort of smile.</p>

<p>They were on the front porch now and Rosie burst through the door. Irene was sweeping in the kitchen and as Rosie darted past toward her room there was a loud <i>CRASH</i>!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do be careful!&#8221; Irene cried. Rosie turned to see Mama&#8217;s pot of African violets smashed on the floor. Mother stood in the doorway, but she wasn&#8217;t smiling now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8212;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; Rosie said, looking down. Mother set down the cleaning kit and knelt to lift the broken plant from the floor. It didn&#8217;t look very bad, Rosie thought, but the floor was a mess. &#8220;I&#8217;ll clean up,&#8221; she said quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look tired,&#8221; Irene added. &#8220;Just go rest, Mama. And Rosie, you watch the little ones while I sweep up.&#8221; So Mother sat down in the easy chair and Rosie quietly put her chocolates away. Emma and Kyle wanted to see what she had gotten, but Rosie told them to wait until later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go outside awhile,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not too cold.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_23/give_hug.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="260" /></div>
<p>&#8220;But I want Mama to read to me,&#8221; said Emma, pulling out her favorite book. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you Mama? Please?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she&#8217;s tired,&#8221; Rosie said quickly.</p>

<p>Mother opened her eyes and held out her hand. &#8220;Not too tired for my little Precious. I&#8217;ve been busy all day, haven&#8217;t I? I think we can read a little while now.&#8221; Emma crawled up on her lap and snuggled close.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you get tired of me?&#8221; she asked, patting Mama&#8217;s cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dear. God has given me my strength and time, and I&#8217;m glad to spend it for my family. That&#8217;s what mothers are for. Take Kyle out for a little if you want, dear,&#8221; she said to Rosie.</p>

<p><i>That&#8217;s what mothers are for,</i> Rosie repeated to herself, as she pushed her little brother on the swing. She thought of how patient her mother was. <i>And Irene, too. I&#8217;ll try to be more helpful and kind,</i> Rosie thought. <i>I&#8217;m really sorry I broke the flower pot. Maybe I can buy Mama a new one.</i></p>

<p>Now Kyle wanted to play with his toy cars on the slide. Zoom, zoom, zoom! Rosie was thinking of how much money she had saved when suddenly Kyle burst into tears. His favorite car was missing and Rosie couldn&#8217;t find it anywhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go inside now,&#8221; she said at last. It was getting dark and Kyle&#8217;s little hand felt cold in hers. He was still sad about the lost car when she helped him wash his hands. &#8220;It will be okay, buddy,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You can play with your truck inside now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosie was reaching up for her money jar when she saw the chocolate box. Now she knew why it had been given to her. <i>God let me get it to share. That&#8217;s what chocolates are for.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Kyle, come here,&#8221; she called. His little feet came padding into the room. &#8220;This is the special box I got today from Mrs. Walker. It has chocolates in it,&#8221; she said, opening the lid. &#8220;Shall we take it to the table so everyone can have a piece for supper?&#8221;</p>

<p>The happy look on Kyle&#8217;s face was reward enough for Rosie.</p>

<h1>For a Purpose</h1>

<p>Do you like to ask questions? I do. I want to learn and find out. I want to know &#8220;why?&#8221; Why did the phone ring? Why are you cutting those apples? Why do I have freckles? What is the reason or purpose for it? That is a good question.</p>

<p>God made the world and all that is in it for a reason. He made us on purpose. When I do something &#8220;on purpose,&#8221; I have a plan and a reason to do it. God has a plan and a reason for us. He wants us to walk with Him and be with Him, just like Jesus was. But you have a choice to cooperate and do God&#8217;s will or not. God doesn&#8217;t make us love Him and follow Him.</p>

<p>Do you want to take God&#8217;s way? It is much better than always trying to fight what He wants you to do. If you ask God, He can show you His purpose for things. Just like how Rosie found that it was happiest to share her chocolates. When you are sick or upset or troubled you can ask the Lord why. He lets us have trouble on purpose so that we will listen and obey Him. Just like Mom and Dad have to discipline you on purpose so that you will do what is right.</p>

<p>God is a good Heavenly Father, and all His purposes are good. When things go well or they don&#8217;t, take it all to Him. He made you for a purpose. Live your life for God!</p>

<h1>Snipped Off</h1>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_23/snipped_cutters.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="160" /></div>
<p>For our science lesson today let&#8217;s visit the King&#8217;s orchard. Pull on your mittens, for it is frosty and cold outside. It is a gray day and all the tree branches are smooth and bare, but there is the gardener up on a ladder! Nothing is growing, so what could he be doing?</p>

<p>Come closer and watch. Snip, snip, snip. Long, thin branches are falling to the ground all around the tree. Snip, snip! &#8220;Why are you cutting them off?&#8221; you ask.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you want good apples, then the trees have to be pruned in the winter,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I am pruning off all the weak and crooked branches so that the tree will be strong. See, here.&#8221; We watch as he snips along a branch. It looks like it is getting a haircut!</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it hurt the tree?&#8221; you want to know.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_23/snipped_twig.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="240" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Not too much. It helps the tree bear apples and not a lot of leaves. If I left it to itself, it would grow bushy and only have small fruits,&#8221; he tells us. &#8220;When it gets cut short, it spends time growing the right way. Just like children that need to be trained to do what is right,&#8221; he says with a smile.</p>

<p>You pick up a fallen twig and look at all the little buds just starting to form. &#8220;Now these can&#8217;t grow into flowers, can they?&#8221; you ask.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, because those are only leaf buds,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Twigs think they need lots of leaves, but they don&#8217;t. Just like you think you know best, but mother doesn&#8217;t let you have your own way. If your parents love you, they will correct you and stop you from doing things that are wrong.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_23/snipped_tree.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="210" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Like you snip off twigs?&#8221; You look at stubby tree branches. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem very much like it helps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe not now,&#8221; the gardener says, taking down his ladder. &#8220;But if this tree responds like it should, these bare branches will be covered with pink blossoms in the spring. And if you trust and obey when you are corrected, I think we will see a happy child growing in the right way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you hear about the plane crash, Grandpa?&#8221; Edward asked, bursting into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;And a lot of people died,&#8221; said Sammy. &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that bad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It can be bad, but if we love God He can work those things for good,&#8221; Grandpa said. Then he leaned back and said, &#8220;Do you want to hear another true story? I will call it&#8212;</p>

<h1>The Way of Escape</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+2">Matthew 2</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">There lived in Bethlehem two children, whom I will call Amon and Jerusha. It was the year of the Roman taxing and Father&#8217;s smith shop bustled with strangers. All day Amon helped Father in the shop and Jerusha watched the baby Meshak or ran errands for Mother. Every evening Father gathered the family to read the Scriptures. The children loved the stories about Moses and God leading His people.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Lord has promised to send us the Messiah,&#8221; Father would say. &#8220;He will be our Prince, and He will be born in Bethlehem.&#8221; Many stories were told of His coming, but the strangest one Amon heard as he opened shop one morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;James, the shepherd boy, said that he saw the Savior. He was born last night and is lying in a manger back of the inn!&#8221; he told Jerusha. &#8220;He said angels in bright robes sang to them on the hillside. Do you think it is true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let us go see,&#8221; Jerusha said. &#8220;Who knows? Moses came in a basket boat, remember?&#8221; They hurried through the crowded inn yard and out back to the stable. He was there, sleeping quietly when his mother lifted the blanket for them to peek in. They walked home quietly, wondering. Could this baby really be the Messiah?</p>

<p>Days and weeks passed, and the strangers settled in a house down the street. Then one day Jerusha saw a procession of camels come into town. She and Amon watched as it stopped in front of the stranger&#8217;s house! Several richly dressed men got down with great excitement and went inside. &#8220;Why have you come?&#8221; Amon asked a servant boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;To see the King of the Jews&#8212;we followed his star all the way here,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Amon and Jerusha looked at each other with surprise. What did this mean?</p>

<p>&#8220;A King for us?&#8221; Mother doubted. &#8220;He is such a little boy, only the size of Meshak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is the Savior, as the shepherds said,&#8221; Father said confidently. &#8220;What was the angel&#8217;s song? &#8216;Peace on earth, good will to men!&#8217; He is our Prince of Peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the talk of Bethlehem for several days, and everyone was filled with excitement. That is, until the day King Herod&#8217;s soldiers marched into town.</p>

<p>What horrible things happened then! Jerusha heard the screams. &#8220;They are killing the babies&#8212;all of them under two years old!&#8221; the inn-keeper&#8217;s wife cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, oh, why?!&#8221; Mother clung to little Meshak, but they snatched him away.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re after the baby King&#8212;I heard them say so,&#8221; Amon cried, amid the wailing. The baby King? Jerusha was off running up the street, her heart pounding. How could God let this happen to them? If this was the promised Messiah&#8212;the words stuck in her throat as she pounded on their door. The house was empty.</p>

<p>But they haven&#8217;t got Him, Jerusha thought. A ray of gladness came to her heart then. God was bigger than all those terrible things&#8212;He hadn&#8217;t let them get caught. And in her sadness Jerusha knew that the Prince of Peace had come. She must tell the others. The God that kept Him safe could take care of them now.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>&#8220;Ohhh,&#8221; said Sammy with a sigh. &#8220;How sad that was!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it when sad things happen like that,&#8221; Alice said, leaning against Grandpa&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;But God took care of Jesus,&#8221; said Edward. &#8220;He warned them to escape at night, didn&#8217;t He?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Grandpa. &#8220;God did take care of them. And even when all those families lost their little babies, don&#8217;t you think God still cared?&#8221;</p>

<p>The children were quiet, and finally Alice said, &#8220;How? It seemed so terrible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But terrible things happen to everyone,&#8221; said Grandpa. &#8220;He is our Prince of Peace because He has promised to never forsake us, that He is bigger than the terrible things. When everything goes wrong, God is still there to care for us and help us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s bigger than anything, especially mean old King Herod!&#8221; said Edward.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad,&#8221; said Sammy, snuggling close under Grandpa&#8217;s arm.</p>

<h1>The Hard Way</h1>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_23/hard_father.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Frank, I have one more errand for you; then you may go and play the rest of the afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Father, thanks. What is it you want me to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Frank&#8217;s father went behind the counter and drew out a little drawer. The man handed his son a silver dollar and said: &#8220;You may carry this to Widow Boardman. Be careful not to lose it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be careful,&#8221; promised Frank, and then went out the door.</p>

<p>It was the first day of vacation. The boy felt happy as he trudged along the road. He was thinking of the good days ahead&#8212;two weeks and no school! Perhaps the pleasant day, the fresh air, and the sunlight had something to do with making him happy. Something else helped to make Frank happy, although he was not thinking about it. He had tried his best to do right. It makes a wonderful difference when we know we are doing our best.</p>

<p>Mrs. Boardman lived some distance up the road. Frank had already passed the schoolhouse, and the little pond, and was passing the willow grove, when suddenly he decided to make a whistle to blow along the way. So, putting the dollar in his jacket pocket, he climbed over the fence and cut several willow twigs. He went along with the twigs in his hand, until he reached a log lying on a grass spot by the roadside. Here he sat down and made two whistles. They sounded wonderful to Frank&#8217;s ears.</p>

<p>As he shut the widow&#8217;s gate, Frank put his hand in his pocket to take out the dollar, so that he might have it ready to hand to her when she came to the door. It was not there. Thinking he had felt in the wrong pocket, he put his hand in the other, fully expecting to feel the dollar between his fingers. It was not there.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_23/hard_frank.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="280" /></div>
<p>Frank felt alarmed. Could he have lost it? He searched carefully in every pocket, but the dollar was lost. He turned around and went slowly back, looking carefully along the road for the lost dollar. He searched around the log, in the willow grove, by the roadside, every step of the way, but no dollar was to be seen. He went over the road again with no better success. At length he sat down upon the log to consider what he should do.</p>

<p>The dollar was lost, there was no doubt of that. His father had told him to be careful, and he had not been. Now what should he do? His first thought was to go back to the store and tell his father all about it. This would be the right way; but he disliked to go, for he knew his father would blame him for his carelessness.</p>

<p>Frank decided he would not go to his father then. He would go and play with the boys awhile. Perhaps his father would never know. At any rate he would not tell him at once. So he got up from the log and walked slowly toward the schoolhouse playground. Soon he was playing with the boys.</p>

<p>In the evening Frank went home and sat down at the supper table with the family. Soon after the blessing had been said, while his brothers and sisters were talking with each other about what they had been doing through the day, Father turned to him and said: &#8220;Oh, Frank, did you carry the dollar to Mrs. Boardman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; answered Frank promptly.</p>

<p>The question was asked so suddenly that he had no time to make up his mind what to answer. He felt less like telling the truth than he had at first. It seemed too hard. He thought to take the easier way by answering &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The easier way! Poor boy, he had not learned yet that it was the hard way.</p>

<p>Soon after supper Frank went upstairs to bed. When he said his evening prayer he did not feel that God was listening to him, and he passed a restless night.</p>

<p>In the morning he woke up to find the sun shining into his room. Leaping out of bed in high spirits, he began to dress. Suddenly he thought of the lost dollar, and this blotted out all his happy feelings.</p>

<p>The day went by slowly. Frank was troubled by the fear that Father would find out about the lost dollar; yet he found it harder every hour to make up his mind to tell what had happened.</p>

<p>In the evening Frank could endure it no longer. The easy way had indeed become the hard way. While sitting in the front room he made up his mind to go and tell the matter. He started toward the study, where his father was. Every step in the right direction gave him new strength. He opened the study door and came to the table where his father sat writing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Frank,&#8221; Father said kindly, &#8220;what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Father,&#8221; said the boy, but he could not go on. He bowed his head upon the table and sobbed.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Frank raised his head, and began again: &#8220;I want to tell you Father&#8221;&#8212;but it was too much.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, Frank. Let me tell you first,&#8221; said Father. &#8220;You want to tell me that you did not carry the dollar to Mrs. Boardman, that you lost it on the way, that last night you told a lie about it, and you felt wretched all the time. You wanted to tell me, but you did not dare. Is that it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; sobbed Frank.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wanted to take a way easier than the right way, yet you have found it a great deal harder.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frank knew that was true. He saw that he might have spared himself a great deal of uneasiness and sorrow by choosing the right way.</p>

<p>To help Frank remember, it was decided he should earn a dollar as soon as he could and take it to Mrs. Boardman. Frank set about earning his dollar, and before vacation was over, he carried it with a light heart to Mrs. Boardman.</p>

<p>The strangest part of the whole matter was that while Frank was returning from Mrs. Boardman&#8217;s his shoe struck something hard. He looked down and saw the dollar he had lost!</p>

<h1>On Your Guard</h1>

<p class="noindent">Young Soldier,</p>

<p>Do you want to be on guard when I come? Take heed and watch. Watch that you are obeying the orders I give you. Wear your armor. Most of all, watch that your steps stay in the right way.</p>

<p>If you come to a choice in the road, there is a right way to take and a wrong way. What if you take just one step in the wrong way? Maybe you don&#8217;t think it will be that bad, but take heed! Don&#8217;t take the first step.</p>

<p>One little lie makes a liar. One thing stolen makes a thief. What if others are doing it? Don&#8217;t follow bad examples! If you take one step in the wrong, if you disobey only once, it will be harder to do the right thing next time. You will be off the path and on enemy ground.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get side-tracked! Read My Instructions and keep your eyes on the path. No matter what others say or do, take the right way and follow your Commander, Jesus. The wrong way will only get you into trouble.</p>

<p class="signature">In all faithfulness,<br />Lord of the Kingdom</p>

<h1>A Good Game</h1>

<p>Have you ever played &#8220;What Time is it, Mr. Clock?&#8221; Here is an outdoor game that works the same way.</p>

<p>One person will be the &#8220;Bible&#8221; and stand facing away from the rest. The rest should stand in a row on the other side of the yard, taking steps toward the &#8220;Bible&#8221; during the game.</p>

<p>To start, players call out &#8220;What book is in the Bible?&#8221; The &#8220;Bible&#8221; should name a book, like &#8220;First Peter!&#8221; If the book is in the Old Testament, everyone takes 1 step. If it is in the New Testament, they take 2 steps.</p>

<p>The game continues until the &#8220;Bible&#8221; calls out &#8220;Revelation!&#8221; and turns around to try to tag someone. Everyone must run back to the starting line or get caught!</p>

<p>Do you obey exactly what Daddy or Mommy ask you to do? Jesus was faithful to please His Father in everything He did.</p>

<p>Are you careful to do your best when you work? Jesus didn&#8217;t shirk His work, but was faithful to the end. He gave His life for us!</p>

<p>Do you show love by serving others, even if it is hard? Jesus is faithful to us, in good times and bad times. He is always there to help us and lead us in the right way.</p>

<p>Will you follow Him?</p>

<h1>Billy and the Bones</h1>

<p>&#8220;My, what big, big things!&#8221; Billy said. He was very excited. Uncle Robert had come to visit, and he had brought Billy a picture book of dinosaurs. The pictures of dinosaurs showed huge animals with big necks that were eating something from the tops of trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do they live?&#8221; Billy asked. He looked at Uncle Robert.</p>

<p>Uncle Robert looked kind of funny. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;they are all dead now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did they die?&#8221; Billy asked.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_23/bones_book.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Uncle Robert said, &#8220;we are not sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When did they live?&#8221; Billy asked. He had been studying things that happened way back before he was born, even before his mother and daddy were born; and he could understand better when he knew the year that they happened.</p>

<p>Uncle Robert frowned. &#8220;It was before there were any people,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow!&#8221; Billy said, jumping to his feet and getting his Bible from the shelf. &#8220;People were created on the sixth day.&#8221; He opened to
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+1%3A20-31">Genesis 1:20-31</a>.
&#8220;Water animals and birds were created on the fifth day. So these dinosaurs must have been made on the sixth day because they live on the land.&#8221; Billy thought hard. &#8220;That would mean that they must have died in a very short time,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;because Adam and Eve were created on the sixth day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That book doesn&#8217;t say anything about these animals,&#8221; Uncle Robert said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then how do you know?&#8221; Billy asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;People have dug up their bones in the ground,&#8221; Uncle Robert replied. He turned to a page in the picture book and showed a photograph of people digging in a hole in the ground. Lying on the ground was a big bone. It was longer than Billy.</p>

<p>Billy was surprised. &#8220;How can you tell from old bones in the ground what they were like and when they lived?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Daddy came into the room in time to hear this last question. &#8220;You can&#8217;t,&#8221; he said. &#8220;People just want to believe that they can. That is their religion.&#8221; He looked at Uncle Robert. &#8220;The religion of old bones,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;It takes more faith to believe in that than to believe the Bible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle Robert soon left, and Billy asked Daddy why he believed in old bones rather than the Bible. Daddy looked sad. &#8220;He just wants to believe that,&#8221; Daddy said. &#8220;He thinks that everything that is alive came from little teeny, tiny animals that we call bacteria.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even us?&#8221; Billy said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Billy! Even us, ridiculous as it sounds. He does not like to think about God or to be thankful to God. He would rather believe in this strange idea. There are a lot of people like him. They work very hard and spend their lives trying to prove that man is just an animal so that they can live just as they please.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Princess,</p>

<p>In the last issue you heard about Sarah and her special donkey colt. Amanda Erickson (age 9) finished the story for us:</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Oh, no! Someone was leading Starlight out of the barn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father, someone is taking Starlight away!&#8221; said Sarah. Sarah flew out the door and toward the men. Father was close behind her. Just as she neared the strangers, a thought occurred to her. &#8220;If God wants me to have my colt, He will not have the strangers take it away,&#8221; she thought, so she slowed down to a walk. Father caught up with her and began to talk with the strangers.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing with my daughter&#8217;s colt?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The stranger in a red coat spoke, &#8220;The Master, Jesus, wants him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jesus? She had heard that name before. It was the name of the great healing prophet! He had healed deaf and dumb Jessica who lived farther down her street. Suddenly she wanted to give her little colt to Jesus. 	</p>

<p>Sarah whispered in her father&#8217;s ear, &#8220;Before I said that nobody could have it, but I think Jesus can have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess my daughter has changed her mind. You may have the colt,&#8221; he said to the strangers.</p>

<p>Later that morning Sarah and her brother Joel heard the sound of singing when they were playing outside. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go see what it is all about,&#8221; Sarah suggested. As they came to the street they saw rows and rows of people lined up. They were waving branches.</p>

<p>Joel ran to a nearby tree and got some branches. He handed two to Sarah. &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Farther down the road a man dressed in a white robe was coming up the dirt path. He was Jesus, and what was he riding on? It looked like Starlight! It was Starlight.</p>

<p>After Jesus was out of sight down the road, she and Joel ran back to their house and told Father and Mother. That night Sarah was lonely for Starlight, but she knew in her heart that she had made the right choice.</p>

<p>In the morning she woke up. It was late but she had to do her job to take care of the chickens. When she came past Starlight&#8217;s pen, there he was sitting as calmly as ever! Sarah was so glad she had given up her colt.</p>

<p>When she came in the house again, Father&#8217;s eyes were twinkling. &#8220;They brought him back this morning,&#8221; he said.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>So you see, dear princesses, it always pays to be unselfish and let Jesus have His way in everything. Sarah gave up Starlight, but Jesus gave him back!</p>

<p>What do you think would have happened if Sarah had said, &#8220;No!&#8221; when the disciples came for the colt? I&#8217;m sure they would not have taken Starlight if Sarah had not been willing. Maybe they would have gone to another little girl&#8217;s house and selfish Sarah would have kept Starlight. She would have missed a blessing, though.</p>

<p>Be like Sarah and always say &#8220;Yes&#8221; to Jesus when He asks something of you. Remember that you will always miss a blessing whenever you do not give up your way.</p>

<p class="signature">Lots of love,<br />Aunt Grace</p>
