<h1>Chapter 28</h1>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first"><span class="scripture">&#8220;For thou shalt find it after many days.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ecclesiastes+11%3A1" title="Ecclesiastes 11:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ecclesiastes 11:1)</span></a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Come in&#8221;; and the Reverend Edward Lewis laid down his book, pushed back his study chair, and was ready to receive whoever was knocking at his study door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Lewis,&#8221; said the little girl who came in in answer to his invitation, &#8220;Father has just come from the post office, and he brought you some letters, and here they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Lewis thanked his little next-door neighbor, took his letters, and, when the room was quiet again, settled back in his chair to enjoy them.</p>

<p>The first one was from a brother minister, begging an exchange. The next brought a look of surprise and delight to his face, for he recognised Ellis Holbrook&#8217;s handwriting. And the delight spread and deepened as he read; especially when he came to one sentence: &#8220;I asked Father what message he had for you, and he replied, Send him this verse, and tell him that again it is peculiarly his, <span class="scripture">&#8216;I love the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+116%3A1" title="Psalm 116:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 116:1)</span></a></span>&nbsp;&#8221; That, you see, would have told me the whole story, without this long letter. &#8220;I thank God that He put it into your heart to pray for me, as also that He has heard your prayers. God bless you. By the way, Father wants you to assist him on the first Sunday in July. I earnestly hope you can do so; he thinks you will be coming east about that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Was there ever a more thankful heart than was that minister&#8217;s as he laid down his old schoolfellow&#8217;s letter? How constantly, how sometimes almost hopelessly, had he prayed for Ellis Holbrook! How many times had he been obliged to reassure himself with the promise, <span class="scripture">&#8220;In due season we shall reap, if we faint not.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+6%3A9" title="Galatians 6:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 6:9)</span></a></span> And now again had God&#8217;s word been verified to him. He took the letter up once more, to look lovingly at that closing, never before written by Ellis&#8212;&#8220;Your brother in Christ.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was still another letter to read. That writing, too, was familiar; he had received many reminders of it during the past years. He laughed as he read, it sounded so like the writer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noindent first">ALBANY, <i>June</i>&#8212;, 18&#8212;.</p>

<p class="noindent">DEAR TIP&#8212;</p>

<p>Do you have Fourth of July out your way this year? We do here in Albany; rather, I&#8217;m going to have one in my yard. Perhaps you remember a Fourth of July which you took me to once, when we were ragged little wretches at home? I do, anyhow, and this is to be twin-brother to that time. All the ugly, dingy little urchins that I know have been invited. We&#8217;re to have fine fireworks and fine singing and fine <i>eating</i>. My wife added that last item&#8212;thought it a great improvement. I&#8217;m not sure but it is; most things are that she has a hand in.</p>

<p>Now, to come to the point of this letter&#8212;you&#8217;re to make the speech on that occasion. No getting out of it now! I planned this thing one day in the old schoolhouse. Oh, did you know Mr. Burrows had given up teaching? Grown too old. Queer, isn&#8217;t it? Don&#8217;t seem as if anybody was growing old except me. At first I wasn&#8217;t going to have my feast on the Fourth, because, you remember, it was on <i>that</i> day that our blessed Ray left us; but, talking with Mr. Minturn about it, he said Ray would have been delighted with it all&#8212;and so he would, you know. Don&#8217;t think we are going to gather in all Albany; it&#8217;s only the younger scholars of the mission school, in which my wife and I are interested.</p>

<p>Tell Howard and Kitty to be sure and come; they can put their visit a few weeks earlier as well as not.</p>

<p>Oh, by the way, if you have heard from Ellis Holbrook lately, you are singing &#8216;Glory, hallelujah&#8217; by this time!</p>

<p>&#8220;I am writing this in the counting-room, and am in a great hurry, though you wouldn&#8217;t think it. Shall expect you by the third, <i>certainly</i>.</p>

<p class="signature">Yours, etc.,<br />BOB TURNER.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>These letters came on Saturday evening. The next morning, in Sunday school, when the superintendent&#8217;s bell rang, the minister left his class of mission scholars, and went up the aisle towards the altar, pausing first to speak with a bright-eyed little lady, who sat before her class of bright-eyed little girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kitty, where is Howard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At home, coaxing a fit of sick headache.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here are letters that will interest you both&#8212;came last evening; one contains an invitation. Tell Howard I think we must try to go. Mother bade me tell you she wanted to see you at the parsonage in the morning; she is not out today.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he went on. The scholars began to sit up straight, and fold their arms; they knew they must listen if they wanted Mr. Lewis to talk to them. When every eye was fixed on him, he began:</p>

<p>&#8220;Children, I have a very short story to tell you today about myself. Years ago, when I was a little boy, my Sunday school teacher told us a story, one morning, which was the means of bringing me to Jesus. I have to thank that lady, next to God, that I am standing here today a minister of Christ. She was not our regular teacher, but was a stranger; I never saw her after that Sunday. Perhaps you can imagine how I have longed, since I became a man and a minister, to find that lady, and tell her what one hour of faithful teaching did for me. I thought it would help her, encourage her. I thought she would be likely to tell it to other teachers, and it would help them. But though I had it always in mind, and made very earnest efforts to find her, I never succeeded until last week. You know, children, it is ten years since I came here to be your pastor, and last week I learned that during all this time I have been living within twenty miles of the lady whom I have so long been seeking. And what else do you think I heard of her? Why, that two weeks ago she died. Scholars, my first thought was a sad one, that I never could thank her now. But you know I can; I expect to one of these days. Why, when I get to heaven, one of the first things I shall do will be to seek her out and tell her about it. So, you see, she will know it, even if some of the watching angels up there have not told her already.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just here, I want to say one word to the teachers. This incident should come with wonderful encouragement to your hearts, reminding you that you may often speak words which spring up and bear fruit that reaches up to God, though you do not know it, and <i>will</i> not, until in heaven you take your crowns, and question why there are so many stars.</p>

<p>&#8220;Children, next Sunday I will tell you the story which led me to Christ; and all this week I am going to pray that it may have the same effect on some of my scholars.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is time now for your verse. If any of you can find out why what I have been telling you today made me think of this verse, you may tell me next Sunday. Now repeat&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8216;Cast thy bread upon the waters, for thou shalt find it after many days.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ecclesiastes+11%3A1" title="Ecclesiastes 11:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ecclesiastes 11:1)</span></a></span>&nbsp;&#8221;</p>
