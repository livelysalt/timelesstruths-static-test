<h1>The Blessedness of Prayer</h1>

<p>Why are there so few who are often and long in secret prayer? It seems there can be but one answer. It Is because so few have a relish for such prayer and find enjoyment in it. Men usually engage in that which they enjoy. When Christians get into the secrets of private prayer, they find in it the highest joy of which the human soul is capable. Then no other place is so dear to them as their place of retirement, and no other comfort is so sweet as that which they there receive. Alas! secret prayer is a dull irksome duty to more than a few. It need not be so. Out of the fullness of our heart we can sing that old familiar hymn:</p>

<p class="verse">Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer,<br />That calls me from a world of care<br />And bids me at my Father&#8217;s throne<br />Make all my wants and wishes known.<br />In seasons of distress and grief<br />My soul has often found relief<br />And oft escaped the tempter&#8217;s snare<br />By thy return, sweet hour of prayer.</p>

<p>God designed the place of secret communion with Him to be the nearest approach that a mortal could make to heaven. It is the place where souls take on the image of God; the place where the smile of the Lord leaves its imprint on the heart. It is the place where shadows pass away and beams of light from the glory-world peacefully steal over the soul. A few moments spent in prayer makes us more like God. The peace, the bliss, that fill the whole expanse of heaven is borne down to our souls by the angels as we are bowed in prayer, and on their return they convey the fragrance of praise from our hearts to the land beyond the sky. The angels that Jacob saw going up and down from earth to heaven on a great stairway were doubtless busily engaged in carrying blessings down to man and carrying praise and thanksgiving back to God.</p>

<p>Is it not true that too few of God&#8217;s children find sensible enjoyment in the hour of prayer? The world can sit for hours and tell of their pleasures and enjoyments, but how much have Christians to tell of the pleasures they find in a life of prayer? They can say that they find happiness in God, but can they tell the time when and the place where they found such blessedness in prayer? Can they talk of it, relating incident after incident of pleasurable communion with the Lord? Alas! too few can talk about the joy they find in their private devotions. They have but little to tell of their friendship with Jesus and very little in their life to indicate that they find delights in companionship with God. Many hearts find more struggle, more dullness, more weariness, more difficulties, and less enjoyment in secret prayer than in all their religious life beside. It should be the place of freedom, of rest, of repose, of joy.</p>

<p>That disciple who leaned on Jesus&#8217; breast says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. And these things write we unto you, that your joy might be full.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1%3A3-4" title="I&nbsp;John 1:3-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 1:3-4)</span></a></span>ome future time. At the time of his struggle he did not desire it and did not know that he ever would, but he shrank from yielding all into the Lord&#8217;s hands for fear that he might some time desire it, and it be denied him. We need to become reckless, so to speak, and cast ourselves adrift on the will of God. not fear; do not shrink; his way is best. But the will may sometimes seem very weak. One brother fought a prolonged battle before he gained the victory. There was something that he thought he might desire at some future time. At the time of his struggle he did not desire it and did not know that he ever would, but he shrank from yielding all into the Lord&#8217;s hands for fear that he might some time desire it, and it be denied him. We need to become reckless, so to speak, and cast ourselves adrift on the will of God.</p>

<p>In speaking of those who had joined themselves to the Lord to serve Him and love His name, the prophet says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Even them will I [the Lord] bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+56%3A7" title="Isaiah 56:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 56:7)</span></a></span>
It is one thing to talk about the blessedness of prayer, but quite another to experience that blessedness. With too many secret prayer is a dull irksome duty. Such persons find it difficult to engage the heart in fervent, earnest communion with God. Doubtless seasons of dullness come to all; but these seasons should not, and need not, be of long continuance. There should often be seasons of refreshing from the presence of the Lord. Keep all the tithes in, and God will open the windows and pour the blessings down. Keep your will in harmony with the divine will, walk with God in all His ways, and you will receive copious refreshing showers&#8212;showers that will make your heart like a watered garden.</p>

<p>of indifference over you; he will call your attention to the many duties of life; and tell you that amid these duties you have no time for prayer; he will make it appear most reasonable and make you feel that way; he will present subjects of thought, very pleasant subjects, and so innocent, so attractive, so fascinating. It is very hard to dismiss them, but very agreeable to entertain them. You find, however, that they savor a little of the flesh, of the world, and wean the affections from God.</p>

<p>To overcome this obstacle, faith in God is needed. This is the victory that overcometh the world, and also the devil, even our faith. A bold, undaunted and yet childlike faith in God will bring a hope to the soul, and that hope will give to the duty of prayer a vital principle that will make it a power and a joy.</p>

<p>What is to be gained by prayer?
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Ask, and ye shall receive.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+16%3A24" title="John 16:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 16:24)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+11%3A24" title="Mark 11:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 11:24)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+6%3A12" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 6:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 6:12)</span></a></span>
We can have all we need through prayer. We can have eternal life. We can have heaven. Since so much can be gained by prayer, surely if we have faith, prayer will be an important factor in life and will be a joy. A man who has his heart set upon gaining a home for himself and family will toil and endure hardships and difficulties, and do so hopefully and joyfully. His desire for the object to be gained and his love for his family make a duty a privilege. Likewise our hope of gaining heaven and the love we have for Jesus will surely give joy to the duty of prayer.</p>

<p>Prayer becomes an instinct of the soul at conversion; but as we grow in spiritual knowledge, we may in a measure lose that instinct (the more intelligent creatures are, the less instinct they have) and come to regard prayer as a duty&#8212;such an important one, however, that it becomes a business full of activity, power, and enjoyment. Have faith in God when you pray. Make Him real to you. Know when you kneel to pray that your feeble voice is going to be heard in heaven, and is going to have power with God and bring you that for which you ask. Two weeks ago a brother prayed for a certain need to be supplied. This very day a letter from over the sea brought him an answer. Faith will make prayer hopeful and joyful. As we bow upon our knees and by faith see God in His great love and care for us and readiness to hear our supplication, the affections of our heart are aroused, causing us to love Him with an intensity that makes the hour of communion with Him sacred and delightful.</p>

<p class="verse">My God, is any hour so sweet,<br />From blush of morn to evening star,<br />As that which calls me to thy feet&#8212;<br />The hour of prayer?</p>

<p class="verse">Blest is the tranquil hour of morn<br />And blest that hour of solemn eve<br />When on the wings of prayer upborne,<br />The world I leave.</p>

<p class="verse">Then is my strength, by Thee renewed,<br />Buoyancy to my hopes is given;<br />Then dost Thou cheer my solitude<br />With light from heaven.</p>

<p class="verse">No words can tell what sweet relief<br />There for my every want I find,<br />What strength for warfare, balm for grief,<br />What peace of mind.</p>

<p class="verse">Hushed is each doubt, gone every fear;<br />My spirit seems in heaven to stay.<br />It is the hour when every tear<br />Is wiped away.</p>

<p class="verse">Lord, till I reach that blissful shore,<br />No privilege so dear shall be<br />As thus my inmost soul to pour<br />In prayer to Thee.</p>
