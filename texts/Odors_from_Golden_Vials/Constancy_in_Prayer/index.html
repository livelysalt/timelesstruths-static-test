<h1>Constancy in Prayer</h1>

<p>Constancy in prayer implies a fixed principle of prayer in the life, an habitually devout spirit. It does not mean paroxysms of prayer, or prayer at stated times, but it means to
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Pray without ceasing.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+5%3A17" title="I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:17)</span></a></span>
There is a difference between constancy and fervency. By fervency we mean that earnest taking hold upon God for any specific object; by constancy we mean that habitual prayerful frame of spirit. Devoted men have said that &#8220;prayer is the breath of the soul.&#8221; Then let the soul never cease its breathing. Those who live in an atmosphere of prayer will love the place of secret prayer and the hour of public prayer. They will be glad when it comes time to go up to the house of prayer. To them it is a dear and sacred place. And oh, how they love the hour of private communion with God! He is the fairest and dearest of ten thousand to their souls. There is no companionship like His. No voice is so musical as His, no voice so tender and sweet.</p>

<p>Again we hear that excuse, &#8220;I have no time to pray.&#8221; You had as well say you do not love prayer. Somehow we will take time to do that which we love to do. Those who love the amusements of the world take time for them. You do not know how much you are saying when you say you have no time for prayer. No time to do that which we have such a relish for and find such enjoyment in! David said,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+42%3A1" title="Psalm 42:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 42:1)</span></a></span>
There should be a constant reaching forth of the soul after God. Life should be one long, undivided prayer. There has been much comment on the apostle&#8217;s words,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Pray without ceasing.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+5%3A17" title="I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:17)</span></a></span>
I believe them to mean that we should live in the spirit or temper of reverence and devoutness. We should have a continual spirit of prayer in our souls. This gives power to the life.</p>

<p>One who lives in a spirit of prayer is always ready to pray. I do not mean that he will always feel like praying, so far as emotions are concerned; but he feels like it, so far as a sense of duty and his will are concerned. One who lives a life of prayer is one who has stated times for prayer and observes them as strictly as propriety will admit. Besides this, he is often lifting his heart to God in petition or praise. When he sees a man doing evil, his first thought is to pray the Lord to have mercy upon him. When he sees a man prosper, he thanks God for His goodness to that person. He prays for those who despitefully use him. He gives thanks in everything: and as the giving of thanks is praying. He who lives a life of thanksgiving lives a life of prayer.</p>

<p>We are to rejoice in the Lord always. A spirit of rejoicing in God is a spirit of prayer. A life of worry, anxiety, and care is not a life of believing prayer. God would have His children to be ever free and happy, and to be so they must live in intimate communion with Him.</p>

<p class="verse">Dear restless heart, be still! Don&#8217;t fret and worry so.<br />God hath a thousand ways His love and help to show.<br />Just trust and trust and trust until His will you know.</p>

<p class="verse">Dear restless heart, be still; for peace is God&#8217;s own smile.<br />His love can ever wrong and sorrow reconcile;<br />Just love and love and love, and wait a while.</p>

<p class="verse">Dear restless heart, be brave; don&#8217;t moan and sorrow so.<br />He hath a meaning kind in chilly winds that blow;<br />Just hope and hope and hope until you braver grow.</p>

<p class="verse">Dear restless heart, repose upon His heart an hour.<br />His heart is strength and life, His heart is bloom and flower;<br />Just rest and rest and rest within His tender power.</p>

<p class="verse">Dear restless heart, be still; don&#8217;t toil and hurry so.<br />God is the silent One, forever calm and slow;<br />Just wait and wait and wait, and work with Him below.</p>

<p class="verse">Dear restless heart, be still; don&#8217;t struggle to be free.<br />God&#8217;s life is in your life; to Him you may now flee;<br />Just pray and pray and pray till you have faith to see.</p>
