<h1>Mental Prayer</h1>

<p class="author">Mrs. Florence Roberts</p>

<p>When our thoughts, as well as our words and deeds, continuously incline toward our heavenly Father and His Son, our blessed Redeemer, we shall comprehend as never before the interpretation of Paul&#8217;s counseling us to
<span class="scripture">&#8220;pray without ceasing.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+5%3A17" title="I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:17)</span></a></span>
Perhaps many of God&#8217;s children conceive the idea that we can pray only when on our knees. Were that the case, the heavenly Father would, I fear, receive very little of our time and attention. It is blessed to kneel often and pray audibly, but often this is not practicable.</p>

<p>Shortly after my conversion, more than fifteen years ago, when I began to delight in God&#8217;s Word, the Holy Spirit deeply impressed me with the advice found in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+6%3A6-8">Matthew 6:6-8</a>.
I began to inquire as to the meaning of the &#8220;prayer-closet.&#8221; At first I supposed this scripture to have only a literal meaning&#8212;to retire to a room set apart for this one purpose and to lock one&#8217;s self in. This was seldom convenient for me. Whilst I was yearning for a private place for this purpose, the blessed Lord illuminated my mind by definitely revealing this: &#8220;The closet means the innermost recesses of the soul. Even when thou art in a crowded assembly, thou mayest enjoy secret communion with me.&#8221;
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And it shall come to pass, that before [you] call, I will answer, and while [you] are yet speaking, I will hear.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+65%3A24" title="Isaiah 65:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 65:24)</span></a></span>
Blessed assurance! Blessed knowledge to the child of God that is surrounded in his home by mockers of prayer! We can be constantly in the spirit of prayer, holding, unknown to others, silent converse with the King of kings. Ofttimes, the most effective prayers we can offer are the silent prayers known to none but the heavenly Father.</p>

<p>Time and again have I personally realized this.
Our Father, who seeth in secret, has rewarded and will reward openly (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+6%3A6">Matthew 6:6</a>).</p>

<p>Dear reader, I beseech you in the name of Jesus to constantly hold mental conversation with God, the Giver of all good. He is very liberal, never giving with stinted hand. He yearns to bestow upon His waiting child His very best. Carelessness in prayer grieves Him. Alas! that guilt lies at the door of many. They request favor from God, but almost as soon as they cease praying, they forget what they asked for; therefore they are greatly surprised if God answers.</p>

<p>Our heavenly Father knows and He cares. He yearns for us to be deeply, intensely, in earnest concerning our souls&#8217; desires.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;God is a spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+4%3A24" title="John 4:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 4:24)</span></a></span>
Nothing less will satisfy Him; nothing less will bring answers to our prayers. Reader, do you love Him? Do you really, truly love Him? If so, there is nothing that you will not do in order that you may have His perpetual smile upon your soul. As the bride centers her thoughts on her adored husband, so will your spiritual mind be focalized upon this wonderful Bridegroom of your soul, who delights in anticipating your requirements and, not alone in granting your heart&#8217;s desires, but in lavishing upon you abundantly more than you could even ask or think. Have you observed how much the thoughts are prone to wander while you are engaged in prayer? Of course you have, and so have I. We must watch and bring in our wandering thoughts and center our mind on God. This will require mental effort. Unless we use our willpower in the control of our thoughts, we shall drift on the dangerous shoals of vagrancy, coldness, and carelessness. It will then become most difficult to centralize our mind on God.</p>

<p>How blessed that we have a Father who never tires of our appealing to Him! How very precious to know that He knows our yearnings, our desires, whether uttered or unuttered!
<span class="scripture">&#8220;No good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+84%3A11" title="Psalm 84:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 84:11)</span></a></span>
God knows your thoughts and hears your prayers. Keep your thoughts on God. The Psalmist prayed,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+19%3A14" title="Psalm 19:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 19:14)</span></a></span>
We pray with the heart and with the understanding also (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+14%3A15">I&nbsp;Corinthians 14:15</a>).
Such prayers are answered.</p>

<p>On one occasion, when testimony to answered prayer was being given, a brother related that once when he needed a pair of shoes, he made his need known to God. He said, &#8220;The Lord gave me the shoes the moment I asked Him, although I did not get them in possession for more than two weeks. They were mine from the moment I prayed, though they were on the shoemaker&#8217;s last or the merchant&#8217;s counter.&#8221;
<span class="scripture">&#8220;What things soever ye desire, when you pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+11%3A24" title="Mark 11:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 11:24)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Lord, Increase our faith.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+17%3A5" title="Luke 17:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 17:5)</span></a></span>
Amen.</p>

<p class="verse">When thou dost talk with God&#8212;by prayer I mean&#8212;<br />Lift up pure hands, lay down all lust&#8217;s desires,<br />Fix thoughts on heaven, present a conscience clean,<br />Since holy flame to mercy&#8217;s throne aspires.</p>
