<h1>Praying In Jesus&#8217; Name</h1>

<p class="verse">Sing, oh, sing the name of Jesus<br />All along the way of life.</p>

<p>There is but one name in which we can come to God. That name is Jesus. If we come and knock in our name, the door will not be opened unto us; but if we knock in Jesus&#8217; name, it will be opened. At the name of Jesus the angels bow.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+16%3A23" title="John 16:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 16:23)</span></a></span>
The Father has promised to give us all things with Jesus. Thus in Christ we have every temporal and spiritual need supplied. The Father was well pleased with the Son and heard Him in all things. It is only in Him that God is well pleased with us and will hear us. Jesus offered himself to God as a sacrifice for us. This sacrifice is a sweet-smelling savor unto God. Only when we come to God in the name of Jesus and in acknowledgment of the sacrifice He made for us will our prayers be fragrant. There is no fragrance in man. What is meant by praying in Jesus&#8217; name we can understand by one text of scripture:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+4%3A1" title="Philippians 4:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 4:1)</span></a></span>
God never gives anything to man except through Christ. It is Jesus that holds the bank account. He has deposited riches of every kind with the Father. He has placed in the bank of heaven a generous deposit of grace, which contains all the needs of every creature. In that grace there is remission of sins, sanctifying power, healing virtue; there is our daily bread, raiment, and every temporal need; there is comfort and consolation, joy and peace, love, meekness, and wisdom. Take a look at that store of grace, or call it the bank of heaven if you choose. Everything that man has need of for soul or body, for time or eternity, is deposited in that bank.</p>

<p>It was Jesus who made the deposit, and it is He who holds the account. Man has never placed one single thing there to his credit. In fact, there was a great debt there against him; but Jesus has paid that and has placed there a great storehouse of riches. But it is all in His name. Now if I should give you a check on a bank in which I have made no deposit, would you get any money when you presented the check? Certainly not, because I should have nothing there to my credit. But if a man that has placed money in the bank should give you a check, the cashier, on seeing the signature, would pay you what the check calls for. So if you go to the bank of heaven in Jesus&#8217; name, you will certainly get what you ask for. But be sure you get the name of Jesus on your check. If you need food or clothing or healing for your body, or wisdom and grace to help you bear your trial, or comfort to soothe the pain of sorrow, He will certainly give you a check, because He has promised to do so. When you get His name on the check, then go to God and present it. He will look at it and, seeing the name of Jesus, will be pleased. But God must also know the petitioner. Faith is the act by which God recognizes the one presenting the check. So when you desire anything from God, get the signature of Jesus, exercise faith, and you will certainly receive all for which the check calls.</p>

<p class="verse">Be not faithless, but believing,<br />Though the shadows deepen fast.<br />&#8217;Tis the darkest ere the dawning;<br />Morning light will break at last.</p>

<p class="verse">Be not faithless, but believing;<br />Oh! &#8217;tis Jesus breathes the word.<br />Yes, He hears thy heart&#8217;s quick beating,<br />And will help and strength afford.</p>

<p class="verse">Fear not though He seem to tarry;<br />Calmly on His promise wait.<br />Jesus knows the fitting moment,<br />And He never comes too late.</p>

<p class="verse">Every grain of faith, to Jesus<br />Is more precious far than gold.<br />&#8217;Tis to test thy faith&#8217;s true metal<br />That He doth the gift withhold.</p>

<p class="verse">Blest are they who wait for Jesus;<br />&#8217;Tis more precious far than gold.<br />&#8217;Tis to test thy faith&#8217;s true metal<br />That He doth the gift withhold.</p>

<p class="verse">Blest are they who wait for Jesus;<br />They shall never wait in vain.<br />Hope may lie awhile in grave-clothes;<br />Faith shall bid her rise again.</p>

<p class="verse">Be not faithless, but believing,<br />Though the shadows deepen fast.<br />&#8217;Tis the darkest ere the dawning;<br />Morning light will break at last.</p>
