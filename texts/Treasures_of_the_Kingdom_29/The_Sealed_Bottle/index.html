<h1>The Sealed Bottle</h1>

<p>Ted snuggled closer to his mother. She laid the Bible storybook away and kissed her son on the top of his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I love you. When I grow up, I want to marry you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am already married,&#8221; Mother smiled. &#8220;I am married to Daddy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Ted. He knew that Mother and Daddy were married, but he had forgotten.</p>

<p>&#8220;But who will I marry?&#8221; said Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Lord will provide you with someone to marry,&#8221; Mother said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know her,&#8221; Mother said, &#8220;but right now, she is a little girl who is growing up just like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ted twisted around and looked his mother in the face. &#8220;Where does she live?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Mother said, &#8220;but we could pray for her.&#8221; Ted and his Mother got on their knees by his bed. Ted prayed first. He asked God to help him to live for Him. &#8220;Please help&#8230;&#8203;this special girl&#8230;&#8203;&#8221; he prayed. &#8220;Help her to love You and do what is right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Mother prayed. Ted could hear tears in her voice as she asked God to bless Ted and his future companion. Ted knew what a companion was. Mother and Daddy were companions. They did everything together. They helped each other, and it was very special. Mother said that she and Daddy were one, even though they were two.</p>

<p>The next morning, Daddy helped Ted to write a letter. Ted had to copy the letter over seven times before everything was right! It was a lot of hard work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noindent first">Dear future wife,</p>

<p>I am eight years old. I love Jesus with all my heart. This letter is for my wife that Jesus has for me. If you are that girl, then this letter is for you.</p>

<p>I cannot marry my Mother because she is already married to my Daddy.</p>

<p>Do good things and let Jesus help you. When we grow up, Jesus will help us to find out where we live.</p>

<p class="signature">Love,<br />Ted</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Daddy helped Ted to put this letter in a bottle. It was a small bottle, and it was made of clear glass. You could see the letter inside. Then Daddy melted wax and sealed the top of the lid before he screwed down the top. Ted had seen Mother seal the tops of jelly jars with wax before.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_29/sealed_bottle.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="147" /></div>
<p>&#8220;This bottle is like you,&#8221; Daddy said. &#8220;You are sealing up your heart to be ready for the girl that Jesus has for you, so that nothing else can get into your heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the bottle was sealed, Ted and Daddy drove to the big bridge over the river. They got out of the car. Ted dropped the sealed letter into the big river below. Ted and Daddy watched as the bottle floated down the river until they could see it no more.</p>
