<h1>Indulgence in Forbidden Things</h1>

<p>Now, as he went onward in his journey, he came upon a beautiful little city, and upon inquiry found that there was in that place a company of faithful ones, who had a pastor by the name of Mr. Sincerity. So he went to them and said, &#8220;Have ye received this glorious Evening Light which is being preached in these last days?&#8221; to which they all declared that they had not so much as heard of such a thing, but refused to let him go until he had told them all about the beautiful doctrine, and the camp meeting from which he had just come. They were greatly delighted with his teachings, for he was intelligent as to doctrine, and had preached it perfectly. Besides this, he had only taken out his presents to look at a few times, so the Lord in longsuffering had not then left him, and he still had much of the same blessings as before. If he had then and there cast those abominations away, it would have been well for both himself and others. But he did not.</p>

<p>Now those faithful ones, to whom he brought the light, went about immediately to put away all worldliness, rejoicing that they had the privilege of doing so for Jesus&#8217; sake. Not only so, but being of very generous mind, they provided him with a home, the best of food, and many of the good things of life; therefore he began to feel quite settled and found time now and then to steal away and examine the forbidden gifts which he had received while among his friends.</p>

<p>First he would open the little vial, and being tempted by the sweet odor which it gave forth, he would take a few drops of the ointment. This would bring a spell over him, noticeable to others but not to himself. At another time he would bring out his coins and look upon them until they dazzled his eyes: and forgetting the power of God, by which all these things shall be added, he would crave only for more of these coins&#8212;for the work of God, so he thought. Then, when a test of affliction would come upon him or his, he would secretly look to doctor books, pills and powders, although in his preaching he had told the faithful ones to trust in God alone. This naturally brought a cloud over his spiritual vision, so that he could not easily get a message from God. Therefore, rather than go before his followers with no message at all, he had recourse to his philosophy and other forbidden books which he had quietly gathered and kept secretly in a dark corner of his study.</p>
