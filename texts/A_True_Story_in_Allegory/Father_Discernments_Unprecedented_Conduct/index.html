<h1>Father Discernment&#8217;s Unprecedented Conduct</h1>

<p>Now, old Father Discernment just then entered the meeting, and upon seeing Mr. Policy in the pulpit, he began to roar out like a lion: &#8220;Beware! beware! faithful ones, this is a compromise of the devil. Flee for your lives! Do not lend your ears to this poisonous talk.&#8221; At this he, with several other of the fathers, sprang from their seats and with a large company of faithful ones, withdrew to a place apart.</p>

<p>Now, Father Discernment was held in very high esteem, both by the fathers and by the faithful ones, and because of this they had presented to him a castle called &#8220;Influence&#8221; upon a very high hill called &#8220;Position.&#8221; In this hill was also a gold mine. Now as he had forgotten all this in his zeal and roaring out, suddenly a thought-arrow pierced his head. It was shot from the bow of Mr. Self-Interest, who was the son of Old Honorable and his wife whose parental name was Covetous. This arrow turned his head in the direction of his estate, and there to his great sorrow he saw a party from the camp going thither as if to capture it. Now, he had his choice either to do as Moses did (Hebrews 11:24-26), or like Lot&#8217;s wife, to look back. The temptation was too much for him, therefore he betook himself to the castle, and seizing one of the bows of Mrs. Apostasy&#8217;s make, he began to hurl the arrows thick and fast into the little company which he so lately had led out of danger. Now for a long time the faithful ones had formed the habit of leaning entirely upon the understanding of Father Discernment, as it was much easier to inquire of him concerning a matter, than to seek an interview directly with the King; and because of this they had given him the castle and somewhat undue prominence. Therefore when they saw his unprecedented conduct they were thrown into utter confusion. Some took it for granted that he had suddenly seen his mistake in leaving the camp and in making such an uproar, so they, without asking any questions, returned to the camp and apologized for their strange conduct, though they knew not exactly why they did so. Others scattered hither and thither as the missiles from the castle fell thick and fast among them.</p>
