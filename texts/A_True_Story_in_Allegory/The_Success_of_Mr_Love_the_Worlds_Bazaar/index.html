<h1>The Success of Mr. Love-the-World&#8217;s Bazaar</h1>

<p>Next morning, the faithful ones who had received Mr. Hypocrisy&#8217;s dope the evening before, awoke feeling rather top-heavy, and instead of attending to their usual interview with the King, they decided to lay aside restraint for the day and resort to some place of pleasure. Mr. Love-the-World, foreseeing what would happen, had built his booths just at the edge of an innocent-looking picnic ground. There was one called sociability booth. In this place was to be had, free of charge, all manner of gossip and evil speaking, jokes and plays, in fact, about anything on the social line except hymns, spiritual songs, holy conversation, and godliness. Then came the booth for wearing apparel&#8212;fashions, freaks, and fancies&#8212;and some substitutes, such as those who did not want to bear the reproach of being very worldly could wear, and still not be reproached for being old-fashioned or peculiar. Then he had one booth for worldly honors. In it were all manner of certificates, medals, and medallions for those who would lay aside their narrow-mindedness, so that they might with their whole heart seek for his honors. Then he had a booth for the exhibition of all manner of religions for those who were not inclined to buy his other wares. So in all, his display was quite enticing to a company of heavy-headed, dim-eyed saints, and they forthwith set in to buy his goods, some at one booth and some at the other, according to their several inclinations. Of course, this was with the understanding that they should still be acknowledged by their pastor, Mr. Hypocrisy, who by this time was anxious for his flock to give attention to such things so that his own reproach might be removed. Also while they were thus engaged he had caught his adversary Mr. Sincerity, and, after binding him in chains, had sent him to an unknown destination.</p>

<p>Now, there were three of the faithful ones who had not accepted Mr. Hypocrisy&#8217;s dope, though they had refused it so quietly that no one had noticed the fact for the time being. They were Miss Perception, Old Mr. Steadfast, and his wife, Humility. So to the consternation of all, who should be seen coming toward the bazaar next morning but these three. Then did the faithful ones begin to feel somewhat uncomfortable, for they could see by the expression of their friends that they did not approve of the show. However, Mr. Love-the-World put on a bold face and asked them to buy his wares. At which Miss Perception answered, &#8220;No, thank you; for I perceive that your goods are of a very shoddy character and do not have the King&#8217;s seal upon them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said Mr. Steadfast, &#8220;I am very busy this morning and have no time for your trifles&#8221;; and so answered his wife. And so they went about their business, as they had received a commission from the King to perform some important errands that day.</p>
