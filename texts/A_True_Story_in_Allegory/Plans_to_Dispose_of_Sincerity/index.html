<h1>Plans to Dispose of Sincerity</h1>

<p>Now their first step was to warn the great camp of the saints against him by letter in which they wrote: &#8220;It is with sad hearts that we are compelled to warn you that Mr. Sincerity is no longer worthy of your confidence, as he has manifested a very bad spirit of division; therefore receive none of his reports.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then did Mr. Love-the-World make a suggestion, saying, &#8220;Now as to the local congregation, since they love Mr. Sincerity so much, and have such confidence in him, we would only defeat our own plans to renounce him at present. Therefore I suggest that our beloved kinsman take the pulpit this evening, and administer some of the &#8220;great praise&#8221; ointment from his vial. This will cause them to forget the excitement of the day, and also the cause. Then tomorrow while they are still dazed I will hold a fair with some of my most innocent-looking wares on exhibition; and while I have their attention, then our kinsman can dispose of old Sincerity as he shall see fit, and they will perhaps never miss him, or perchance if they do, you can again bring out the club, as they will then be too much weakened to put up much of a fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what can I do?&#8221; said Mr. Lustful-Eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;The best thing you can do at present is to keep still and out of sight, for it is mostly because of you and your luggage that all this commotion has come about, and the necessity for all these plans. Why, even the world would abhor us if they knew that you were among us!&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon this Mr. Lustful-Eyes exclaimed in anger, &#8220;I am your brother and have a right to be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Policy soothingly replied, &#8220;Yes, brother, but you know we will have to use wisdom or else the faithful ones will all lose confidence in us and consequently we will come to poverty.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment, seeing the depths of iniquity to which his relatives were bringing him, Mr. Hypocrisy found himself, as it were, standing alone upon a pinnacle of decision, such as comes to one at very critical times during life and in a burst of disgust, he exclaimed, &#8220;I feel like clearing you all out, and calling in the faithful ones and Mr. Sincerity to help. You are bringing me to ruin.&#8221; Whereupon Miss Vanity began to weep and told him what a disgrace it would be for a brilliant young man like him to humble himself before those little nobodies. This rather cooled his indignation, then Mr. Policy said, &#8220;I see a very short and easy way through this difficulty, if you will only keep yourself in my hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; said Mr. Lying, &#8220;I have a beautiful cover made that will hide all our faults, even to Brother Lustful-Eyes.&#8221; And Mr. Love-the-World assured him that he was quite sure he could soon have those faithful ones all duped so that they would never again be so particular about those little things. So with all this assurance, Hypocrisy continued his course as before planned.</p>
