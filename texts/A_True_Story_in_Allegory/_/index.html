<h1>Hypocrisy&#8217;s Visit to the Great Camp</h1>

<p>Mr. Hypocrisy had once been a humble saint, one of those chosen ones upon whom God pours out special blessings and anointing. He had lived in an obscure place and was noted for his godly and simple life. He also had a great longing for his brethren in the Lord. Finally one day he said to his friends, &#8220;Let me go unto my brethren, that I may enjoy their fellowship and be refreshed by them.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he approached the camp of the saints, he heard the high praises of God, and some came running to meet him to give him loving welcome, and others even wept for very joy at seeing his face. With this inspiration, together with the fullness of the Spirit, the strings of his tongue were loosed and he became so eloquent in prophesying that all were made to marvel, and to glorify God in him. Had this been all, our subject might still be glorifying God in his ministry. But the sad part, which made him Mr. Hypocrisy, happened just as the meeting was over. Mrs. Simpleton came forward in her overmuch zeal and presented him with a bottle of &#8220;great praise&#8221; ointment. This, if taken moderately, will revive a drooping spirit under certain conditions; but if taken excessively it brings on blindness, a swelling of the head, and, consequently, a wandering of the feet into forbidden paths. Then came forth Mr. Bigheart and gave our friend a purse of gold coins. This was his first experience with gold, and it, like the ointment, if immoderately administered, creates an appetite for itself and leads into by-paths. Then, just outside the camp, came Mr. Worldly-Wise and presented him with a neat little gilt-edged booklet on philosophy, saying, &#8220;I have heard your eloquence, and knowing that you are a man of wisdom, I herewith beg of you that you accept this gift with which I am sure you will be charmed when once you have given it your attention. Besides it will greatly help you in your work among the better classes, as the gospel without some help does not always take.&#8221; So our friend pocketed the forbidden book and with the presents that he had received, started for his field of labor.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/A_True_Story_in_Allegory/Indulgence_in_Forbidden_Things/index.html">Indulgence in Forbidden Things</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Indulgence in Forbidden Things</h1>

<p>Now, as he went onward in his journey, he came upon a beautiful little city, and upon inquiry found that there was in that place a company of faithful ones, who had a pastor by the name of Mr. Sincerity. So he went to them and said, &#8220;Have ye received this glorious Evening Light which is being preached in these last days?&#8221; to which they all declared that they had not so much as heard of such a thing, but refused to let him go until he had told them all about the beautiful doctrine, and the camp meeting from which he had just come. They were greatly delighted with his teachings, for he was intelligent as to doctrine, and had preached it perfectly. Besides this, he had only taken out his presents to look at a few times, so the Lord in longsuffering had not then left him, and he still had much of the same blessings as before. If he had then and there cast those abominations away, it would have been well for both himself and others. But he did not.</p>

<p>Now those faithful ones, to whom he brought the light, went about immediately to put away all worldliness, rejoicing that they had the privilege of doing so for Jesus&#8217; sake. Not only so, but being of very generous mind, they provided him with a home, the best of food, and many of the good things of life; therefore he began to feel quite settled and found time now and then to steal away and examine the forbidden gifts which he had received while among his friends.</p>

<p>First he would open the little vial, and being tempted by the sweet odor which it gave forth, he would take a few drops of the ointment. This would bring a spell over him, noticeable to others but not to himself. At another time he would bring out his coins and look upon them until they dazzled his eyes: and forgetting the power of God, by which all these things shall be added, he would crave only for more of these coins&#8212;for the work of God, so he thought. Then, when a test of affliction would come upon him or his, he would secretly look to doctor books, pills and powders, although in his preaching he had told the faithful ones to trust in God alone. This naturally brought a cloud over his spiritual vision, so that he could not easily get a message from God. Therefore, rather than go before his followers with no message at all, he had recourse to his philosophy and other forbidden books which he had quietly gathered and kept secretly in a dark corner of his study.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/A_True_Story_in_Allegory/Friendship_with_the_World_Begins/index.html">Friendship with the World Begins</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Friendship with the World Begins</h1>

<p>Now as birds of a feather will flock together, or magnets will attract one another, Mr. Hypocrisy began to draw those of his true likeness to himself, notwithstanding his beautiful teachings and his high profession. First came Miss Vanity, who carried herself so proudly. With her he was simply charmed, and soon announced their engagement; and although the faithful ones had been told that they must lay aside all the pride and display of the world, yet he was now so captivated with his new lady, that he demanded the faithful ones to fellowship with her whether or no. This brought confusion and a rustling about, as when a vulture swoops down among a flock of doves. This roused Mr. Sincerity, who, because of a feeling of security, had been taking a rest. But upon asking what the trouble might be, he was assured by Mr. Hypocrisy that the faithful ones, for some unknown reason, had become unruly, and were causing dissention, but that he would soon bring them to order again with a club which he kept for that purpose. (This club was an instrument made to appear as the true sword, and had written on its handle the words, &#8220;Unity and submission&#8221;; but he did not show this false sword to Mr. Sincerity.) So the faithful ones were for a time frightened into a forced unity and fear of the sin of division; and in the meanwhile Mr. Hypocrisy and Miss Vanity were bringing their courtship to a successful consummation.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/A_True_Story_in_Allegory/Calling_a_Council/index.html">Calling a Council</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Calling a Council</h1>

<p>The lady&#8217;s sister, Mrs. Apostasy, wrote them happy congratulations, assuring them that she would be present at the wedding. A little later, some of Miss Vanity&#8217;s relatives arrived by the midnight train. Their names were Mr. Lying, Mr. Policy, Mr. Love-the-World, Mr. No-Conscience, and Mr. Lustful-Eyes. Mr. Hypocrisy felt a little ashamed of his new relatives, but as he had engaged to Miss Vanity, therefore he was bound to accept those of her family, and do the best he could to conceal their identity. Shortly after their arrival, Mr. Sincerity and the faithful ones received a rude awakening, by strange muttering voices and a horrible stench which almost overwhelmed them. This stench came from the detestable things brought in the baggage of some of these relatives. Upon their asking Mr. Hypocrisy as to the trouble, he, with a smile and look of astonishment, declared that all was well; and ordered them to be quiet and trouble him no more on this matter. This again brought a rustling about among the faithful ones, and this time Mr. Hypocrisy was quite puzzled as to what to do. &#8220;Because,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if we use the club, it will only stir up the more inquiry as to this thing which is hidden among us, and if not, then we will be under suspicion of having tried to deceive.</p>

<p>Whereupon he called his newly made friends in council as to what to do. Now as they were very proud of his position as a minister to the faithful, and had looked forward to the time when they should by him be introduced into the congregation, therefore they put their wits to work to consider what should be done. Mr. Policy was appointed chairman, and Mr. Lying, president of the meeting, they both being expert in such matters. That very hour Mr. Hypocrisy had sustained a very severe attack of heart trouble, not for concern of the faithful ones, but because of the fact that ever since he had become friendly with Miss Vanity he had been troubled with misgivings as to his prestige and his purse, until now he realized that unless something were done he should lose both. Then did Mr. Policy stand forth and begin to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brethren, this is a critical hour to which we have come, especially since Mr. Hypocrisy, our faithful kinsman, is about to be put to shame before those who hitherto have esteemed him very highly; and this we know that it is on our account that this humiliation is about to come upon him. Therefore anything that we can do to protect him from this awful shock, we feel duty bound to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said Mr. Lying, &#8220;I believe I can help if the particulars of the case can be presented to me so that I can make my coverings to fit.&#8221; Then Mr. Love-the-World and his brothers, Lustful-Eyes and No-Conscience, both agreed to do what they could.</p>

<p>Then did Mr. Hypocrisy recover himself enough to place the matter before them, saying, &#8220;Dear friends, I cannot express my sorrow that you should have received such a cool reception from my flock. It is quite out of place, but, as they are very profitable to me, I will have to ask you to bear with their narrow-mindedness for a time at least. Of course it is through my teaching that they received those notions in the first place. For when I first came back from the great camp of the saints, (who are also very profitable to me)&#8221;&#8212;upon which he presented the vial of ointment, the purse of gold, and the book on philosophy, which he had received from them&#8212;&#8220;I was also very zealous for those peculiar ideas about faith, zeal, loving not the world, hating uncleanness, and all that; and I preached that sort of doctrine to them. So now I have it to face. However these presents which they gave me, since I began to give my attention to them, have made a different man of me; and now I personally can enjoy the pleasure of your honorable company.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then did Mr. Lying say, &#8220;There is one person who must be got out of the way before we can hope for any success, and that is old Sincerity. I know him from of old. He is so ignorant as to worldly standards, still I have never yet known one of our schemes to escape his eye. Then he is so unmanageable he will go and blaze it out before the faithful ones, and go over to the great camp and even work havoc there unless we can forestall his work in some way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Mr. Policy spoke up and said, &#8220;Now we all hate Mr. Sincerity very much, and among ourselves we know that he simply cannot be held in check; but that our moderation and love toward him might appear unto all, we must be careful of the wording with which we speak against him, that the faithful ones may be convinced that we are doing this work in the fear of God.&#8221;</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/A_True_Story_in_Allegory/Plans_to_Dispose_of_Sincerity/index.html">Plans to Dispose of Sincerity</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Plans to Dispose of Sincerity</h1>

<p>Now their first step was to warn the great camp of the saints against him by letter in which they wrote: &#8220;It is with sad hearts that we are compelled to warn you that Mr. Sincerity is no longer worthy of your confidence, as he has manifested a very bad spirit of division; therefore receive none of his reports.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then did Mr. Love-the-World make a suggestion, saying, &#8220;Now as to the local congregation, since they love Mr. Sincerity so much, and have such confidence in him, we would only defeat our own plans to renounce him at present. Therefore I suggest that our beloved kinsman take the pulpit this evening, and administer some of the &#8220;great praise&#8221; ointment from his vial. This will cause them to forget the excitement of the day, and also the cause. Then tomorrow while they are still dazed I will hold a fair with some of my most innocent-looking wares on exhibition; and while I have their attention, then our kinsman can dispose of old Sincerity as he shall see fit, and they will perhaps never miss him, or perchance if they do, you can again bring out the club, as they will then be too much weakened to put up much of a fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what can I do?&#8221; said Mr. Lustful-Eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;The best thing you can do at present is to keep still and out of sight, for it is mostly because of you and your luggage that all this commotion has come about, and the necessity for all these plans. Why, even the world would abhor us if they knew that you were among us!&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon this Mr. Lustful-Eyes exclaimed in anger, &#8220;I am your brother and have a right to be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Policy soothingly replied, &#8220;Yes, brother, but you know we will have to use wisdom or else the faithful ones will all lose confidence in us and consequently we will come to poverty.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment, seeing the depths of iniquity to which his relatives were bringing him, Mr. Hypocrisy found himself, as it were, standing alone upon a pinnacle of decision, such as comes to one at very critical times during life and in a burst of disgust, he exclaimed, &#8220;I feel like clearing you all out, and calling in the faithful ones and Mr. Sincerity to help. You are bringing me to ruin.&#8221; Whereupon Miss Vanity began to weep and told him what a disgrace it would be for a brilliant young man like him to humble himself before those little nobodies. This rather cooled his indignation, then Mr. Policy said, &#8220;I see a very short and easy way through this difficulty, if you will only keep yourself in my hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; said Mr. Lying, &#8220;I have a beautiful cover made that will hide all our faults, even to Brother Lustful-Eyes.&#8221; And Mr. Love-the-World assured him that he was quite sure he could soon have those faithful ones all duped so that they would never again be so particular about those little things. So with all this assurance, Hypocrisy continued his course as before planned.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/A_True_Story_in_Allegory/The_Success_of_Mr_Love_the_Worlds_Bazaar/index.html">The Success of Mr. Love-the-World&#8217;s Bazaar</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>The Success of Mr. Love-the-World&#8217;s Bazaar</h1>

<p>Next morning, the faithful ones who had received Mr. Hypocrisy&#8217;s dope the evening before, awoke feeling rather top-heavy, and instead of attending to their usual interview with the King, they decided to lay aside restraint for the day and resort to some place of pleasure. Mr. Love-the-World, foreseeing what would happen, had built his booths just at the edge of an innocent-looking picnic ground. There was one called sociability booth. In this place was to be had, free of charge, all manner of gossip and evil speaking, jokes and plays, in fact, about anything on the social line except hymns, spiritual songs, holy conversation, and godliness. Then came the booth for wearing apparel&#8212;fashions, freaks, and fancies&#8212;and some substitutes, such as those who did not want to bear the reproach of being very worldly could wear, and still not be reproached for being old-fashioned or peculiar. Then he had one booth for worldly honors. In it were all manner of certificates, medals, and medallions for those who would lay aside their narrow-mindedness, so that they might with their whole heart seek for his honors. Then he had a booth for the exhibition of all manner of religions for those who were not inclined to buy his other wares. So in all, his display was quite enticing to a company of heavy-headed, dim-eyed saints, and they forthwith set in to buy his goods, some at one booth and some at the other, according to their several inclinations. Of course, this was with the understanding that they should still be acknowledged by their pastor, Mr. Hypocrisy, who by this time was anxious for his flock to give attention to such things so that his own reproach might be removed. Also while they were thus engaged he had caught his adversary Mr. Sincerity, and, after binding him in chains, had sent him to an unknown destination.</p>

<p>Now, there were three of the faithful ones who had not accepted Mr. Hypocrisy&#8217;s dope, though they had refused it so quietly that no one had noticed the fact for the time being. They were Miss Perception, Old Mr. Steadfast, and his wife, Humility. So to the consternation of all, who should be seen coming toward the bazaar next morning but these three. Then did the faithful ones begin to feel somewhat uncomfortable, for they could see by the expression of their friends that they did not approve of the show. However, Mr. Love-the-World put on a bold face and asked them to buy his wares. At which Miss Perception answered, &#8220;No, thank you; for I perceive that your goods are of a very shoddy character and do not have the King&#8217;s seal upon them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said Mr. Steadfast, &#8220;I am very busy this morning and have no time for your trifles&#8221;; and so answered his wife. And so they went about their business, as they had received a commission from the King to perform some important errands that day.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/A_True_Story_in_Allegory/Forming_a_Committee/index.html">Forming a Committee</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Forming a Committee</h1>

<p>The next morning Mr. Hypocrisy and his relatives met to celebrate the success of having so far duped the faithful ones; and rid themselves of the troublesome Mr. Sincerity. The other three who had refused the dope were overlooked for the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mr. Love-the-World, &#8220;I believe things are now established upon a safe and sound basis, and therefore we can rest easy as to both our prestige and purse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; piped up Mrs. Apostasy, who had arrived during the night, and to whom a full statement of the facts had been given. &#8220;I have had much experience, and know that this loose-end way of running church affairs is not practical after they have come to the point where we now stand. For, you know, Old Sincerity has a great number of relatives of like disposition with himself, and they will give us endless trouble. There are his cousins, Love-God and Fearless, Great-Faith and Humility, and several others who care not even for their own necks, so unruly are they. The only thing I can see to be done is to form ourselves into a committee. Of course this must be kept quiet at first. And I have a copy of a set of laws and by-laws which I have used with very little variation for more than six hundred such boards. Of course, they can be elaborated upon after the faithful ones get more accustomed to them. They are worded in such a way that they can appear as anything or nothing, just as our convenience shall demand. Of course, there will be some who will accuse us of forming a sect, as this, in the minds of the faithful, is the greatest of sins. So when they thus accuse us, we can show our innocent by-laws&#8212;or not as we see best&#8212;and say, &#8216;Why, this is only a board of deacons, like they appointed at Jerusalem to serve tables&#8217;; but in reality we will be a board of bishops. But we will insert a few elusive words such as &#8216;advise,&#8217; &#8216;restrain,&#8217; etc., which appear nothing, but when enforced to their full meaning, there is really no limit to them at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now in regard to our prestige; this committee must be the only means through which anyone can expect to receive any information about church affairs. This will forever shut the mouths of the Sincerity family; and the eternal questioning about our doings will be stopped. Besides this we will very emphatically impress our infallibility upon the faithful ones, and make it a most heinous sin and heresy for them either to ask questions or to answer the same. This being accomplished one might think that the purse question were also settled. But there is another difficulty concerning this matter, as you will learn by experience with the faithful ones here. Now, since they have taken dope, and invested in our friend&#8217;s wares, you will see that they will find much less pleasure in supplying the needs of their pastor and other things pertaining to the King&#8217;s business.</p>

<p>&#8220;Moreover we must also send a committee of at least two&#8212;I think Mr. Policy and Mr. Love-the-World&#8212;out to visit all the flocks, to deal with them as this local flock has been dealt with; and to impress them, as we said, with our infallibility, with the heinousness of questioning us, and with the folly of narrow-mindedness. And you may be sure the effect will be the same in every place. Therefore some new scheme must be provided for money-getting lest our purse suffer loss.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, one of Brother Hypocrisy&#8217;s greatest sorrows during the past years has been that although he was a great man, still Old Sincerity has been receiving much the more funds. And upon our friend&#8217;s making complaint about the matter, Sincerity answered: &#8216;Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure&#8217;; &#8216;And there is that withholdeth more than is mete, but it tendeth to poverty&#8217;; and, &#8216;Give of thy gold, though small thy portion be: Gold rusts and shrivels in the hand that keeps it; It grows in one that opens wide and free; Who sows his harvest is the one who reaps it.&#8217; Besides that, Sincerity said in a most insinuating way that God gave him gold to use, not to love; and it came to his hands as if by magic. Now this is all right to preach to the flocks, but our friend, Hypocrisy, thinks as far as he is concerned that the Scripture, &#8216;Strong men retain riches,&#8217; is more applicable to him. And now that we may stop the gold from running through the hands of this openhanded Sincerity family, we must see that it all comes to our hands, so that we may have full control, and thus the unruly ones can be finished off by starvation, and our honorable relatives, who otherwise would receive nothing, will be well supplied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now the first step will be to have it all under our control; but lest under the circumstances there be not much to control, we must make giving compulsory, or at least a sort of article of faith so that there will be a stigma upon the one who does not give his part; and of course it won&#8217;t be much trouble to know just what that should be.&#8221; Upon this the meeting was adjourned, as there was not time to discuss other subjects until a later date.</p>

<h1>Trouble with the Faithful Ones</h1>

<p>After some time, the plan was found to be working well in the little camp. Mr. Love-the-World had held his bazaar every day during the time, and had added considerably to his stock. Mr. No-Conscience and Mr. Lustful-Eyes had become quite at home, in fact they had been promoted in the assembly with the assurance that if any of the Sincerity family undertook to give them trouble, that such troublers would be branded as unruly characters, and not only so, but as most unpardonable liars, who had persecuted the faithful; thus they would be put out of action forever. The preachers, Mr. Hypocrisy, Mr. Lying, and Mr. Policy, under the tutoring of Mrs. Apostasy, were busy teaching the faithful ones concerning their past folly and fanaticism, telling them that there was a much broader and easier way than by that of the cross, which always brought reproach and really kept many away who otherwise might be won.</p>

<p>Finally, one day, Miss Vanity noticed that her intendant was looking quite pale, and upon inquiry, found that he had been eavesdropping and had heard a conversation between those unruly ones, Miss Perception, Mr. Steadfast, and his wife, Humility. There was also with them a cousin of Mr. Sincerity by the name of Mr. Holy Boldness; and the conversation had gone thus:</p>

<p>Miss Perception: &#8220;I simply can&#8217;t see black white, or white as black; it matters not what they say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Steadtast: &#8220;No, none of these things move me at all, and I for one will stand against it if it takes me to the chopping block.&#8221;</p>

<p>Humility: &#8220;I am praying the Lord to shake the scales from the eyes of the little ones, if He has to use an earthquake to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Boldness: &#8220;Yes. I will pray also, but perhaps there is something we can do to answer our own prayers. Let&#8217;s quit ourselves like men, and expose and fight the thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this, Mr. Hypocrisy had nearly sunk into a swoon, for hitherto he had been overlooking those &#8220;insignificant ignoramuses,&#8221; as he had always called them.</p>

<p>Upon this news the committee was hastily called together to consult as to what should be done with these troublers. The decision was to tar and feather them as liars and accusers of the brethren; and thus make them an example to the flock. &#8220;But,&#8221; said Mrs. Apostasy, &#8220;things will never be satisfactory until we go in person to the great camp and get the whole camp under our jurisdiction. Now we need not all go at once, but let a delegation of the most expert ones be sent at once. Of course, I will superintend the business, but I think it would not be wise for me to take the pulpit at once, as this gay colored apparel of mine would at first bring a shock over the white robed company. Therefore appoint Mr. Policy to attend me as chief speaker, as we all acknowledge his pleasant manner, his wide knowledge, and his ability at turning his knowledge to best advantage for us.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Visit to the Great Camp</h1>

<p>Upon the arrival at the great camp, Mrs. Apostasy and Mr. Policy were extremely pleased to find a better welcome than they had expected, and they were able to discern that some of the &#8220;principal&#8221; ones had been taking some of the same &#8220;great praise&#8221; dope that had caused Mr. Hypocrisy&#8217;s downfall. Consequently there had been considerable disturbance among the faithful ones there, and some of the Sincerity family had been quietly renounced and set aside in other parts, also.</p>

<p>Mr. Policy thereupon was given the freedom of the pulpit. Now he, like his father, Beelzebub, was very expert at twisting scriptures. His first sermon was, &#8220;That your faith may stand in the wisdom of men.&#8221; He showed how many of the customs of the faithful ones were neither according to the wisdom of men, nor common sense. Then in his witty way he held up some of their peculiar views to great ridicule, saying, &#8220;Where is your scripture for this? See, you are doing this, and have given up that for no reason whatever.&#8221; Many, quite forgetting that the Word cannot be understood properly except by the Spirit, began to consider it from a human standpoint and were thus persuaded by him. Some of the &#8220;principal&#8221; ones sat on the front seat, smiling and rejoicing at the new light which had come at such an opportune time.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/A_True_Story_in_Allegory/Father_Discernments_Unprecedented_Conduct/index.html">Father Discernment&#8217;s Unprecedented Conduct</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Father Discernment&#8217;s Unprecedented Conduct</h1>

<p>Now, old Father Discernment just then entered the meeting, and upon seeing Mr. Policy in the pulpit, he began to roar out like a lion: &#8220;Beware! beware! faithful ones, this is a compromise of the devil. Flee for your lives! Do not lend your ears to this poisonous talk.&#8221; At this he, with several other of the fathers, sprang from their seats and with a large company of faithful ones, withdrew to a place apart.</p>

<p>Now, Father Discernment was held in very high esteem, both by the fathers and by the faithful ones, and because of this they had presented to him a castle called &#8220;Influence&#8221; upon a very high hill called &#8220;Position.&#8221; In this hill was also a gold mine. Now as he had forgotten all this in his zeal and roaring out, suddenly a thought-arrow pierced his head. It was shot from the bow of Mr. Self-Interest, who was the son of Old Honorable and his wife whose parental name was Covetous. This arrow turned his head in the direction of his estate, and there to his great sorrow he saw a party from the camp going thither as if to capture it. Now, he had his choice either to do as Moses did (Hebrews 11:24-26), or like Lot&#8217;s wife, to look back. The temptation was too much for him, therefore he betook himself to the castle, and seizing one of the bows of Mrs. Apostasy&#8217;s make, he began to hurl the arrows thick and fast into the little company which he so lately had led out of danger. Now for a long time the faithful ones had formed the habit of leaning entirely upon the understanding of Father Discernment, as it was much easier to inquire of him concerning a matter, than to seek an interview directly with the King; and because of this they had given him the castle and somewhat undue prominence. Therefore when they saw his unprecedented conduct they were thrown into utter confusion. Some took it for granted that he had suddenly seen his mistake in leaving the camp and in making such an uproar, so they, without asking any questions, returned to the camp and apologized for their strange conduct, though they knew not exactly why they did so. Others scattered hither and thither as the missiles from the castle fell thick and fast among them.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/A_True_Story_in_Allegory/Return_to_the_Mount_of_Inspiration/index.html">Return to the Mount of Inspiration</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Return to the Mount of Inspiration</h1>

<p>Suddenly, old Brother Circumspect, who had kept his wits through the whole affray, blew a trumpet which he always carried about with him, but had not been using of late for fear of offending certain ones. This called the scattered ones together, as they had in time past been accustomed to the sound of the old brother&#8217;s clear-sounding trumpet. Then he addressed them in the following manner: &#8220;Faithful brethren, let us not be as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time because the days are evil. Fear not, little flock, for there shall yet a remnant be saved. However I feel that I must repent before you because that for some time I have refrained from warning you, although God had appointed me as a watchman to warn His flock. But for fear of breaking the unity with many, I have not always been faithful.&#8221;</p>

<p>(Now this aforementioned great camp had once been pitched on the top of a mountain, called Inspiration Mount. But of late years it had been gradually moved downward toward a valley called the valley of Morality. This was done not through any bad motive, but a man called Mr. Worldly-Wise had made it his business to inform some of the Shepherds that, if they would pitch the camp in a lower altitude, they would be able to bring in many who were too sickly or lame or lazy to climb the steep mountain, as it was ascended by a steep and narrow pathway which meant a laying aside of all luggage and much weariness to the flesh. So they, without consulting the King, had taken his advice, thinking that when they had got their new converts strengthened to a certain degree, they could get them to move upward.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; Mr. Circumspect continued, &#8220;I warned them many times, so did my Brother Discernment, but we were put down as old fogies, cranks, etc., so we submitted for the sake of unity. I also found that some whom you would least suspect, were troubled with an affliction of the eyes, and would not use
the King&#8217;s eye-salve (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+3%3A18">Revelation 3:18</a>),
but preferred moving down into the fogs, as the sun is always bright upon the mountain. I warned them that the Compromise family would come along and capture them sometime, but they said, &#8216;Impossible! impossible! How could we be so deceived after knowing so much of the truth!&#8217; But now, you see, no one can descend to this valley and be safe. So let us hasten to our rightful place on the mountaintop.&#8221; Now on this mountaintop was a very large Rock in which they could hide safely, as in a fort, and though it appeared as a most common-place mount from the lowlands, still to those on the top it presented a most pleasing spectacle. There was a large lake of crystal waters which was supplied by a river that gushed from underneath the great Rock. Then, there were fruit trees in abundance, which supplied both food and medicine (Revelation 22:1,2), and the landscape was of unearthly beauty.</p>

<p>The little faithful ones were happy to find themselves once more in this place of safety. Still, some of them were perplexed because of the conduct of Brother Discernment. Whereupon they inquired of Brother Circumspect, who oftentimes called upon Brother Spiritual Understanding to help him in explaining difficult problems. (As it was, Brother Understanding, with a few others, had not followed the rest of the camp into the valley.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Now as to Brother Discernment&#8221;&#8212;for although he had received that title, still he had a human nature which is liable to err. Our adversary, knowing this, had prepared to overthrow him at a critical moment, by loading him with some of the honors of the valley, thus hoping to keep him there. And also to confuse those who had depended upon his wisdom.</p>

<p>&#8220;However,&#8221; continued Brother Circumspect. &#8220;Wise men of all ages have said that they always found it safest to act upon their first impression. They say that is God&#8217;s voice, and the afterthoughts are the human reasoning. Now we all know that our brother&#8217;s first impression was so strong that things were going wrong in the camp, that, disregarding all self-interest, or what others thought, he cried out and spared not. This was his discernment in the ascendency, and because of so many such exploits in the past he had received this title, not from the King, but from the faithful ones, who had also presented him with the castle. Then, when he changed his mind, was when the human began to reason, then that dart came, which turned his head toward the castle. I had warned him several times not to set his heart upon those things, and not to spend too much time digging around that gold mine. But alas! my brother!&#8221; Then they all wept to think of those left behind.</p>

<h1>Father Discernment&#8217;s Fate</h1>

<p>After the great upheaval in the valley, Mrs. Apostasy came forward and asserted herself to set things in order, saying, &#8220;Now as you see, there can be no order without my help,&#8221; though she too well knew that this was a lie, for she knew the true cause of the discord. But now she and her friends had succeeded in doping with the &#8220;great praise&#8221; ointment most of the congregation, so that they were too much confused and stupified to render her any answer, much less resistance. Then did they prepare themselves against another possible danger from Mr. Discernment. Now it was in this manner that they accomplished this task: First, they gave him the family dope; then did they punch out.his eyes; and then because of his name, his castle, and the hill upon which it stood, they could find no more suitable person to appoint as general overseer, and chief inspector of affairs. This appointment pleased him so much, that, though he was stone blind, he imagined himself to have infallible eyesight; and daily he could be found upon the walls of his castle, calling out in boastful tones, warnings against those who had escaped to the mountain, and to those who had not yet escaped: &#8220;Ho! Fools, can&#8217;t you see everything is all right, and just as it always has been? See this great camp which we have founded. Let none escape, lest we put you in chains&#8221;; for in this castle which was called Influence, was a dungeon in which they bound discontented ones, and refused to let them go.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/A_True_Story_in_Allegory/Plans_for_Curbing_Zealous_Young_Ministers/index.html">Plans for Curbing Zealous Young Ministers</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Plans for Curbing Zealous Young Ministers</h1>

<p>Now did Mr. Hypocrisy, his bride, and all her before-named relatives come to the camp to help Mrs. Apostasy in her work, for it was for their special convenience that this binding was being done. Having already attended to those things which concerned their prestige and purse, still Mr. Hypocrisy felt somewhat uneasy as to the future. Whereupon he was given leave to speak. Now, this was a private meeting, as it was even then not safe to divulge all his plans to the whole congregation. However, besides his relatives, Mr. Discernment who was now blind, was admitted, also Mr. Importance, Mr. Efficacy, Mr. Worldly-Wise, Mr. Anything, and some others of the &#8220;trustworthy&#8221; class. Then did he warn them of the danger of young shepherds who may rise here and there and do a great deal of harm to his cause, even before he should be able to find it out. &#8220;Now, if we would be safe, they must not be allowed to run at large.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we had one very notable case&#8212;away back before we got things in order&#8212;in Saul of Tarsus. Why! He just did what he thought God wanted him to do without even going up to Jerusalem and letting the Jews overhaul him or put any strings on him because of his peculiar views, which he said he had gotten by revelation. Neither would he confer with flesh and blood, but went right off to preaching to the heathen without any sanction from us. Of course, we renounced him and sent out a delegation to hamper him all they could; but we simply couldn&#8217;t manage him. Then we have had some others who persisted in following his advice. Of course, during the last half century, our cause has suffered much, but I believe that if we will do our best now we can stop this kind of thing. &#8220;Now, as we have our net woven we can pull the strings and soon have all our faithful ones warned not to receive anyone who does not carry a letter from us. This will deliver them into our hands. That being done I suggest that we start a training home, at least it will be called by that name, but in reality it will be a taming school for zealous young ministers. Of course, we have many theological seminaries where we undermine the faith, and even the belief in the authenticity of the Scriptures and the fundamentals of Christianity; these people are still afraid of those places for awhile, so I suggest that we advertise that we have a place for spiritual development, and that only graduates from this place need expect to be acknowledged as ministers. I have sketched out a course which I will present for improvement and criticism. Now, we will have different natures to tame, therefore we will need to use several distinct methods to bring about the desired result.&#8221;</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/A_True_Story_in_Allegory/The_Taming_School/index.html">The Taming School</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>The Taming School</h1>

<p>&#8220;Grade One: This grade will be for those who are a little high-headed, self-sufficient or inclined thereto. Upon admission to this class we will give a liberal solution of Mrs. Simpleton&#8217;s dope, mingled with a little More-Conceit and Glorying powder. If one should refuse this mixture he will be demoted at once to grade three, the by-laws of which we shall soon read. But in nine cases out of ten, they will take enough at least to give us a hold on them. After this refreshment, Mr. Worldly-Wise will give them a course of lectures on soul-winning, assisted, of course, by Mr. Policy who will give them a few points on unity and other kindred subjects. Then they will receive a shower of gold coins from myself, after which I will induce them, in company with my wife, to visit Mr. Love-the-World&#8217;s bazaar, where a large variety of wares of all sorts will be offered, and these will be all the more tempting because of their full purses. Now if they fully obey all instructions, this grade will soon be ready to go everywhere preaching my gospel.&#8221;</p>

<p>(Cheers and applause.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Grade Two: Now, as to grade two, we have a more knotty problem, and one which I would like to look square in the face and pass on, but I dare not, because of the danger. It is those very zealous fellows. They come from different walks of life, but whether they be learned or unlearned they are much the same; regular firebrands for their cause, and ready to fight with fire or wild beasts rather than to give in. Now the secret in taming them is in some way to quench that fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now the way to put out a fire is to cut off the fuel supply, and then throw cold water in abundance over what is already burning. By inquiry, I have learned that these fellows&#8217; fuel supply consists mostly of oil which can be had in plenty by those who will only take time to load up; and that the winds of persecution, spiritual conflict, and meeting difficult experiences in the King&#8217;s business tend to fan the flames. Therefore the way I have solved this problem is as I cannot cut off the supply of oil, to deprive them of time for refilling. Then I try wet blankets for doing the rest; that is, I will keep them as much as possible from such experiences as will tend to fan what little flame may be left.</p>

<p>&#8220;First, I have prepared a laundry and house-keeping course for these zealots. Just when they feel the fire burning the hottest and can scarcely stay in the house, I will tell them that they must be consecrated to wash, iron, sweep, tend babies ,and be general servants for my establishment and my first grade graduates: Moreover I will see that they are kept at it from early till late. Then if they will persist in filling up on the run and hoping still to win souls, in spite of their weariness of mind and body, will go to meeting at night and have the audacity to get up and preach, I will try the wet blanket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I will appoint my beloved wife and her sister, Miss Pickflaw, to escort them home. My wife shall say, &#8216;Quite a sermon, only it was not appropriate for the occasion. Besides, your appearance in the pulpit, I&#8217;m sure, did more harm than good. You know our congregation is of the better class and therefore our workers are expected to spruce up a bit. You&#8217;d better go over to the bazaar tomorrow and get some different looking clothes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Miss Pickflaw shall add, &#8216;Oh, yes, I noticed some of the people smiling at your awkward expressions and, really, your gestures were laughable; and besides, what did you mean? By what you said, you seem to be trying to set forth some ideas which we have discarded as obsolete. Now, if I were you, I would keep still until you have a chance to learn more, as we have plenty of the grade one class who can do the preaching.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I will see that they overhear a good many like remarks, while all the time we shall see that they are kept too busy for replenishing which is done by being still and reading their law. Now if I can do it, I will keep that book out of their hands a week at a time. Better give some spiritual work that he is not adapted to or has no calling for, as this method is a good cooler also, than to let them sit around and read that book and pray. My friend, Mrs. Strenuous, will help arrange those matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>All agreed that this course, if long enough, would likely prove successful.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Grade Two proves successful in its purpose&#8212;that is, quenching the firebrands&#8212;then be it resolved that they be promoted to receive the grade one course of lectures given by Mr. Worldly-Wise and Mr. Policy, then sent out to hold down a position.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grade Three: This is the most difficult grade of all as it is really for the delinquents from the first two classes. They will be known as the stubborns or untamables. This course will be purely spiritual as we shall then have proved that no combination of temporal and spiritual power will move them, therefore it must be very severe, of seven-fold heat.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will begin by accusing them of all sorts of spiritual wickedness, and tell them that it is very doubtful whether they were ever saved at all, much less called to preach. Then we will suggest that they had better repent, get married, of course to the wrong person, and settle down for life. For many who could never be defeated in any other way have been caught on this hook. If they listen to us in this, then we will get rid of them peaceably and doubtless permanently. If not, then we will still hold that they are possessed of a preach spirit which is of the devil and unless they repent they must go from this establishment, placarded as crooks, deceivers, accusers of the brethren, unruly, and altogether unworthy of confidence. You know, for a young shepherd to start out alone, and with everybody suspecting him, besides, perhaps, a few misgivings about his own spirituality, which we will be able to fasten upon him, will make the future look somewhat hopeless, besides affecting his own power and freedom. Of course, at one time, such people could be dealt with by torture and inquisition, but since the laws do not allow us to use those any more, we have to use spiritual weapons which do the desired work slowly but more surely as they affect both soul and body.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then did Mr. Policy interrupt, saying, &#8220;And if they survive this course, what?&#8221; after which there was a pause.</p>

<p>Then Mr. No-Conscience said, &#8220;I suppose we will just have to take the consequences:&#8221;</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/A_True_Story_in_Allegory/Sounding_the_Trumpet/index.html">Sounding the Trumpet</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Sounding the Trumpet</h1>

<p>The committee had no more than finished their plans for getting things into their kind of order, than they were disturbed one day by a great blast of a trumpet, sounding from the heights of the mountain which overlooked the valley. They had, of course, taken for granted that those insignificant folk who had made their escape, had been scattered to the four winds, and would never have the courage to give trouble to such a great company of great people as themselves. There is something about the mist of this valley which causes the objects therein to appear much taller than they really are, so that a very ordinary person appears as a walking giant, especially to himself.</p>

<p>However, several of the little faithful ones had already found their way to the mountaintop. There they found some of the Hold-Fast family, who had always remained there at home, and who, upon giving them welcome, and hearing the news from the valley, had set to blowing the trumpet to call any stragglers who might be groping their way up from the valley. Many times had the Apostasy family tried to destroy that most annoying trumpet, but it was set up in such a high altitude and in such an impregnable position, that they had never been able to do aught but, for a season, to in some way deceive the trumpeters, for a short time, into the idea that it was no longer necessary.</p>

<p>Then was Mr. Hypocrisy overwhelmed with sorrow and vexation to think that those people would persist in spoiling his plans. For, as long as that trumpet gives out a clear and certain sound, there will always be someone preparing to give him battle.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/A_True_Story_in_Allegory/The_Cleansing_Laver/index.html">The Cleansing Laver</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>The Cleansing Laver</h1>

<p>Then did the faithful ones who had escaped, begin to prepare for those who should afterward escape. Sisters Mercy and Hope took up their position just above the mist line on the road that led up from the valley, and there they set up a little laver in which the escaped ones could wash. Now the reason for this was that as many had descended to the valley, not through any bad motive of their own, but because they had been told by their shepherds that they would sin to separate themselves from the camp by not descending, and so they, thinking it their duty to listen to these false shepherds, had descended into the mist. Now, in this valley are many defilements that are hidden from the eyes of the inhabitants, because of the thick fog, which in time forms as scales over their eyes. Therefore unless a very strong light is turned upon them, they can never by any means be persuaded that they are at all changed from what they were while on the mountain top. So, when upon hearing the trumpet, they undertake to escape, after a difficult climb upon their hands and knees up through the mist, they come to daylight point. There the sunlight breaks upon them. Just at that point is also a mile-post with the following inscription written upon it:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Who shall ascend into the hill of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>? or who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+24%3A3-4" title="Psalm 24:3-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 24:3-4)</span></a></span>
Upon seeing this sign they proceed to take out their
mirrors (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+1%3A23">James 1:23</a>),
which they have carried with them all the time but had not been able to use to advantage, owing to their partial blindness. There in the light of the Sun shining upon their mirrors, they are able to discern many spots and blemishes upon their person; and then are they much disheartened because they had allowed themselves to be so deceived, and would scarcely have courage to proceed further, were it not for Mercy and Hope who then appear upon the scene, to refresh them and help them to the laver, where they can wash and be clean and sent on their journey. Also, those whose eyes have been very badly affected, become healed by the waters of this laver, so they can see the way clearly.</p>

<h1>Experiences with the Harshness Family</h1>

<p>Now, some time after Mercy and Hope had been at this place they heard a most pitiful moaning in the way beneath them, and knowing that it must be some of the escaped ones who had met with some danger, they descended for a short distance into the darkness. There they found three sweet maidens lying among the rocks wounded and bleeding. Their names were Love-Good, Honesty, and Seek-Truth who upon hearing the blast from the trumpet, had started on a pilgrimage to find from whence the sound came. They had come from a village called Dim Light which lieth somewhat to the left side of the mountain pathway. Now they had never been on the mountain height before but had been worshiping with a little holiness band, who were also seeking to know the way more perfectly, and although they had never reached daylight point, they were striving to find the way thereto.</p>

<p>Now, as these three maidens were feeling their way up the mountain side, they had come upon a cave at the mouth of which sat a man in the garb of the Shepherds. Then they inquired of him the way to the place where the trumpet was being sounded. He then told them that he had been stationed at that place for the express purpose of entertaining inquirers and helping them on their way to the heights. And he called his mother and two sisters to welcome the new-comers.</p>

<p>Now the truth about this family was that they were not the King&#8217;s servants at all, but they were of the Apostasy family, and had been stationed at that place to turn pilgrims back into the darkness, or if they had no mind to turn back, to put an end to them if possible. His name was Mr. Harshness, his mother&#8217;s name Cruelty, and his two sisters, Mote Picker and Inquisition. Soon after the arrival of the three maidens at the cave did Miss Mote Picker approach them, saying that she would like to be of some benefit and encouragement to them, and went on to say that she felt there must be something very wrong about them, otherwise they would never have lived in the village of Dim Light, and she had noticed by their conversation that they were still under the law and of course no one could be saved and believe that kind of nonsense. Whereupon the maidens in sorrow and astonishment said that they were born and brought up in Dim Light, therefore how could they help living there, and as to the law, why, they had been taught from childhood that it was their Christian duty to keep the Sabbath and to do other things contained in the law; but that if they knew that it was God&#8217;s will, they were willing to change their ways.</p>

<p>Now was Miss Mote Picker in such a rage that she was deaf to all their explanations and then did she call to the rest of the family, saying, &#8220;Here, see these crooks, imposters, children of the devil, let us rid ourselves of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, let us beat them,&#8221; said the mother. &#8220;Torture them,&#8221; responded Miss Inquisition. Then did &#8216;Brother&#8217; Harshness say many insulting things to them. They give themselves to weeping and said, &#8220;How much better if we had never heard that trumpet, for then would we have been content to dwell back in Dim Light.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then did Miss Inquisition place thumbscrews upon their hands and try to force them to confess many things of which they had not so much as dreamed. And Mr. Harshness then accused them of the sin of accusation and division, because he had overheard them saying that they had never seen the like of this in Dim Light. Then, one day, as Miss Inquisition had failed to draw from them the required confession, she called the other members of the family to see if they could diagnose the case, to which Mote Picker answered that she could see by their faces that they had no love for her nor for the other members, who were the Church of the living God. She said also that she never heard any expressions of joy from them, especially of late.</p>

<p>Then did Harshness stand forth with a great club in his hand, and with a roaring voice that made the maidens shrivel up in a corner, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t love us, we&#8217;ll beat you until you do; and more than that, if I don&#8217;t hear you take to shouting &#8216;Glory&#8217; soon, I&#8217;ll raze you to the ground.&#8221; Now their quietness had caused Mr. Harshness much anxiety, because he liked in all outward things to imitate the camp at the mountaintop. In fact, this family did dress so plainly that at first sight they would be mistaken for one of the faithful ones; and so did they in many other of the outward ordinances.</p>

<p>This they did that they might the better draw into their cave those pilgrims to whom Mr. Love-the-World&#8217;s bazaar did not appeal. For, even in Dim Light, the people had light on the dress subject, and there have been pilgrims all along who could not be enticed into that bazaar. However, the maidens were too sad to shout or sing for joy, and they were too sincere to feign joy, so they said, &#8220;How can we be joyful in such a place as this?&#8221; This saying, of course, cast a reflection upon the work of the Harshness family, and therefore did they cast the maidens out, but not until they had beaten them, cut them with sharp arrows, and broken them.</p>

<p>Then were the three sisters in a most pitiful plight and one said, &#8220;Would that we had been content to stay in Dim Light, for now we will be ashamed to return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; said Seek-Truth, &#8220;I cannot say that I am content to return there, I still believe that there is something better than we have yet seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this they did begin to look about them, still moaning from their wounds and bruises. And, a short way above them did they discover a row of white pillars as of a boundary line, and upon each of the pillars was an inscription. Then did they read upon the first one:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>&#8217;s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+2%3A2" title="Isaiah 2:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 2:2)</span></a></span>
Then did they perceive that they were still off the mountain here referred to. This would have been very disheartening had they not at that moment seen two figures coming toward them, and in the most gentle tones offering to help them up the pathway. Then were their hearts comforted and well nigh overjoyed to find the way. And then did Mercy lead them to the laver, while she and Hope bound up their wounds. And they did lead them into the camp of the faithful, where they received such a welcome that they forgot all their former sorrows.</p>

<h1>The Inhabitants of the Valley</h1>

<p>Then did many others find their way to the mountaintop; some from one city and others each from their respective towns and hamlets, which do lie in the valley that surrounds this mountain. For the valley is all under the control of the Apostasy family, even Gog and Magog. But as on this morality plain there are &#8220;many men of many minds,&#8221; so the adherents of each separate opinion betake themselves to a little village by themselves. Now in this valley were more than six hundred of these villages of which we can mention only a few, although at times pilgrims may be seen making their escape from any one of them. There was one village by the name of Anti-Christ; in it dwelt Mrs. Christian Science, Miss New Thought, Miss Theosophy, and their mother, Mrs. Hinduism, also their aunt, Mrs. Paganism who is the mother of Mrs. Papacy, whom we all know to have been the mother of all the Apostasy family. Now the dear people of this village believe that salvation is within themselves, and although they speak of the Jesus Christ, in whom their cousins profess to believe, still they do reject the doctrine of His atoning sacrifice.</p>

<p>One morning, as some of the members of this family were walking out a long distance, they did come upon one of the boundary posts of the mount on which was inscribed in large letters the name &#8220;Jesus,&#8221; and under it these words:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+14%3A6" title="John 14:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 14:6)</span></a></span>
And,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+4%3A12" title="Acts 4:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 4:12)</span></a></span>
Then were they all pricked to their hearts and did begin to fear and tremble, lest after all they should be found to be thieves and robbers, because they were seeking to climb up some other way. Then did they discover a little pathway, from the post which led to the heights and brought them to the camp of the faithful, after first having met Mercy and Hope, who had ministered unto them and encouraged them in the way of truth.</p>

<p>There was also a camp of Israelites in this valley, who not only rejected Jesus but who were building their hopes upon the works of the law. Then was there also a sister village called Good Works. Some of the inhabitants of this village were Mrs. Philanthropy, Mrs. Social-Reform, Mrs. Much-Talk, Mrs. Make-a-Show, and Mrs. Formality. Now, these ladies had worked together in harmony for many years. They had been especially helpful to the Apostasy family in keeping up the expense of their camp; and in exchange for their labor they had received many promises of everlasting bliss in the world to come, and much praise in this world.</p>

<p>Now, one day a good shepherd did come to their town and exhorted them to flee to the mountain, as their city was soon to undergo a severe earthquake and fire; and all of their good works would never be able to save them. &#8220;For,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it is not by works of righteousness that we shall be saved, but by believing in the mercy of the Son of God. For this is the work of God, that ye believe on the Son of God.&#8221; Then did some of their company flee to the mountain, and when they came to daylight point, they were almost overwhelmed to find that not only had their works been left behind, but that they had many blemishes which had to be cleansed away in Mercy&#8217;s laver, before they were fit company for the faithful ones.</p>

<h1>Postscript</h1>

<p>One morning, while it was still dark, a shining One from above did enter the camp and awaken old Brothers Faithful, Witness, and Prophesy, and told them to follow Him. This they did and He led them to a very high crag called Revelation Point and there did they get a glimpse of that celestial country which lieth somewhat near to this point. Then did such a glorious light shine upon them, the likeness of which can never be described, as though the glory of a thousand flaming, golden sunsets had in a moment burst upon their vision. Then were they overwhelmed with ecstasy and emotion, while o&#8217;er the vale which intervened a chorus as of a thousand angels&#8217; voices was wafted to them upon the zephyrs of that heavenly world. Then were their souls so thrilled with joy and devotion that they fell prostrated before the presence of His majesty. Then did the shining One bid them return to the camp, to strengthen their brethren; &#8220;For now have you seen the glory of the Lord and your souls are vibrating with the harmonies of heaven&#8217;s music. Return unto them,&#8221; I say, &#8220;and hold a convocation, and a reading of the law of the Lord, that they may be edified and built up in the most holy faith, and in a knowledge of the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now the record of this convocation which they held may be found in the annals of Mt. Zion.</p>
