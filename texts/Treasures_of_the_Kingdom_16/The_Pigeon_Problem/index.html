<h1>The Pigeon Problem</h1>

<p>Everyone had been happy when Dad found work at Wilken&#8217;s Bird Farm on the other side of town. Everyone had been happy, that is, until the day Dad brought home the pigeons. <i>A pair for each of us big kids,</i> Daniel thought, as he eyed the eight birds in the cage. Two silver blue pigeons stood out among the white and gray ones: those were the ones he wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re homers,&#8221; Dad said, handing the cage to Chad. &#8220;We can build them a loft next to the chicken house and you can learn how to fly them.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_16/pigeon_daniel.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="347" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Can we each have one, Daddy?&#8221; Rosie asked excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got them for you children to enjoy,&#8221; Dad said. &#8220;There are plenty to go around.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Daniel didn&#8217;t think so. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think Emma&#8217;s too little?&#8221; he asked Chad as they carried the cage to the shed. &#8220;She won&#8217;t know how to take care of them, and besides, there are only four pairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want some pigeons, too,&#8221; Emma piped up at his elbow. &#8220;I can help feed them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; Irene said. &#8220;There are enough for all of us, aren&#8217;t there?&#8221; Chad and Rosie agreed, but Daniel didn&#8217;t think it was fair.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>By the following week a cozy loft stood behind the shed and the pigeons were released inside. Daniel watched the silver-blue male, Big Blue strut around. Mr. Wilken had said that he was an experienced racer and raised good squabs. <i>If I can&#8217;t have Big Blue and his mate, I won&#8217;t have any at all,</i> Daniel decided.</p>

<p>Chad said Emma could pick first. &#8220;I like that pure white one,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Rosie and I like the blue pair,&#8221; Irene added. Daniel glared at her, but she didn&#8217;t seem to notice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Especially the hen&#8212;she&#8217;s so pretty,&#8221; agreed Rosie.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I wanted the blue male,&#8221; Daniel said with a growl.</p>

<p>&#8220;You could have him and we could have the hen,&#8221; suggested Irene.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Mr. Wilken said we shouldn&#8217;t separate the pairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He also said the blue ones can&#8217;t be raced,&#8221; Chad put in. &#8220;Let the girls have them and we can have that gray pair to train for racing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I just won&#8217;t have any pigeons,&#8221; Daniel said stubbornly.</p>

<p>Irene looked surprised. &#8220;Daniel&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_16/pigeon_pigeons.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="147" /></div>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what you say&#8212;you&#8217;re mean!&#8221; Daniel cut in, and stomped toward the house. <i>It&#8217;s not fair,</i> he complained to himself. <i>Irene said we could share and just see how selfish she is herself!</i> He slammed the screen door with a bang. <i>I&#8217;m not going to share with Chad either&#8212;he doesn&#8217;t even know what a good pigeon looks like.</i></p>

<p>That night Daniel pretended not to notice when Chad and Irene began looking over the new Pigeon-Raiser&#8217;s Guide. <i>I really don&#8217;t care, anyway,</i> he told himself, and began poking at the fire.</p>

<p>Dad sat down in a nearby chair. &#8220;So, Daniel, how did your pigeons like their new loft?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have any pigeons,&#8221; Daniel said glumly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chad didn&#8217;t give me a chance to pick and the girls were being selfish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about you? Were you acting like Jesus would want you to?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel shrugged and turned away. <i>I guess I&#8217;m as good as they were,</i> he thought. Rosie&#8217;s excited voice made him think of pigeons again, and he suddenly felt lonely. <i>They always leave me out, and everyone thinks they&#8217;re good. But they&#8217;re not!</i></p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>It was three days later when Irene came in with a cold, dead bird. Its strong wings lay stiffly against a silver-blue body and Daniel recognized Big Blue at once. &#8220;Where did you find him?&#8221; Chad asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Near the door; but he wasn&#8217;t acting normal yesterday,&#8221; Irene said. &#8220;Maybe it was the bread the girls gave them.&#8221; She ran to get the pigeon book.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ooo, poor bird,&#8221; Emma murmured. Daniel turned away with a sick feeling. <i>Why did she have to act so innocent? She probably killed him and wasn&#8217;t even sorry.</i></p>

<p>On the way out to get firewood, Daniel stopped by the loft. His fingers clenched as he watched the blue hen sit mournfully by herself. A gust of cold wind whipped at his face and the loft door swayed open and banged against the chicken coop. <i>Ha! Look how responsible they are!</i> Daniel sneered to himself. <i>I guess they can find the pigeons when they get loose.</i> He turned away without a backward look.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_16/pigeon_coop.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="384" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mama! The pigeons are all gone!&#8221; Rosie cried, bursting into the kitchen less than an hour later. Daniel was silent, but the others gathered around excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; asked Chad. &#8220;Did you leave the door open?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; moaned Irene. &#8220;I think I forgot to latch it after getting&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was wide open,&#8221; cut in Rosie, &#8220;and I don&#8217;t see any of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re homers and so they will fly home,&#8221; said Chad.</p>

<p>&#8220;So they will be at Mr. Wilken&#8217;s! Let&#8217;s call and see, please?&#8221; But no one at the farm had seen anything of the birds, and Mr. Wilken didn&#8217;t think they would likely make it in through the storm.</p>

<p><i>What do I care? It serves them right,</i> thought Daniel as they sat down to eat. But he stirred his soup dismally, and felt miserable.</p>

<p>Dad must have noticed, for after reading the story of Queen Esther that night, he took Daniel on his lap. &#8220;What&#8217;s troubling you, my boy? Thinking about the lost pigeons&#8212;the ones that aren&#8217;t yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he mumbled. He didn&#8217;t feel like joking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been making your own gallows?&#8221; Daniel looked up in surprise. &#8220;When Mordecai didn&#8217;t bow down, Hamen made gallows to kill him,&#8221; Dad reminded him. &#8220;But who hung on them in the end?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and he didn&#8217;t get much happiness out of his revenge either.&#8221; Dad said. &#8220;Daniel, Jesus wants you to be happy, but you can&#8217;t be with such a selfish heart.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Irene was worse,</i> Daniel told himself, but Dad continued, &#8220;You can blame others for your problems, but the Lord looks at your heart. God is fair, but have you been?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel thought of the open loft door. <i>But they deserved it because&#8230;.</i> He tried to remember how selfish Irene had been, but instead he saw her sad look when he had shouted at her. Daniel blinked, trying to forget; but his brain pounded with all the mean things <i>he</i> had thought and done. A few tears began to trickle down his cheeks and he threw his arms around Dad&#8217;s neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we pray for Jesus to make you a new boy, Daniel?&#8221; Burying his aching head in Dad&#8217;s shirt, Daniel nodded. Yes, it was Jesus&#8217; forgiveness and happiness he wanted most of all.</p>
