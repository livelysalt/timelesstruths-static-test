<h1>If Sinners Entice Thee</h1>

<p>The first time that Billy noticed the man was when he was coming home from school. The man had a white beard and very blue eyes. He was pushing the most beautiful mountain bicycle that Billy had ever seen. It was just Billy&#8217;s size, and it looked brand new.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi, Billy!&#8221; said the man. &#8220;Can you help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy wondered how the man knew his name. He remembered how Mother had told him to never, never take candy from strangers. But this man wasn&#8217;t offering candy. He was asking for help.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I get to the school?&#8221; asked the man.</p>

<p>Billy told the man how to get to the school. The man thanked him and pushed the wonderful mountain bike toward the school.</p>

<p>It was next week before Billy saw the man again. This time, he was pulling some large boxes behind him on a garden wagon. The boxes had pictures of a computer on them. One of the pictures showed a boy looking at the computer and typing on the keyboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi, Billy!&#8221; said the man. &#8220;I just bought a new computer. I got it on sale, but I don&#8217;t know how to use it. Do you know someone who could help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy was quiet. He didn&#8217;t know this man, but it looked as if he needed help. &#8220;It&#8217;s not that hard,&#8221; Billy said, finally.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just want to send some letters to my little boy. I don&#8217;t get to see him much because they took him away from me.&#8221; Billy wondered what the man was doing with a boy&#8217;s mountain bike last week if he didn&#8217;t hardly ever see his little boy.</p>

<p>The man went on talking. &#8220;I bought a bike last week for a boy named John. He said he would help me if I gave him the bike. I was supposed to meet him at the school, but he never showed up. Could you help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy thought a moment. &#8220;Well,&#8221; Billy said, &#8220;my dad and I could help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t need much help,&#8221; the man said quickly. &#8220;I would hate to bother your dad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy&#8217;s dad was very busy. &#8220;Mother and I could help you,&#8221; Billy offered.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no need to bother your parents at all,&#8221; the man said, smiling. &#8220;I just need a little help. If you could do it, I&#8217;d give the bike to you. If you don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll like it, you could even keep the bike at my house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother and Daddy are my best earthly friends!&#8221; Billy said very firmly. &#8220;I am not going do anything without telling them.&#8221; With a frown, the man hurried away.</p>

<p>After Billy told his parents about what happened, they called the police. Then Dad took out the Bible and read:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+1%3A8-10" title="Proverbs 1:8-10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 1:8-10)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>&#8220;That man tried to entice you,&#8221; Mother said, &#8220;and I&#8217;m very glad you didn&#8217;t consent.&#8221;</p>
