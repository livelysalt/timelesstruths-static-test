<h1>The Pigeon Problem</h1>

<p>Everyone had been happy when Dad found work at Wilken&#8217;s Bird Farm on the other side of town. Everyone had been happy, that is, until the day Dad brought home the pigeons. <i>A pair for each of us big kids,</i> Daniel thought, as he eyed the eight birds in the cage. Two silver blue pigeons stood out among the white and gray ones: those were the ones he wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re homers,&#8221; Dad said, handing the cage to Chad. &#8220;We can build them a loft next to the chicken house and you can learn how to fly them.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_16/pigeon_daniel.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="347" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Can we each have one, Daddy?&#8221; Rosie asked excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got them for you children to enjoy,&#8221; Dad said. &#8220;There are plenty to go around.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Daniel didn&#8217;t think so. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think Emma&#8217;s too little?&#8221; he asked Chad as they carried the cage to the shed. &#8220;She won&#8217;t know how to take care of them, and besides, there are only four pairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want some pigeons, too,&#8221; Emma piped up at his elbow. &#8220;I can help feed them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; Irene said. &#8220;There are enough for all of us, aren&#8217;t there?&#8221; Chad and Rosie agreed, but Daniel didn&#8217;t think it was fair.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>By the following week a cozy loft stood behind the shed and the pigeons were released inside. Daniel watched the silver-blue male, Big Blue strut around. Mr. Wilken had said that he was an experienced racer and raised good squabs. <i>If I can&#8217;t have Big Blue and his mate, I won&#8217;t have any at all,</i> Daniel decided.</p>

<p>Chad said Emma could pick first. &#8220;I like that pure white one,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Rosie and I like the blue pair,&#8221; Irene added. Daniel glared at her, but she didn&#8217;t seem to notice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Especially the hen&#8212;she&#8217;s so pretty,&#8221; agreed Rosie.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I wanted the blue male,&#8221; Daniel said with a growl.</p>

<p>&#8220;You could have him and we could have the hen,&#8221; suggested Irene.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Mr. Wilken said we shouldn&#8217;t separate the pairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He also said the blue ones can&#8217;t be raced,&#8221; Chad put in. &#8220;Let the girls have them and we can have that gray pair to train for racing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I just won&#8217;t have any pigeons,&#8221; Daniel said stubbornly.</p>

<p>Irene looked surprised. &#8220;Daniel&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_16/pigeon_pigeons.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="147" /></div>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what you say&#8212;you&#8217;re mean!&#8221; Daniel cut in, and stomped toward the house. <i>It&#8217;s not fair,</i> he complained to himself. <i>Irene said we could share and just see how selfish she is herself!</i> He slammed the screen door with a bang. <i>I&#8217;m not going to share with Chad either&#8212;he doesn&#8217;t even know what a good pigeon looks like.</i></p>

<p>That night Daniel pretended not to notice when Chad and Irene began looking over the new Pigeon-Raiser&#8217;s Guide. <i>I really don&#8217;t care, anyway,</i> he told himself, and began poking at the fire.</p>

<p>Dad sat down in a nearby chair. &#8220;So, Daniel, how did your pigeons like their new loft?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have any pigeons,&#8221; Daniel said glumly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chad didn&#8217;t give me a chance to pick and the girls were being selfish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about you? Were you acting like Jesus would want you to?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel shrugged and turned away. <i>I guess I&#8217;m as good as they were,</i> he thought. Rosie&#8217;s excited voice made him think of pigeons again, and he suddenly felt lonely. <i>They always leave me out, and everyone thinks they&#8217;re good. But they&#8217;re not!</i></p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>It was three days later when Irene came in with a cold, dead bird. Its strong wings lay stiffly against a silver-blue body and Daniel recognized Big Blue at once. &#8220;Where did you find him?&#8221; Chad asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Near the door; but he wasn&#8217;t acting normal yesterday,&#8221; Irene said. &#8220;Maybe it was the bread the girls gave them.&#8221; She ran to get the pigeon book.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ooo, poor bird,&#8221; Emma murmured. Daniel turned away with a sick feeling. <i>Why did she have to act so innocent? She probably killed him and wasn&#8217;t even sorry.</i></p>

<p>On the way out to get firewood, Daniel stopped by the loft. His fingers clenched as he watched the blue hen sit mournfully by herself. A gust of cold wind whipped at his face and the loft door swayed open and banged against the chicken coop. <i>Ha! Look how responsible they are!</i> Daniel sneered to himself. <i>I guess they can find the pigeons when they get loose.</i> He turned away without a backward look.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_16/pigeon_coop.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="384" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mama! The pigeons are all gone!&#8221; Rosie cried, bursting into the kitchen less than an hour later. Daniel was silent, but the others gathered around excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; asked Chad. &#8220;Did you leave the door open?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; moaned Irene. &#8220;I think I forgot to latch it after getting&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was wide open,&#8221; cut in Rosie, &#8220;and I don&#8217;t see any of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re homers and so they will fly home,&#8221; said Chad.</p>

<p>&#8220;So they will be at Mr. Wilken&#8217;s! Let&#8217;s call and see, please?&#8221; But no one at the farm had seen anything of the birds, and Mr. Wilken didn&#8217;t think they would likely make it in through the storm.</p>

<p><i>What do I care? It serves them right,</i> thought Daniel as they sat down to eat. But he stirred his soup dismally, and felt miserable.</p>

<p>Dad must have noticed, for after reading the story of Queen Esther that night, he took Daniel on his lap. &#8220;What&#8217;s troubling you, my boy? Thinking about the lost pigeons&#8212;the ones that aren&#8217;t yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he mumbled. He didn&#8217;t feel like joking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been making your own gallows?&#8221; Daniel looked up in surprise. &#8220;When Mordecai didn&#8217;t bow down, Hamen made gallows to kill him,&#8221; Dad reminded him. &#8220;But who hung on them in the end?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and he didn&#8217;t get much happiness out of his revenge either.&#8221; Dad said. &#8220;Daniel, Jesus wants you to be happy, but you can&#8217;t be with such a selfish heart.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Irene was worse,</i> Daniel told himself, but Dad continued, &#8220;You can blame others for your problems, but the Lord looks at your heart. God is fair, but have you been?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel thought of the open loft door. <i>But they deserved it because&#8230;.</i> He tried to remember how selfish Irene had been, but instead he saw her sad look when he had shouted at her. Daniel blinked, trying to forget; but his brain pounded with all the mean things <i>he</i> had thought and done. A few tears began to trickle down his cheeks and he threw his arms around Dad&#8217;s neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we pray for Jesus to make you a new boy, Daniel?&#8221; Burying his aching head in Dad&#8217;s shirt, Daniel nodded. Yes, it was Jesus&#8217; forgiveness and happiness he wanted most of all.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_16/The_Gallows_of_Revenge/index.html">The Gallows of Revenge</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>The Gallows of Revenge</h1>

<p>Do you know what gallows are? They are a way to kill someone by hanging them by their neck. Would you want to be choked to death by a rope? I doubt it! Just think how it would feel to be squeezed tighter and tighter until your head felt like exploding. That is what &#8220;getting even&#8221; does to you inside. All the good things are squeezed out. As Daniel learned in this story, revenge doesn&#8217;t bring happy results.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he deserves it!&#8221; you say, when your pestering little brother gets in trouble. &#8220;Serves him right for what he did to me.&#8221; Revenge makes us think only that <i>you</i> are good and <i>he</i> is bad. But is that true? When you blame someone else you don&#8217;t look at your own problems. But it is your own bad attitude that makes you unhappy.</p>

<p>There are many ways you can &#8220;choke&#8221; out the blessings of life. When you can&#8217;t go to your friend&#8217;s house you say, &#8220;Now my day is ruined!&#8221; and feel gloomy. You are feeling bad because you are choking your own self. When someone does something mean, you plan a way to get him back. But that only starts a &#8220;revenge war&#8221; and no one is happy. When something doesn&#8217;t go your way you can say, &#8220;It&#8217;s their fault!&#8221; But when you blame others you are unfair and unhappy.</p>

<p>So how do we get free from the gallows? God&#8217;s love is the answer. How can we love those that bother and hurt us? We must pray for Jesus&#8217; help to take away our selfish heart and give us <i>His</i> heart of love. When we have Jesus&#8217; love, we want to do good and be kind to others. Let God do the revenging, because He is fair.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_16/The_Pleasing_Porpoise_Goodness/index.html">The Pleasing Porpoise: Goodness</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>The Pleasing Porpoise: Goodness</h1>

<p>You may have never seen this animal, for it lives in the ocean waters with the fish and sharks. But unlike other ocean animals, many porpoises and dolphins enjoy being around people.</p>

<p>Bump! What was that? You turn and see a smooth, dark head poke its rounded nose out of the water and looks at you with curious eyes. This friendly animal likes to play water games, but is also glad to help those in trouble. Dolphins have been known to hold up drowning people, scare away sharks, and even guide boats through dangerous waters!</p>

<p>We can learn kindness and helpfulness from the porpoise. Instead of doing everything for themselves, they want to please others. If many people are around, they are glad to spend time with everyone. When someone needs help, do they first ask, &#8220;Will you help me back?&#8221; No, they just want to be kind, no matter if the person never helps them. Not everyone is so caring as these animals can be.</p>

<p>This attitude of caring is called <i>goodness</i>. It is easy to be good to those that are good to us. That is called copycatting, isn&#8217;t it? If you want to be friends, I&#8217;ll be friendly, but if you hit me, I&#8217;ll hit you back. Anyone can do that. But God is always good&#8212;to everyone. His goodness is much better than the copycat kind. And He can help us be kind and make others happy, even if they are not our friends. When your sister or brother are annoying you, ask God to help you be kind anyway. When we think about how good God is to give us sunshine and rain, health, family, and food, then it is easier to be good to others. When we are kind, it will make others want to be good, too.</p>

<h1>Project, poem, and verse</h1>

<h2>On Cooperation</h2>
<p>To cooperate means to work together. Think of a pair of scissors&#8212;it cuts so well because the two parts work together. Try this out with someone near your size:</p>

<p>Sit on the floor, back to back, and link your arms together at the elbows. Now try to stand up with your arms still linked. If you try one at a time you will pull each other down. If you both <i>work together</i> and push your backs together you will be able to stand up. Can you do it?</p>

<p>Cooperation is very useful to practice every day. It makes the chores go much faster. Brother moves the chairs while you sweep, or he can put away the toys while you fold clothes. And when you are doing a project, cooperation makes it easier. You can mix while sister measures ingredients, or maybe Dad needs someone to hold the board while he nails it. Even when we play games we need to cooperate for everyone to have fun. What if you wanted to play &#8220;hide and seek&#8221; and no one hid?</p>

<p>God has many good plans for us, but we need to cooperate with Him by <i>listening</i> and <i>obeying</i>. Then our lives will be easier and happier!</p>

<h2>The Quarrel</h2>
<p class="author">Eleanor Farjeon</p>

<p class="verse">I quarreled with my brother,
<br />I don&#8217;t know what about,
<br />One thing led to another
<br />And somehow we fell out.
<br />The start of it was slight
<br />The end of it was strong,
<br />He said he was right,
<br />I knew he was wrong.</p>

<p class="verse">We hated one another.
<br />The afternoon turned black.
<br />Then suddenly my brother
<br />Thumped me on the back,
<br />And said, &#8220;Oh, <i>come</i> along!
<br />We can&#8217;t go on all night&#8212;
<br /><i>I</i> was in the wrong.&#8221;
<br />So he was in the right.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t do it,&#8221; Alice told Grandpa, when she had to help pay for the broken rocker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe we aren&#8217;t always fair,&#8221; Grandpa agreed, &#8220;but God is. Did you ever hear of what happened to the Israelites after they won the battle of Jericho?&#8221; The children gathered around to listen.</p>

<h1>The Judgment After Jericho</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Joshua+7">Joshua 7</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">It had been a marvelous thing to watch the walls of Jericho tumble down. The women and children had watched excitedly as the city went up in flames that night. Aksah was full of questions when her father, Caleb, came home to camp. &#8220;Did you save anything when you burned the city?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joshua said everything must be destroyed except for a few things for the Lord&#8217;s treasury,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a great day for Israel; surely the Lord will help us subdue the rest of this land.&#8221; Her father had waited forty years in the wilderness for this day, Aksah knew. He was ready to conquer.</p>

<p>But soon sorrow hung over the camp. A small city called Ai had been their next target, but when soldiers were sent out to take it, they had been shamefully defeated. Thirty-six men had been killed and now the whole camp was frightened. &#8220;What went wrong?&#8221; Aksah wondered. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t God help us?&#8221; Father looked pale and distressed as he hurried away to join Joshua before the ark of the Lord.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must all gather in the morning,&#8221; he said when he returned late. &#8220;Something was taken from Jericho, and the Lord has said we can&#8217;t stand before our enemies unless the curse is removed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aksah was quiet as she stood with her family in the tribe of Judah, waiting for the lots to be cast. A tingle ran down <i>her</i> spine when her tribe was taken. Who could it be? She looked around at the faces of her relatives and sighed in relief when the Zarhites were picked. She stepped closer to her father, who stood to one side with a sad, but determined look. They watched the heads of the families walk before Joshua, then man by man. A man named Achan was chosen.</p>

<p>&#8220;My son, tell the truth before God,&#8221; Joshua said in the hush of that moment.</p>

<p>Achan dropped his head. &#8220;Indeed I have sinned before the Lord,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When I saw in Jericho a fine garment and silver and a wedge of gold, I took them. They are hidden in my tent.&#8221; Messengers were sent and they soon came back with the things Achan had taken. Now he and all he had must be stoned and burnt with fire because he had sinned and caused so much trouble.</p>

<p>It was a solemn crowd that followed Joshua down to the nearby valley. Aksah didn&#8217;t want to watch as the men picked up stones to throw at the wicked man and his family, but she knew God was fair. As the flames leapt up into the air, she gave a long sigh. How serious a thing it was to disobey God! Even though Achan had tried to hide it, the Lord knew all along.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Alice looked quite solemn after Grandpa had finished the story. &#8220;But why did they have to stone them?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;That was terrible!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they had been really bad and disobeyed God,&#8221; Sammy said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Grandpa. &#8220;The Lord gave some hard judgments on the people that sinned against His commands, but that was because their hearts were hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Edward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because they couldn&#8217;t have their hearts changed back then. Now we can, because Jesus came as an offering to die <i>instead</i> of us and so that God would accept us again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean, we would have to be killed for our sins, except that Jesus died instead?&#8221; said Alice. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize that before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is why Jesus came&#8212;to bring peace on earth, as the angels told the shepherds,&#8221; said Grandpa with a smile. &#8220;You see, God is both fair <i>and</i> loved us so much that He sent His only Son&#8230;&#8203;why?&#8221;</p>

<h1>Joe Benton&#8217;s Coals of Fire</h1>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_16/coals_cave.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="157" /></div>
<p>It was a lovely spring morning; the sun was shining brightly, when Joe Benton sprang out of the back door. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have time to run to the brook before breakfast and see if my boat is all right,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;We boys are to meet and launch her at nine o&#8217;clock, and the captain ought to be up on time.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Joe hastened down to the cave where the precious boat was hidden. As he neared the place, an exclamation of surprise escaped him. The big stone before the cave had been rolled away. Hastily drawing forth his treasure, he burst into loud cries of dismay; for there was the beautiful little boat which Cousin Herbert had given him, with its gay sails split into many shreds, and a large hole bored in the bottom.</p>

<p>Joe stood motionless with grief and surprise; then, with a face as red as a peony, he burst forth: &#8220;I know who did it! It was Fritz Brown, and he was angry because I didn&#8217;t ask him to come to the launching. But I&#8217;ll pay him back for this,&#8221; said Joe. Hastily pushing back the ruined boat, he went a little farther down the road. He fastened a piece of string across the footpath a few inches from the ground and carefully hid himself in the bushes.</p>

<p>Presently a step was heard, and Joe eagerly peeped out. How provoking! Instead of Fritz, it was Cousin Herbert, the last person he cared to see. Joe tried to lie very quiet; but it was all in vain. Cousin Herbert&#8217;s sharp eyes caught a curious movement in the bushes, and, brushing them right and left, he soon came upon Joe. &#8220;How&#8217;s this?&#8221; cried he, looking straight into the boy&#8217;s face. &#8220;You&#8217;re not ashamed to tell me what you were doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not,&#8221; said Joe sturdily, after a short pause. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you the whole story.&#8221; Out it tumbled, down to the closing threat. &#8220;I mean to make him smart for it,&#8221; said Joe.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Fritz carries a basket of eggs to the store every morning, and I plan to trip him over this string, and make him smash all of them.&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_16/coals_talking.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="261" /></div>
<p>Now Joe knew well enough that he was not showing the right spirit, and he muttered to himself, &#8220;Now for a good scolding.&#8221; But to his great surprise Cousin Herbert said quietly, &#8220;Well, I think Fritz does need some punishment, but this string is an old trick; I can tell you something better than that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; cried Joe eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How would you like to put a few coals of fire on his head?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, and burn him?&#8221; said Joe doubtfully.</p>

<p>Cousin Herbert nodded with a queer smile.</p>

<p>Joe clapped his hands. &#8220;Now that&#8217;s just the thing, Cousin Herbert. You see, his hair is so thick he wouldn&#8217;t get burned much before he&#8217;d have time to shake them off; but I&#8217;d like to see him jump once. Tell me how to do it, quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220; <span class="scripture">&#8216;If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink: For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> shall reward thee,&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+25%3A21-22" title="Proverbs 25:21-22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 25:21-22)</span></a></span>&nbsp;&#8221; said Cousin Herbert gravely. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s the best kind of punishment Fritz could have.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joe&#8217;s face lengthened terribly. &#8220;Now, that&#8217;s no punishment at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try it once,&#8221; said Cousin Herbert. &#8220;Treat Fritz kindly, and I am certain he will feel so ashamed and unhappy he would far rather you had given him a severe beating.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joe said sullenly: &#8220;You said this kind of coals will burn, and they don&#8217;t at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re mistaken about that,&#8221; said his cousin cheerily. &#8220;I have known such coals to burn up a great amount of rubbish&#8212;malice, envy, ill feeling, revenge&#8212;and then leave some cold hearts feeling as warm and pleasant as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joe sighed. &#8220;Well, tell me a good coal to put on Fritz&#8217;s head, and I&#8217;ll see about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; said Herbert, smiling, &#8220;Fritz is poor and he can seldom buy himself a book, although he loves to read. Now you have quite a library. Suppose&#8212;ah, well, I&#8217;ll leave you to find your own coal. But be sure to kindle it with love, for no other fire burns so brightly and so long.&#8221; With a cheery &#8220;good-by,&#8221; Herbert sprang over the fence and was gone.</p>

<p>Before Joe had time to collect his thoughts, he saw Fritz coming down the lane with a basket of eggs in one hand and a pail of milk in the other.</p>

<p>For one moment Joe thought: &#8220;What a smash it would have made if Fritz had fallen over the string!&#8221; Then he stopped, glad that the string was safe in his pocket.</p>

<p>Fritz looked uncomfortable, but Joe began abruptly: &#8220;Fritz, do you read much now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes,&#8221; said Fritz, &#8220;But the trouble it, I&#8217;ve read everything I can get hold of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How would you like to take my new book of travels?&#8221;</p>

<p>Fritz&#8217;s eyes danced. &#8220;Say, would you let me? I&#8217;d be careful with it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Joe, &#8220;and perhaps I&#8217;ve some others you&#8217;d like to read.&#8221; Then he added shyly: &#8220;Fritz, I would ask you to come and help sail my boat today; but someone has torn up the sails, and made a hole in the bottom. Who do you suppose did it?&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_16/coals_flag.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="433" /></div>
<p>Fritz&#8217;s head dropped, but then he looked up, and said: &#8220;I did it, Joe. I can&#8217;t begin to tell you how sorry I am. You did not know I was so mean when you promised me the books.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I rather thought you did it,&#8221; said Joe slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet you&#8212;&#8221; Fritz couldn&#8217;t get any further. He rushed off without another word.</p>

<p>&#8220;That coal does burn. I know Fritz would rather I had smashed all his eggs than to have offered him that book.&#8221; So Joe went home with a light heart, hungry for his breakfast.</p>

<p>When the captain and the crew of the little vessel met at the appointed hour, they found Fritz there before them trying to repair the damage. When he saw Joe, he held out a beautiful little flag he had bought for the boat with part of his egg money that morning. The boat was repaired, and everything turned out as Herbert had said.</p>

<p>Joe found that the more he used of this curious kind of coal, the larger supply he had on hand&#8212;kind thoughts, kind words, and kind actions. His playmates, who saw that he was always happy, soon said when there was any trouble: &#8220;Let us try a few of Joe Benton&#8217;s coals.&#8221; It was astonishing to see how quickly their hearts grew warm toward each other.</p>

<h2>Something You Can Do</h2>
<p>When you get your hands all dirty, what is something that is good to do?</p>

<p>Wash them with soap! Soap suds are good at cleaning and they make your hands smell nice, too. Here is a project to make &#8220;scrubbing up&#8221; more fun.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_16/something_steps.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="405" /></div>
<h1>Carve a Good-Porpoise Soap</h1>

<p>You will need:</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_16/something_soap.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="61" /></div>
<ul>
<li>a bar of soap (a softer kind)</li>

<li>a knife that Mommy says you can use</li>

<li>newspaper, paper, and a pencil</li>

</ul>
<ol>
<li>Set the soap bar on the paper and trace around it. Now draw your porpoise design on the paper like this:</li>

<li>Put your design on top of the soap and trace it with the pencil. Press hard enough to make dents in the soap.</li>

<li>Now it is carving time! Lay out the newspaper to protect the table. Begin by cutting away small chunks from the edge of the soap bar. Keep carving until you get to the dent lines.</li>

<li>Finish up your porpoise by making the body rounded and smooth. Poke a little hole for the eye.</li>

</ol>
<p>Now gather all the soap scraps together and mold them into a ball. It will be good for cleaning, too. When you have put everything away, you can try out your good-porpoise soap.</p>

<p>Or, give it is as a gift to show goodness to someone else!</p>

<h1>The Jesus Answer for Selfishness</h1>

<p>Me&#8212;my way&#8212;I want! Do you ever think that way? We all do, because we are born just thinking about ourselves. Mommy and Daddy teach us to be kind and to obey, but selfishness is still inside. You think, &#8220;If I just hurry and get my chores done, then I can play more.&#8221; But what if Mom needs help in the kitchen or brother wants you to do something with him? Our selfishness says &#8220;No, no, no!&#8221; You frown and drag your feet, and Mom has to discipline you for a bad attitude. Selfishness is a PROBLEM.</p>

<p>Did you know that for every problem we have, Jesus has the answer?</p>

<p>First we need to use our <i>mouth</i> to ask God to help us <i>want</i> to do right. Jesus always wanted to do what His Father wanted, even if it was hard. He will help us be <i>determined</i>, too.</p>

<p>If we ask Him, Jesus will give us His <i>heart of Love</i>. Jesus wants to do good to others because He loves them. When we really love others, we will want to make <i>them</i> happy. We will not have &#8220;me-me&#8221; in our heart, but &#8220;how can I please Mommy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jesus&#8217; hands were always reaching out to help others. If we keep busy doing kind and loving things, we will be Jesus&#8217; hands for Him. If we want to be a <i>Christian</i>, we have to be like Christ, don&#8217;t we?</p>

<p>How can we use our legs for Jesus? By following Him like His disciples did so long ago. We follow Him by obeying what He tells us in the Bible. Jesus always did what was right, and if we follow Him, we can, too. Let Jesus lead the way.</p>

<h1>If Sinners Entice Thee</h1>

<p>The first time that Billy noticed the man was when he was coming home from school. The man had a white beard and very blue eyes. He was pushing the most beautiful mountain bicycle that Billy had ever seen. It was just Billy&#8217;s size, and it looked brand new.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi, Billy!&#8221; said the man. &#8220;Can you help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy wondered how the man knew his name. He remembered how Mother had told him to never, never take candy from strangers. But this man wasn&#8217;t offering candy. He was asking for help.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I get to the school?&#8221; asked the man.</p>

<p>Billy told the man how to get to the school. The man thanked him and pushed the wonderful mountain bike toward the school.</p>

<p>It was next week before Billy saw the man again. This time, he was pulling some large boxes behind him on a garden wagon. The boxes had pictures of a computer on them. One of the pictures showed a boy looking at the computer and typing on the keyboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi, Billy!&#8221; said the man. &#8220;I just bought a new computer. I got it on sale, but I don&#8217;t know how to use it. Do you know someone who could help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy was quiet. He didn&#8217;t know this man, but it looked as if he needed help. &#8220;It&#8217;s not that hard,&#8221; Billy said, finally.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just want to send some letters to my little boy. I don&#8217;t get to see him much because they took him away from me.&#8221; Billy wondered what the man was doing with a boy&#8217;s mountain bike last week if he didn&#8217;t hardly ever see his little boy.</p>

<p>The man went on talking. &#8220;I bought a bike last week for a boy named John. He said he would help me if I gave him the bike. I was supposed to meet him at the school, but he never showed up. Could you help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy thought a moment. &#8220;Well,&#8221; Billy said, &#8220;my dad and I could help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t need much help,&#8221; the man said quickly. &#8220;I would hate to bother your dad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy&#8217;s dad was very busy. &#8220;Mother and I could help you,&#8221; Billy offered.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no need to bother your parents at all,&#8221; the man said, smiling. &#8220;I just need a little help. If you could do it, I&#8217;d give the bike to you. If you don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll like it, you could even keep the bike at my house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother and Daddy are my best earthly friends!&#8221; Billy said very firmly. &#8220;I am not going do anything without telling them.&#8221; With a frown, the man hurried away.</p>

<p>After Billy told his parents about what happened, they called the police. Then Dad took out the Bible and read:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+1%3A8-10" title="Proverbs 1:8-10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 1:8-10)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>&#8220;That man tried to entice you,&#8221; Mother said, &#8220;and I&#8217;m very glad you didn&#8217;t consent.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Princess,</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_16/letter_making.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="238" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Ring the bells, shout the news! Let the whole world know&#8212;tell the people everywhere what the prophet said is so; God, the Son, has come to earth&#8230;.&#8221; Precious was busy making gifts for her family to remember God&#8217;s big gift of sending them Jesus. A snowflake kit was just right for Joy&#8212;and Precious could make that herself!</p>

<p>Carefully Precious printed out directions for different patterns, and smiled as she thought of Joy&#8217;s excitement. Gifts were so much fun to make! Some Precious had made, and others she had bought with her &#8220;Just Newborn&#8221; doll savings. Precious had earned almost enough to buy it, but giving to others came first. Precious knew the verse, <span class="scripture">&#8220;It is more blessed to give than to receive.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+20%3A35" title="Acts 20:35"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 20:35)</span></a></span></p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_16/letter_jar.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="270" /></div>
<p>She remembered the doll she had wanted at Goodwill. She could still afford a cheap baby, even if she spent some of her savings for presents. But Princess Precious felt ashamed of how she had acted that day. She did not feel she deserved a new doll at all, neither a cheap or expensive one. It would be better to give gifts to those who were worthy.</p>

<p>The air was crisp and cold, as Mama and Precious set forth to finish up Christmas shopping. Entering the big Walmart, they squeezed through the crowded rows. Suddenly, Precious caught sight of a lovely doll&#8230;&#8203;one that looked really alive. &#8220;Oh Mama, look!&#8221; Precious exclaimed, before she could even think.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is a beautiful doll, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221; Mama reached up and lifted her off the shelf. She was the same size as &#8220;Just Newborn,&#8221; but her skin felt as soft as a real baby, and when Precious took her in her arms, she felt just like baby brother at home. As Precious stroked the pink dress, the baby suddenly began to cry&#8212;almost like real. The only way to make it stop was to put the bottle in its mouth. But the price was $35. That was too much money for any baby, and besides, she had come to buy gifts for others.</p>

<p>Mama said, &#8220;We had better do our shopping, dear; let&#8217;s go.&#8221; It was exciting to look for gifts, and Precious put the doll out of her mind. She certainly could not deserve it. Precious chose a cookie turner for Mama, a stick-on watch for Daddy, and a pen that changed colors for Valiant. By the time she had finished, her bag was full, purse was empty, and feet were tired.</p>

<p>Precious awoke Christmas morning to Mama playing on the piano, with Daddy&#8217;s deep voice singing away. She slipped downstairs to the crackling fire in the living room. Her packages were by the manger scene, and baby Jesus was quite surrounded with loving gifts. All together the family sang about Jesus&#8217; birth, and then acted out the story with the Nativity figures. Precious could have done that all day. Next Mama began passing out gifts, and Precious passed out hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a neat pen, thanks!&#8221; Valiant called across the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love the snowflakes&#8230;&#8203;&#8221; Joy whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can always use a cookie turner!&#8221; Mama smiled at her. &#8220;And you did a good job sewing these pot holders.&#8221; Precious smiled happily. Her own presents were forgotten in the joy of watching the others open her gifts. Then Mama handed her a large package.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_16/letter_doll.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="277" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Mama&#8230;&#8203;?&#8221; Precious couldn&#8217;t believe she was holding the wonderful doll again. &#8220;Why, Mama, I don&#8217;t deserve such a doll&#8212;not after how I was&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mama held Precious close. &#8220;God sent a gift of love that we didn&#8217;t deserve. Remember that each time you hold your baby. And remember it as a gift of love and forgiveness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll call her Carol,&#8221; Precious whispered. &#8220;To remember the Christmas carols of God&#8217;s love and forgiveness in sending Jesus to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Have a wonderful Christmas!</p>

<h1>Dear Reader</h1>

<p>As this year has come to a close, we are thankful to God for His gracious help and care of us. If anyone doesn&#8217;t know our King and dwell within His palace gates, we pray that this little paper would make you desire it. As we think of the Savior&#8217;s birth, please consider the reason: <span class="scripture">&#8220;to give light to them that sit in darkness&#8230;&#8203;to guide our feet in the way of peace.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+1%3A79" title="Luke 1:79"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 1:79)</span></a></span></p>

<p>If you have questions or want to share a testimony, please write. If you want more encouragement for Christian living, <i>Foundation Truth</i> is also available for youths and adults.</p>

<p>We are a Bible-believing family that includes Rick and Krista Erickson and their five children: Laura (21), Skye (20), Joel (19), Kara (16), and Amanda (8). The publishing of <i>Treasures of the Kingdom</i> is mainly done by Laura and Joel, with help (guidance, proofreading, contributions) from others.</p>
