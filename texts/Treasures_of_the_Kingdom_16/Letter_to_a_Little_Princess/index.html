<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Princess,</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_16/letter_making.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="238" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Ring the bells, shout the news! Let the whole world know&#8212;tell the people everywhere what the prophet said is so; God, the Son, has come to earth&#8230;.&#8221; Precious was busy making gifts for her family to remember God&#8217;s big gift of sending them Jesus. A snowflake kit was just right for Joy&#8212;and Precious could make that herself!</p>

<p>Carefully Precious printed out directions for different patterns, and smiled as she thought of Joy&#8217;s excitement. Gifts were so much fun to make! Some Precious had made, and others she had bought with her &#8220;Just Newborn&#8221; doll savings. Precious had earned almost enough to buy it, but giving to others came first. Precious knew the verse, <span class="scripture">&#8220;It is more blessed to give than to receive.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+20%3A35" title="Acts 20:35"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 20:35)</span></a></span></p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_16/letter_jar.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="270" /></div>
<p>She remembered the doll she had wanted at Goodwill. She could still afford a cheap baby, even if she spent some of her savings for presents. But Princess Precious felt ashamed of how she had acted that day. She did not feel she deserved a new doll at all, neither a cheap or expensive one. It would be better to give gifts to those who were worthy.</p>

<p>The air was crisp and cold, as Mama and Precious set forth to finish up Christmas shopping. Entering the big Walmart, they squeezed through the crowded rows. Suddenly, Precious caught sight of a lovely doll&#8230;&#8203;one that looked really alive. &#8220;Oh Mama, look!&#8221; Precious exclaimed, before she could even think.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is a beautiful doll, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221; Mama reached up and lifted her off the shelf. She was the same size as &#8220;Just Newborn,&#8221; but her skin felt as soft as a real baby, and when Precious took her in her arms, she felt just like baby brother at home. As Precious stroked the pink dress, the baby suddenly began to cry&#8212;almost like real. The only way to make it stop was to put the bottle in its mouth. But the price was $35. That was too much money for any baby, and besides, she had come to buy gifts for others.</p>

<p>Mama said, &#8220;We had better do our shopping, dear; let&#8217;s go.&#8221; It was exciting to look for gifts, and Precious put the doll out of her mind. She certainly could not deserve it. Precious chose a cookie turner for Mama, a stick-on watch for Daddy, and a pen that changed colors for Valiant. By the time she had finished, her bag was full, purse was empty, and feet were tired.</p>

<p>Precious awoke Christmas morning to Mama playing on the piano, with Daddy&#8217;s deep voice singing away. She slipped downstairs to the crackling fire in the living room. Her packages were by the manger scene, and baby Jesus was quite surrounded with loving gifts. All together the family sang about Jesus&#8217; birth, and then acted out the story with the Nativity figures. Precious could have done that all day. Next Mama began passing out gifts, and Precious passed out hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a neat pen, thanks!&#8221; Valiant called across the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love the snowflakes&#8230;&#8203;&#8221; Joy whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can always use a cookie turner!&#8221; Mama smiled at her. &#8220;And you did a good job sewing these pot holders.&#8221; Precious smiled happily. Her own presents were forgotten in the joy of watching the others open her gifts. Then Mama handed her a large package.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_16/letter_doll.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="277" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Mama&#8230;&#8203;?&#8221; Precious couldn&#8217;t believe she was holding the wonderful doll again. &#8220;Why, Mama, I don&#8217;t deserve such a doll&#8212;not after how I was&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mama held Precious close. &#8220;God sent a gift of love that we didn&#8217;t deserve. Remember that each time you hold your baby. And remember it as a gift of love and forgiveness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll call her Carol,&#8221; Precious whispered. &#8220;To remember the Christmas carols of God&#8217;s love and forgiveness in sending Jesus to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Have a wonderful Christmas!</p>

<p class="signature">Love,<br />Aunt Grace</p>
