<h1>He Careth for Thee</h1>

<p>Life will never be successful unless we learn to let God care for us. Unless we have faith to know that God is our keeper and that hence we have nothing to fear, we shall never be the cheer and sunlight in this dark world that God designed us to be. This is a world of trouble. Sin envelops many souls in awful midnight gloom. Some may never find Jesus unless they see Him smiling in your face. You as God&#8217;s dear child are to be a light to those poor, benighted souls. To be such a light, you must be full of light, and to be full of light you must be full of hope by faith in the cheering and encouraging promises of God. None can be truly happy, none can be the cheer, comfort, and consolation to the world, who are bearing their own burdens. Only those who have learned the sweet lesson of trust in God and know that He cares for them are truly happy and free and capable of cheering others.</p>

<p class="verse">He who this one short life would live
<br />As heaven has designed
<br />Must scatter rays of cheering light
<br />From a heart with Hope enshrined.</p>

<p>There are many priceless promises in the Word of God. There is a promise for every need, condition, and circumstance of life. Among these blessed promises, here is one that has brought comfort to many a weary pilgrim on life&#8217;s way: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+5%3A7" title="I&nbsp;Peter 5:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 5:7)</span></a></span> If this promise does not lift you far above all the trials, discouragements, and weariness of life, it is because you do not believe it nor understand the fullness of its meaning. <span class="scripture">&#8220;He careth for <i>you</i>.&#8221;</span> It is not your neighbor or your friend, but it is <i>you</i>. Cares will come to you, certainly; you could never cast your cares upon God if you had none. But you have them and doubtless many of them. The difficulty with many is, they do not cast them on God. Reader, your life will never be, it cannot be, that free, happy, radiant, sunlit, helpful life that pleases God, if you bear your own cares.</p>

<p>There is nothing too trivial in life to take to God. In the very smallest concerns of your daily life He has an interest. In everything let your requests be known unto Him. Do learn to take everything to Him. Fret over nothing, never worry for a moment. Let nothing disturb or disquiet you. I say nothing. <span class="scripture">&#8220;He careth for you.&#8221;</span> Do you comprehend the full meaning of these words? Think them over for a moment. Let go of yourself and let God keep you. Oh, the freedom that belongs to the children of God! Theirs is a sweet land of liberty. But alas! how many will go on bearing their own burdens and weighted down with care with these words right before them: <span class="scripture">&#8220;He careth for you&#8221;</span>! Why not let Him?</p>

<p>Care is a grace-destroyer. If you would be strong in the grace of God, you must live free from care. It gnaws at the very vitals of the soul. A strong cable made of many fine wires was stretched across the river and was used to tow a heavy scow back and forth. One of the small strands was broken. This was thought to be a small matter. Soon another was broken and then another. Still this was not of much consequence. One by one more were broken but unheeded because each was so small. Finally all were broken, and the boat went adrift. A little care does not seem to be of much consequence. But the Bible says to <span class="scripture">&#8220;be careful for nothing,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+4%3A6" title="Philippians 4:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 4:6)</span></a></span> and to <span class="scripture">&#8220;[cast] all your care upon him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+5%3A7" title="I&nbsp;Peter 5:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 5:7)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Some have thought that the bearing of burdens and cares make us strong in the Lord. No, it is the casting of them on Jesus that makes us strong. For a man to be down under a heavy weight is no exercise to his muscles; but to be up on his feet and passing heavy weights on to another, this is exercise. To be down under burdens and cares is no exercise to the soul, but is really death; the passing of the cares on to Jesus is the exercise and the strength of the spiritual powers. If you only knew how much grace a little care destroyed, you would quickly cast them on Jesus. Some have come to find themselves entirely without grace because they did not cast their cares on the Lord. We knew a sister whose baby was such a care that she could not keep saved. One day when asked how she was getting along in the Lord, she answered, &#8220;Not well: the baby is such a care and worry that I cannot keep the victory I should like to have.&#8221; Was it not too bad to lay such a blame upon a poor, little, innocent child?</p>

<p>I was asked one time if it was possible to reach an experience where we would never fret or worry. Certainly we can. We shall never get to a place where we shall have no temptations, but we can get to a place where we shall not yield to the temptations. Your life has not reached that degree of perfection that it should, until you have attained to such an experience. Jesus says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Take&#8230;&#8203;no thought for the morrow.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+6%3A34" title="Matthew 6:34"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 6:34)</span></a></span> When you are having any great anxieties about future things, you are doing what Jesus tells you not to do, and you cannot do something He tells you not to do without suffering spiritual loss. Oh! why will you worry about anything, when Jesus says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Be [anxious] for nothing.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+4%3A6" title="Philippians 4:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 4:6)</span></a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; you say, &#8220;when there is no meat in the larder and no flour in the bin, can we then be not anxious?&#8221;</p>

<p>There are those who have been in just such circumstances and yet have not been greatly troubled.</p>

<p>If you will be over-anxious about anything, you can never live close to God. When anxieties knock at the door of your heart for admittance, and you open the door and let them in, you are opening the door to a dangerous band of robbers. They are robbers of grace and peace. When anxieties step over the threshold of your heart&#8217;s door, grace and peace fly out of the window. &#8220;But what am I to do?&#8221; sighs a care-worn soul. Do just what a good man says he did. He said that he opened his heart to Jesus, and He came and shut the door. Let Jesus keep the door of your heart. When anxieties come and want into your heart, tell them they must get permission from Jesus, because you have given your whole heart up to Him. This is what is meant by <span class="scripture">&#8220;casting your care upon him.&#8221;</span> It is not enough to kneel down and ask Jesus to take them; you must cast them upon Him. In this is the soul&#8217;s needed exercise. The soul that will do this shall be strong. You must put the burden over on the Lord&#8217;s shoulders and let Him bear it. He will bear all your burdens for you if you will lay them upon Him.</p>

<p>Not only must you put them upon Him, but you must let go entirely. You do not even need to look after them to see what He does with them. Your little child comes to you with a tangled cord. It gives it over into your hands, but holds to one end. Now, you know that in order to get the tangle out, you must have both ends. O weary one, Jesus will disentangle all the cares of life, but you must let Him have both ends. He does not want your help. You hinder Him if you attempt to help Him. Cares will come; things that are of a trying nature will assail us as long as we live. But we have a refuge in Jesus; He will bear our burdens; He will care for us.</p>
