<h1>The Best Dentist</h1>

<p>I was playing tag at a campground with some friends younger than myself, and was intently running when a girl who was also running swiftly collided with me. It happened so fast I only knew it as I lay moaning on the ground, &#8220;Oh, my tooth, my tooth!&#8221; I was sure it was only hanging by a few nerves, it hurt so.</p>

<p>Eventually I was led to a nearby bench and lay there crying; why had this happened to me? The voice of God spoke to me, &#8220;Remember you told Me you had no faith I could heal anybody, only to clean up hearts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that I said, &#8216;I can persuade you that I have that kind of power, too&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, I remembered; He had told me that.</p>

<p>In my mind I was no longer lying on a picnic bench, but was in the dentist&#8217;s chair, my old dentist exclaiming, &#8220;Now how did you do that?! It&#8217;s going to be a bit painful, here&#8230;.&#8221; Then I turned and was surprised to see Jesus looking at me. In a twinkling He put on the dentist apparel&#8212;apron, mask and cap&#8212;which were lying on a table before Him. He looked big and strong, yet His manner bespoke gentleness; and His eyes&#8212;I never had seen His eyes with that look in them before&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;full of compassion&#8230;&#8203;and of great mercy.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+145%3A8" title="Psalm 145:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 145:8)</span></a></span> &#8220;I love you,&#8221; they said. I glanced at the regular dentist. Compared to Him, she looked rather shriveled up and shrunk in size. I shrugged my shoulders&#8212;not much of a choice, I thought; Jesus would do with one hand tied what that lady could at her ultimate best. &#8220;I choose You,&#8221; I whispered.</p>

<p>My tooth hurt horribly. With one probing finger I could &#8220;see&#8221; that it was pushed back halfway from its proper place to the roof of my mouth. It was not both front teeth as I had first feared; just the left one. But I couldn&#8217;t touch it; it hurt too much. I told Him that I simply couldn&#8217;t touch it, couldn&#8217;t stand it, let alone move it (as He had just said to do). Then He said, &#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll need this,&#8221; and He got out, to my amazement, one of those syringes and deftly filled it with whatever it is that deadens the nerves. Closer it came to my mouth and I shut my eyes (as I always do) so I wouldn&#8217;t have to see the wicked needle. And then my upper gum, left side, began to feel numb, until it was like I&#8217;ve felt before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; He said, &#8220;pull your tooth forward.&#8221; I put my finger behind and pushed. It came forward until it was a tooth&#8217;s width away from its real position.</p>

<p>At this point I became aware of the little crowd watching me. Suddenly feeling self-conscious, I sat up holding the tooth forward; little by little the crowd melted except my parents and a few other adults.</p>

<p>It must have been near to suppertime, for we went to the dining area and I sat at one of the tables. Most of the girls my age acted as though they thought I was a baby for sitting there holding up my tooth (for if I let up on the pressure, the pain would make me wish I could twist out of my body and leave it).</p>

<p>Then Jesus came by my lonely spot at the table; behind me He whispered, &#8220;Push it up some more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; I said, &#8220;it hurts too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you can,&#8221; He said. So I tried once more. And behold! It was so numb in that gum that I could not feel it unless I touched it with my finger. So I pushed up and outward until it was level with my other big tooth and got it wedged between the teeth on each side so it no longer slipped.</p>

<p><i>I was happy</i>; I realized Jesus cared for me whether others did or not. And He sure could throughly take care of the things I had to go through.</p>

<p>That numbing was deeper than any dentist I&#8217;ve ever had and lasted longer, too, and when it went away, it did not have that funny tingle; it just slipped away like it had come, so quietly.</p>

<p>I love this Doctor.</p>
