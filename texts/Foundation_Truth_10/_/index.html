<h1>Dear Reader</h1>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world: But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+4%3A3-5" title="Galatians 4:3-5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 4:3-5)</span></a></span></p>

<p>What a precious thing it is to live in the time when this deliverance from bondage to the elements of the world is available! I&#8217;m thinking today, however, of those for whom that came too late to experience in this life. There were many in the Old Testament who felt their need of a clean heart (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+51">Psalm 51</a>), but Immanuel had not yet come. Generation after generation of people who wanted to please God sought &#8220;instinctively,&#8221; if you will, for the blessing of being adopted as sons of God, but did not experience it in this life. Yet, <span class="scripture">&#8220;in due time Christ died for the ungodly.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+5%3A6" title="Romans 5:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 5:6)</span></a></span></p>

<p>God is fair, and though they didn&#8217;t obtain the heart experience of the new covenant, yet the merits of Christ&#8217;s blood were sufficient to make a home in heaven available to them also, although limited to the terms of the Old Covenant in their pilgrimage down here.</p>

<p>On a lesser scale than this, the issue of timing runs all through the history of humankind. Millions of Jews and others perished in Germany before the liberating armies arrived&#8212;yet they came in time for others. Would it have been appropriate for those in the liberating armies to think (if they became aware of what had already happened), <i>We&#8217;re too late for so many, it wouldn&#8217;t be fair to rescue just a few at this point?</i> A mother or father dies before their children are grown&#8212;do we say it is unfair for others to be able to raise their children to adulthood? Looking back at the spread of the gospel&#8212;is it fair that many in the area around the eastern Mediterranean received the good news in the first century, and some isolated tribes in the twenty-first century are getting their first exposure now?</p>

<p>The answer to these questions lies in the goodness and power and justice of God. God deals with everybody, in every age, in every place, and deals with each according to the light and understanding they have had available and responded to. At the same time, He continues to work within the limitations of time and space and free will to bring more and more light to all.</p>

<p>In our little place in His work I am both comforted and encouraged to press on. Though the issue has been long delayed, I&#8217;m trusting that it might be <span class="scripture">&#8220;the fulness of the time&#8221;</span> or <span class="scripture">&#8220;due time&#8221;</span> for somebody who is looking to the Lord for help, and that the Lord hears our prayers that we be able to be more timely with our next issue. We greatly desire and appreciate your prayers.</p>

</blockquote>


<h1>What Are You?</h1>

<p>&#8220;What are you, dear friends?&#8221; he began; &#8220;that is our subject today. What are you? How many different answers I hear you make, as you answer my question in your hearts!</p>

<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;What am I?&#8217; you say. &#8216;I am a fisherman, a strong, active man, accustomed to toil and danger.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;I am a mother, with a large family of little ones, working hard from morning till night.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;I am a schoolboy, learning the lessons which are to fit me to make my way in the world.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;I am a busy merchant, toiling hard to make money, and obliged to come to this quiet place to recruit my wearied energies.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;I am an artist, with great ambition of future success.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;I am an old man, who has weathered many a storm, but my work is done now; I am too old to fish, too tired to toil.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;I am a gentleman of non-occupation, idling comfortably through a busy world.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;I&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221;&#8212;and here he glanced down at his own little Jack in the stern of the old boat&#8212;&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;I am a tiny child, with an unknown life all before me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear friends, such are some of your answers to my question. Can I find, do you think, one answer, one description, which will suit you all&#8212;fisherman, mothers, boys and girls, artists, merchants, gentlemen, the old man and the little child? Yes, I can. If I could hand you each a piece of paper and a pencil this day, there is one description of yourself which would include you all, the old, the young, the rich and the poor. Each of you, without exception, might write this&#8212;<i>I am a servant.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;I, the speaker, am a servant; you who listen, all of you, are servants.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know how he is going to make that out,&#8221; I said to myself. &#8220;I thought he was going to say we were all sinners, and <i>that</i>, I suppose we are, but <i>servants</i>! I do not believe I am anybody&#8217;s servant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All servants,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;but not all in the same service. As God and the angels look down upon this green today they see gathering together a great company of servants; but they also see that we are not all servants of the same master. They see what we do not see, a dividing line between us. On one side of the line God sees, and the angels see, one company of servants&#8212;and in God&#8217;s book He gives us the name of their master&#8212;<i>Servants of Sin.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;On the other side of the line, God sees, and the angels see, another company of servants&#8212;<i>Servants of Christ.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Which company do you belong to, dear friend? You fishermen on the bank there, what are you? Little child, what are you?&#8212;a servant of sin, or a servant of Jesus Christ?</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you say, &#8216;How can I tell? How can I possibly know on which side of the line I stand? God may know, the angels may know, but how can I know, myself?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is no difficult thing to discover; it is as plain and clear as possible. A servant of sin obeys his master. Sin rules in him. He pleases his own sinful heart. &#8216;What should I like?&#8217; is the rule by which he is governed. He wakes in the morning, and he asks himself this question, &#8216;What do I wish to do today?&#8217; And if the sin in his heart prompts him to do anything contrary to God&#8217;s will, he does it without scruple. Sin rules; he is a servant of sin.</p>

<p>&#8220;A servant of Christ obeys <i>his</i> master. Christ rules in him. He pleases Christ. &#8216;What would Christ have me do?&#8217; is the rule by which he is governed. He wakes in the morning, and the question he asks is this, &#8216;Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?&#8217; And if his Master bids him do anything contrary to his own inclinations, he does it readily, nay, cheerfully. Christ rules; he is a servant of Christ.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he ended by a very solemn appeal. &#8220;You must be one or other,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Oh, my friend, which are you?&#8212;a servant of sin, or a servant of Christ? Who is your master? On which side of the line do you stand?&#8221;</p>

<h1>Home of the Soul</h1>

<p>It is the cherished desire of every child of God to find a place of fellowship&#8212;a spiritual home where rest can be obtained, where the weary soul can relax and find unfailing comfort, guidance, and food. A place down here where he can feel good about things. A place where he can place his confidence and believe that things are fundamentally sound and worthy of confidence.</p>

<p>A child of God who has not found such a place lives with a constant hunger. He knows that down here is no continuing city; that here he is a pilgrim and stranger; but he longs to be in the company of other pilgrims and strangers as he travels toward his long home.</p>

<p>God only knows how many of His trusting children have had to make the journey all alone to the place of the gathering of all of the saints of all ages. And heaven will surely be worth it all. If one must travel alone to make it to heaven, it will be worth it.</p>

<p>This desire for human fellowship in the Lord down here in this present world is one of the things that exposes us to our adversary. He understands the hunger of humans for humans and takes advantage of the fact. He devises enticements with the design of entangling us in things that will hurt us spiritually. If we are hurt by some of these traps and withdraw from all attempts to walk in fellowship with others, then we find that we are hurt by the withdrawal, as well.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek after them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+34%3A6" title="Ezekiel 34:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ezekiel 34:6)</span></a></span>
It is a terrible experience to have your faith shattered in others&#8212;to realize that people are not what they professed to be&#8212;that the place where you were taught and thought you were blessed is really poisoned and false&#8212;that you did not perceive the &#8220;poison in the pot&#8221; for some time. But now that you escaped, it is only too evident that it was there all the time, and that others are suffering, but do not realize&#8212;cannot realize&#8212;the awful horror from which you have fled. It is a real shock to realize that the love of other people that you believed in and counted on was an illusion in many cases and only extended to you as long as you were in a certain group. As soon as you felt obligated to leave, it was and is as if you do not matter any more. &#8220;Yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek after them.&#8221;</p>

<p>God puts His little children through a refiner&#8217;s fire. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Malachi+3%3A3-4" title="Malachi 3:3-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Malachi 3:3-4)</span></a></span> He who knows all things, who never makes a mistake, sees fit to bring His little ones through great tribulation. He knows how to establish that you love Him above all else.</p>

<p>In John 9 we read the story of the man who was blind from his birth. Jesus healed him of his blindness, and this wonderful miracle plunged this dear man and his parents into an awful trial. His parents failed to love and esteem God above all else <span class="scripture">&#8220;because they feared the Jews.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+9%3A22" title="John 9:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 9:22)</span></a></span> They kept fellowship with the members of the synagogue, but lost Jesus. The blind man, however, kept clinging to what light and truth he had received. He would not deny it. <span class="scripture">&#8220;One thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+9%3A25" title="John 9:25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 9:25)</span></a></span> He would not give up what he knew was right if spite of all pressure brought to bear on him. Finally, in the eyes of many, including his parents, disaster overtook him. The &#8220;people of God,&#8221; descendants of Abraham, adherents of the one true faith, rejected him and his healing utterly. <span class="scripture">&#8220;They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+9%3A34" title="John 9:34"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 9:34)</span></a></span> His trueness to God cost him this. But the story has a happy ending. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and&#8230;&#8203;he&#8230;&#8203;found him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+9%3A35" title="John 9:35"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 9:35)</span></a></span> Jesus knew what this wonderful healing benefit would cost this man if he stayed true to light and understanding, and Jesus knew the test was necessary. Yea, <span class="scripture">&#8220;When my father and my mother forsake me, then the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> will take me up.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+27%3A10" title="Psalm 27:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 27:10)</span></a></span></p>

<p>God knows how to regenerate the human heart so completely that a timid, backward little child of His will keep clinging to Him in spite of all force brought against it. In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+5%3A18-19">Mark 5:18-19</a>, we read of a man who had been delivered from a legion of devils. This newly-saved man begged Jesus to be allowed to accompany Him. But so confident was the Lord of the strength of the experience of salvation that He had wrought in the heart of this brand-new child of God, that the Lord sent him back to where he had gotten in such trouble before to be a testimony to them: &#8220;And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him. Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.&#8221; Nor was this mission in vain, for when Jesus returned to this area later, the people received Him gladly (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+8%3A37-40">Luke 8:37-40</a>).</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>I was raised in a home which was shaped by the decision of my parents to leave a certain church and take a stand for another. This was an extremely difficult step for them. My folks did not attempt to prejudice any of us children toward a certain church or belief, as they reasoned that since they had been raised a certain way, and that way had proven false, then they wanted to leave us children open to decide from the beginning. They meant well by this, but it is not an entirely safe path, either. We can be too loyal to a group of people or not loyal enough. Either way will get us into trouble. Either way leaves out the most important thing of all. What does it mean to be faithful to God?</p>

<p>In the Bible we read, <span class="scripture">&#8220;If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1%3A6" title="I&nbsp;John 1:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 1:6)</span></a></span> You will note that it is possible to have fellowship with God. Nothing is as important as this relationship of fellowship with God. It is not possible to have fellowship with God while we walk in darkness. How many professed Christians are in this condition&#8212;living sinful lives while professing to walk with God. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Can two walk together, except they be agreed?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Amos+3%3A3" title="Amos 3:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Amos 3:3)</span></a></span> It is possible for God to change a person so that they no longer walk in darkness. Then God and that person can have fellowship. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1%3A3" title="I&nbsp;John 1:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 1:3)</span></a></span></p>

<p>If our relationship with God is not according to the Biblical standard of purity and uprightness, then our relationships with our fellow man will be less than they could be, as well. For the one stems from the other. If you get things right with God, then it will cause you to straighten out things with your fellow man, as well. Consider these words, <span class="scripture">&#8220;If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+4%3A20" title="I&nbsp;John 4:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 4:20)</span></a></span> The same divine work wrought in the heart by the power of God that causes us to repent and forsake all to love God also causes us to love our fellow man. Salvation in the heart of a person will reveal itself by its fruits. <span class="scripture">&#8220;But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1%3A7" title="I&nbsp;John 1:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 1:7)</span></a></span></p>

<p>This heavenly fellowship of a soul with its Maker is intended to be the same fellowship experienced of the redeemed toward each other. It is a natural and marvelous fellowship that starts in the heart the very instant that an individual is transformed by the power of God from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of His dear Son (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Col.+1%3A13">Col. 1:13</a>). We are raised above the best of friendships and kin relationships of our flesh to sit together in a higher, heavenly relationship with all the redeemed, both currently living and those who have finished their course and now rest from their labors (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+2%3A6">Ephesians 2:6</a>). This heavenly relationship supersedes the love of husband and wife or parents and children. It is the highest fellowship that man may know down here. First, fellowship with God, and the attendant fellowship with all the redeemed. It is based on a loyalty toward God and truth above all else, and rejoices above all at our great privilege, by the help of the Almighty, to walk in the light as He is in the light.</p>

<p>The basic principle, then, is the effort of the soul to keep fellowship with God and to value fellowship with God above all, no matter what all others may say or do. In the artificial world of allegiances to different man-made churches and man-controlled churches, this principle is entirely lost, for a great error has replaced it. There it is advocated that one must maintain their relationship with others in the group to keep fellowship with God. As to the results that follow this way of living, Jesus tells us, <span class="scripture">&#8220;For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+12%3A43" title="John 12:43"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 12:43)</span></a></span> And He said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+5%3A44" title="John 5:44"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 5:44)</span></a></span> These folks had their own standards of honoring, accepting, and rejecting. They had sought not the honor that came from God only. That is, salvation is the only Biblical standard for accepting each other, and a lack of salvation is the only Biblical standard for rejecting each other.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>My wife and I were part of a group of people who had considerable light on the Bible. For many years, there were people who lived to that light and taught it in different congregations scattered about the country. They were the remnants of an even larger group of people who used to be scattered all over the world. Many years ago, the leaders and others of that larger group began to forsake what they thought were minor standards of scriptural conduct. God was faithful to them, and different of His ministers and children suffered at their hands as part of that faithfulness, but they clung to their innovations until their anointing and fruitfulness gradually faded away, and they were left to their own devices. They are still going on today, worldly and bigoted, proud and important in their own eyes.</p>

<p>There were men and women who fled the letting down and outright compromise. They began to find each other, and they valued and esteemed salvation above any other consideration. There were others among them who did not, but the spiritual outlook prevailed and was held in esteem above all other ways of thinking. The question was, &#8220;Were you really saved and living for God with all your heart?&#8221; If this was perceived to be true, they welcomed you with open arms, extending to you the right hand of fellowship (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+2%3A9">Galatians 2:9</a>).</p>

<p>For a good number of years, this escaped remnant were very humble. They walked in the light that God shone on their pathway, and He helped them. Then they began to change. They left off the faithful dealings with each other according to Biblical truth, and began to let things slide.</p>

<p>I watched a group of these ministers sin together once. It was shocking. I had never thought they would do anything like what they did. They knew better. An individual had arisen among them who was teaching and practicing things that were plainly not Biblical. Furthermore, these ministers were aware that historically these teachings and practices had destroyed spiritual movements. I expected them to be faithful to God and right. But they were not. To be true to God under the circumstances meant that the group of people would possibly be split. Such was the influence of the individual preacher who was wrong. The ministry of that group of people denied God, their spiritual heritage, and the Bible itself, to hold the group together. That was twenty years ago. There has been no repentance among the ministry of that step. The effects of such sin are very apparent among them today.</p>

<p>There were a few who were not in agreement with the sin that was committed. Some spoke out against it. But the majority prevailed. I realized that I was not in a place where the truth and the Word of God were esteemed above anything else. I was unequally yoked (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Cor.+6%3A14-18">II&nbsp;Cor. 6:14-18</a>). Eventually, the Lord helped me to escape this group of people.</p>

<p>One of the characteristics of this people back when they were more spiritual was a closeness that appeared right away in a deep and loving concern about your burdens and needs. It was unfeigned and proved out over time. Well do we remember their sincerity and simplicity. If these brethren felt you were making a mistake, they prayed a lot and waited on God. If they felt the Lord moving them to talk with you, they were faithful to your soul. How I miss these dear ones! They have all finished their courses and gone on to their reward.</p>

<p>As I have said previously, these spiritual men and women were predominant among this group of people, and their burden and standard was blessed of God. There was real deliverance among them. God used them. He was in control of them, and it was a precious place to be.</p>

<p>I remember a time when I was talking with one of these brethren. I appreciated him so much, and was starting to get my eyes on him instead of God. I told him, &#8220;Brother C&#8212;, if you ever see anything in my life that you feel needs correction, please tell me.&#8221; I shudder now at how unguarded I was, and how much trouble I could have gotten into with some people in speaking this way. A lot of people would have taken advantage of my youth and inexperience to load me up with a lot of stuff. But I was talking to a true child of God. I will never forget how he looked at me&#8212;a combination of love and pity. &#8220;Bless your heart, Brother M&#8212;&#8221;, he replied, &#8220;I think, if I see something, I&#8217;ll go and tell Jesus, and let Him tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is a great deal of spiritual courtesy and respect in this attitude. I am reminded of the scripture in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+3%3A20">Revelation 3:20</a>, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Behold, I stand at the door, and knock.&#8221;</span> Jesus has a right to come in without knocking, but He extends to you the courtesy; He allows you to decide and choose. <span class="scripture">&#8220;If any man hear my voice, and open the door&#8230;.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+3%3A20" title="Revelation 3:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 3:20)</span></a></span></p>

<p>There is nothing overbearing about the Lord. He could easily overawe us and overwhelm us, until we would be compelled to go the direction that He desires, but He does not want it to be like that. God values voluntary service. Therefore, the Creator of the universe knocks and waits at the door of the human heart.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>This is a beautiful picture, scripturally correct and very real in the dealings of God with His children and those who are dead in trespasses and sins, but it is easily misunderstood. Why? If you have a heart to pursue the world and the flesh, the forbearance and courtesy of God will appear to you as license to live carelessly and negligently. On the other hand, if you are inclined to be very strict, precise, and exacting, then you will not value this respectfulness of God for the right to choose. You will long for Him to thunder at the door if such a way as to intimidate the inhabitant, and you will glory in the steel beneath the velvet, so to speak.</p>

<p>God is both. He is a God of unimaginably exacting judgement and a God of unimaginable mercy and love. He cannot be taught and passed on as a philosophy or concept, for His character is not captured by human reasoning. He is beyond us in the mind; He must be experienced in the heart.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+3%3A17-19" title="Ephesians 3:17-19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 3:17-19)</span></a></span>
Please note that this inner comprehension <span class="scripture">&#8220;passeth knowledge.&#8221;</span> In the New Testament, we have reached that precious time when all the saved shall know the Lord, from the least to the greatest, in this heart way that makes all outward exhortation unnecessary&#8212;which had been necessary in the Old Testament (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+8%3A11">Hebrews 8:11</a>).</p>

<p>It is this inner awareness of the simplicity and the complexity of knowing God that is so characteristic of any individual or congregation of individuals who hold the truth in righteousness. Any attempt to teach or hold even Bible truths before people without this inner conviction (of the necessity of each one knowing Christ for himself) will result in error. Even if the doctrine is right. Even if much good is done. Even if the intention is good.</p>

<p>A regenerated heart that walks in the light of heaven will be led into a great carefulness of life by the Holy Spirit. That carefulness will be inseparable from a growing and exceedingly precious love for God. It is as when a man and woman become husband and wife, and they began to learn to please each other as they start out in life. The individual services and sacrifices for each other are valuable, not in themselves, but as expressions of given and received love for each other. They are the fruits of love. The same actions, without the love, will become something else entirely. The wife observes that her husband loves biscuits for breakfast. He does not compel her to serve him biscuits. He would still get the favorite dish if he compelled her, but then the emphasis would be on the getting rather than that she voluntarily prepares them because she knows that he loves them. Thus the biscuits are a manifestation of her love for him, and he receives them and values them as the means of conveying love.</p>

<p>There is a humility in this that is very precious indeed. There is an exaltation of love above all works. There is a valuing of works for the love&#8217;s sake.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;We gaze in silent awe
<br />Upon the new creation,
<br />Where love is freedom&#8217;s law!&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Love_Is_Freedoms_Law/index.html" title="Love Is Freedom's Law">*</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Love is freedom&#8217;s law&#8221; is the very essence of a place of true fellowship down here for God&#8217;s children. And with this, a number of attitudes are absolutely necessary to do the work of God.</p>

<p>First, I must acknowledge that I cannot help people as they really need to be helped in order for them to serve God in the only way that is acceptable to Him. To begin with, the church cannot save them. There must be much, much more than just holy influence. The best preaching, personal service, counseling, etc., are not nearly enough. If people do not fall in love with Jesus and have a work done in them by Him that purifies the heart, then nothing is adequate. People cannot know the Lord just through our efforts. We must acknowledge the real limits of what we can do for Jesus when it comes to them being born again.</p>

<p>Secondly, I must acknowledge that I cannot nurture and assist the regenerated soul as the saved man or woman really needs, because they need more than the best I can give them. Only if I am used of God will they get some assistance through the foolishness of preaching. This is very humbling, but it is a true and accurate picture.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+2%3A1-2" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 2:1-2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 2:1-2)</span></a></span>
This learned and capable man laid aside all excellency of speech and human wisdom, because he knew, from experience, that the only way to know God is through the power of the cross in the heart. <span class="scripture">&#8220;That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+2%3A5" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 2:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 2:5)</span></a></span></p>

<p>To sit under a ministry like this is to be constantly stirred in your relationship to God. It will not exalt an organization or group of people, nor a minister or ministers, but it will amplify and exalt the Lord Jesus and His works in your heart and the hearts of others.</p>

<h1>The Facts About Fiction</h1>

<p>The idea that anything having to do with fiction is wrong is a fiction in and of itself, for you may as well advocate that the ability of mankind to imagine is inherently evil. The Bible does not teach us to abandon our ability to imagine (fictional thinking), but it does teach us to cast down every imagination that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and to bring every thought into obedience to Christ (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+10%3A5">II&nbsp;Corinthians 10:5</a>). It is not wrong to imagine, but it is necessary that every mental conception be submissive to truth and fact.</p>

<p>A little child of our acquaintance was raised by her parents to avoid any attempt to symbolize anything, as this was deemed detrimental. My daughter was reading her a poem which personified the wind and the book contained an illustration of the wind as a face in the clouds with lips pursed, huffing and puffing. To this illustration and the words of the poem, this child protested, objecting to the characterization, stating that the wind was not like that. She had been carefully schooled to think literally, and the subtleties of symbolic thought were completely out of her reach. Her parents were raising her to think in a way that they deemed advantageous, but they were actually stunting and harming a precious God-given ability, instead of guiding her to use her ability to imagine in a proper way. <b>The Bible employs symbolic and allegorical thought.</b> It is full of figurative and abstract thought. If we deny this, we must expect Herod to actually look like a fox (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+13%3A13">Luke 13:13</a>) or believers to literally resemble the branches of a vine (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+15%3A5">John 15:5</a>), to state just an extremely small sample of Bible examples of this kind.</p>

<p>The Bible incorporates our ability to think imaginatively in a number of ways. Consider an example of fictional thinking in the scriptures: the story of the trees as related in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Judges+9%3A8-15">Judges 9:8-15</a>. This story is a good example of <i>illustrative fiction</i>. It obviously neither was nor could be <i>literally</i> true, but it illustrated truth and was used of the Lord to deal with the hearts of the men of Shechem. They got the point, but rejected the illustrated truth thus portrayed and continued on in their wicked way until judgment overtook them.</p>

<p>We do not know that all the parables of Jesus were definite events that took place. For example, did a certain man actually find a pearl of great price in a certain plot of ground, or was the story an illustration of what would be likely to happen if you discovered something of great value on a certain property? As you can see, <i>the value of the parable is in <b>illustrating</b> a wonderful truth</i>, namely the desirability of being willing to sell all that you have to obtain a found thing of even greater value. The meaning of the parable is not a literal pearl in a certain literal field, but the great privilege of finding God&#8217;s great salvation and following through on your discovery by being willing to sell all that you have to possess the same. Whether the story actually occurred literally is immaterial, for the point is illustrative of something other than an actual pearl. It is figurative and allegorical. You might say that you have to think symbolically to get the value of the story. You have to use your imagination in the way God created it to be used.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of imaginative thinking (fiction) which circulates among mankind which is neither obedient to Christ nor beneficial to sound character. A certain minister was approached by a man who was hindered greatly in his faith. He asked the minister why he was so hindered. The minister visited him in his home and noticed his library, which was filled with all the examples of &#8220;good&#8221; fiction which he had been able to collect. He loved his collection and spoke of it with pride, but it was a great hindrance to him. The minister told him that his collection of fiction was the reason he could not have faith. <b>His collection did not illustrate truth, but illustrated the human reach of thought not under obedience to Christ.</b> No doubt, it was the best of human fictional imagining, but, lo, <span class="scripture">&#8220;man at his best state is altogether vanity.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+39%3A5" title="Psalm 39:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 39:5)</span></a></span> A story, poorly written, which illustrates eternal truth is superior to a story, well written, which does not.</p>

<p>Most science fiction is godless. The writers envisage a future without any form of godliness. Character is largely ignored. But here is an example that is entirely different.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Let me tell you a story. It is only a story of my own imagination, but it may give you a serious thought. Suppose the planet Mars is inhabited by people of like nature to us. They have moving pictures there as men have here. One theatrical man hears of the life of Jesus. He hears of it being the most wonderful life ever lived. He wishes to get that life on his films that he may play it out in his picture house. But he is told that the life of Jesus is a Spirit life, and he has no camera that will photograph a spirit. But he is also told that there is a people on the planet Earth who live the life of Jesus in the flesh, and if he will send his photographer to Earth and take a picture of the daily life of these people, he will have the life of Jesus.</p>

<p>Now we wish to ask you if you are ready to sit for the picture? Suppose you can&#8217;t get your automobile started, or the bread burns, or the clothesline breaks, or the baby is cross, or someone tells a falsehood on you, are you ready to have your picture taken and write under it, &#8220;Christlike&#8221;?</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[Orr, Charles E.; <i>Heavenly Life for Earthly Living</i>]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>As we said before, most science fiction is godless. But it does not have to be. It could be written entirely differently than it is. Of course the focus then would not be science; it would be holiness. What God has permitted man to realize about the world in which he lives. How to best utilize that understanding. What happens if we do not utilize that understanding correctly. How it is all a means to an end. How all these things will be destroyed and burnt up. The fictional capacity that we have is not wrong, but it certainly can be abused and misused.</p>

<p>In concluding, let me quote from <i>The Jerusalem Sinner Saved</i>, a sermon by John Bunyan:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">I will tell you a story that I have read of Martha and Mary; the name of the book I have forgot; I mean of the book in which I found the story; but the thing was thus:</p>

<p>Martha, saith my author, was a very holy woman, much like Lazarus, her brother; but Mary was a loose and wanton creature; Martha did seldom miss good sermons and lectures, when she could come at them in Jerusalem; but Mary would frequent the house of sports, and the company of the vilest of men for lust. And though Martha had often desired that her sister would go with her to hear her preachers, yea, had often entreated her with tears to do it, yet could she never prevail; for still Mary would make her excuse, or reject her with disdain, for her zeal and preciseness in religion.</p>

<p>After Martha had waited long, tried many ways to bring her sister to good, and all proved ineffectual, at last she comes upon her thus: &#8220;Sister,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;I pray thee go with me to the temple today, to hear one preach a sermon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of preacher is he?&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>Martha replied, &#8220;It is one Jesus of Nazareth; he is the handsomest man that ever you saw with your eyes. Oh! he shines in beauty, and is a most excellent preacher.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, what does Mary, after a little pause, but goes up into her chamber, and, with her pins and her clouts, decks up herself as fine as her fingers could make her. This done, away she goes, not with her sister Martha, but as much unobserved as she could, to the sermon, or rather to see the preacher.</p>

<p>The hour and preacher being come, and she having observed whereabout the preacher would stand, goes and sets herself so in the temple, that she might be sure to have the full view of this excellent person. So he comes in, and she looks, and the first glimpse of his person pleased her. Well, Jesus addresseth himself to His sermon, and she looks earnestly on Him.</p>

<p>Now, at that time, saith my author, Jesus preached about the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the prodigal child. And when He came to show what care the shepherd took for one lost sheep, and how the woman swept to find her piece which was lost, and what joy there was at their finding, she began to be taken by the ears, and forgot what she came about, musing what the preacher would make of it. But when He came to the application, and showed, that by the lost sheep, was meant a great sinner; by the shepherd&#8217;s care, was meant God&#8217;s love for great sinners; and that by the joy of the neighbors, was showed what joy there was among the angels in heaven over one great sinner that repenteth: she began to be taken by the heart. And as He spake these last words, she thought He turned His innocent eyes just upon her, and looked as if He spake what was now said to her: wherefore her heart began to tremble, being shaken with affection and fear; then her eyes ran down with tears apace; wherefore she was forced to hide her face with her handkerchief, and so sat sobbing and crying all the rest of the sermon.</p>

<p>Sermon being done, up she gets, and away she goes, and withal inquired where this Jesus the preacher dined that day? And one told her, &#8220;At the house of Simon the Pharisee.&#8221; So away goes she, first to her chamber, and there strips herself of her wanton attire; then falls upon her knees to ask God forgiveness for all her wicked life. This done, in a modest dress she goes to Simon&#8217;s house, where she finds Jesus sat at dinner. So she gets behind Him, and weeps, and drops her tears upon His feet like rain, and washes them, and wipes them with the hair of her head. She also kissed His feet with her lips, and anointed them with ointment.</p>

<p>When Simon the Pharisee perceived what the woman did, and being ignorant of what it was to be forgiven much (for he never was forgiven more than fifty pence), he began to think within himself, that he had been mistaken about Jesus Christ, because He suffered such a sinner as this woman was, to touch Him. Surely, quoth he, this man, if He were a prophet, would not let this woman come near Him, for she is a townsinner; so ignorant are all selfrighteous men of the way of Christ with sinners.</p>

<p>But, lest Mary should be discouraged with some clownish carriage of this Pharisee, and so desert her good beginnings, and her new steps which she now had begun to take towards eternal life, Jesus began thus with Simon: &#8220;Simon,&#8221; saith He, &#8220;I have somewhat to say unto thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he saith, &#8220;Master, say on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was,&#8221; said Jesus, &#8220;a certain creditor which had two debtors; the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me, therefore, which of them will love him most?&#8221;</p>

<p>Simon answered, and said, &#8220;I suppose that he to whom he forgave most.&#8221;</p>

<p>And He said unto him, &#8220;Thou hast rightly judged.&#8221; And He turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, &#8220;Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet; but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. Thou gavest me no kiss; but this woman, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet. My head with oil thou didst not anoint, but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment. Wherefore, I say unto her, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. And He said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.&#8221; [<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+7%3A36-48">Luke 7:36-48</a>].</p>

<p>Thus you have the story. If I come short in any circumstance, I beg pardon of those that can correct me. It is three or four and twenty years since I saw the book; yet I have, as far as my memory will admit, given you the relation of the matter. However, Luke, as you see, doth here present you with the substance of the whole.</p>

<p>Following is a note about this story by the editor of Bunyan&#8217;s writing in <i>The Whole Works of John Bunyan</i>, by George Offor:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">I cannot discover in what book Bunyan read this legend; it is not in the <i>Golden Legend</i>, or any of my monkish authors. It was a generally received opinion, among the ancients, that Mary Magdalene was sister to Lazarus; but the means of her conversion is not known. The story here related is possible, and even probable; but it has no foundation in the inspired writings, nor in ancient authors.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+4%3A8" title="Philippians 4:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 4:8)</span></a></span></p>

<p>If an imagined story is plainly identified as an imagined story and it is according to truth, then it is not misrepresentation (untruth), but a true-to-life story. This is how Bunyan used the story of Mary Magdalene to illustrate truth in the sermon he preached. He identified the narrative as <i>just a story</i> and made no other claim for it. The story cannot be proved to be factual, nor can it be disproved, but it does set forth and illustrate things that are true. The fictional story is honest, just, pure, lovely, of good report, full of virtue and worthy of praise.</p>

<p>Such fiction is in total agreement with truth and illustrates the same in a very useful and helpful way. It is in obedience to Christ and is edifying and beneficial.</p>

<h1>An Experience with Brother Effinger</h1>

<p>When I was a young minister of about sixteen years of age, I attended the national campmeeting of the Church of God at Monark, MO; and there I met Brother Effinger. He was an elderly man from Alabama, and I was told that he had spent most of his lifetime as a minister of the First Church of God. After all his years in that place, he became persuaded that those people had compromised the truth they once had and that God was calling for a separation from everything that was not of Him. So he left his position as a salaried minister and departed from them, in obedience to the Word of God, and started all over, in spite of his advanced years, among a people who knew him not. As Abraham, he left his familiar acquaintance and kin, and was led to a place that he knew not. Only God and Brother Effinger knew how much that step cost him.</p>

<p>Brother Effinger had spent a long time in sectism; and although he had left the man-made religion where he had been, he retained many of the mannerisms that prevailed among a people who were not led by the Spirit of God. His speech and demeanor were suggestive of those who habitually knew and used the ways of political expediency, and those ways were repugnant to me as a young minister. Possibly others were affected the same way among the people where we both worshiped; I do not know. There were those who knew him and esteemed him, but at that point, I had not heard their sentiments expressed.</p>

<p>A brother in the Lord told me a little of his history, and it sounded impressive and worthy of respect, but his outward mannerisms so plainly portrayed Babylon to me, that I found it hard to really feel that he had much. It seemed that he had gotten out of sectism, but sectism had not gotten out of him. In short, it was quite difficult for me to regard him as a brother, saved and sanctified, and walking in the light of God.</p>

<p>There was no attempt to prop up this brother&#8217;s ministry. Among that people, at that time, brothers and sisters in the Lord trusted God with the government of the people. They believed that the Lord would either make room or not for others, and they were content for Him to do it. I was accepted among them because my spirit blended with theirs, and all others were accepted or not on the same basis. Brother Effinger was accepted on the same basis.</p>

<p>This trust was not in vain, for God is quite sufficient to convince us of what we need to be convinced of. He knows just how to do it. This was exactly where the saints put their trust, and it proved out again, for this story is the story of how God dealt with me about Brother Effinger. There are a multitude of these accounts among any people who trust God fully, and who know not to lean to their own understanding and practice the same. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Except the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> build the house, they labour in vain that build it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+127%3A1" title="Psalm 127:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 127:1)</span></a></span></p>

<p>At this meeting, it was my habit (as it was with many others) to retire to a place of prayer between each service to petition the Lord to help us, to defend us from our adversary&#8217;s attempts to mar the efforts made for God and for the good of souls, and to bless the Word of God to be preached with power, authority, and anointing. There were usually greater numbers of people present on the weekends, and therefore even more responsibility, so special fervency would attend our prayers for these services. No effort was made to control the pulpit beyond looking to God&#8212;there was no schedule or program to follow, and this way of doing things was deliberate&#8212;a conscious decision and stand to trust God to help us. This responsibility was keenly felt individually. No one advised me or pushed me to pray in this way, nor was there an effort to coerce anyone into doing so. It was simply left to those who were burdened. If no one was burdened, no one would do it.</p>

<p>On the first Sunday afternoon service of the meeting, after a time of waiting on the Lord, before a large crowd, Brother Effinger arose and walked to the pulpit. I was horrified. He began to preach as he always did, in a rather high-pitched older man&#8217;s voice which was very formal and trained. In deportment and mannerisms, he was an excellent sample of the product of a preacher factory (seminary)&#8212;at least, that is how it seemed to be, and I found it repugnant and was immensely disheartened. Brother Effinger continued to speak in this way for about fifteen minutes. I had settled down to endure the discourse.</p>

<p>He was preaching about the second coming of our Lord, and he read the scripture in the book of Revelations which states, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Behold, he cometh with clouds.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+1%3A7" title="Revelation 1:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 1:7)</span></a></span> He read this phrase, then he stopped. I do not know better how to describe it than to say that we, he&#8212;we all&#8212;seemed to come alive. I remember sitting up in my seat, my attention arrested and riveted on those words. Brother Effinger read them again. They seemed to just stand out. What this was, of course, was the anointing of the Holy Spirit. Then Brother Effinger shouted the words. He didn&#8217;t seem to make a willful or deliberate effort to shout them; it just welled up in his soul. It welled up in our souls, too. By &#8220;our,&#8221; I mean all who loved the Lord in that large congregation. It was as though we had all caught fire by spontaneous combustion, preacher and congregation alike. The message (in every possible fullness of meaning of the word) proceeded in a blaze of glory, and thus the Lord fed our souls.</p>

<p>That was the last of any prejudice about Brother Effinger. It was a precious and lasting lesson. God goes not by the outward appearance, but by the heart. Brother Effinger may have looked and talked like someone who had spent long years in Babylon, but he was as genuine and bona fide child of God from the heart as I have ever had the privilege of knowing.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked: That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+12%3A24-25" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 12:24-25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 12:24-25)</span></a></span></p>

<h2>Peace Child</h2>
<p>by Don Richardson, published by Regal Books</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">When I urged them to make peace, they replied, &#8220;Tuan, you just don&#8217;t understand!&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>


<p>This is a story of the struggle to communicate the gospel effectually to a culture that glorified treachery and violence, to whom Judas Iscariot was the hero, and Jesus the cleverly deceived victim of his treachery.</p>

<p>The author and his wife went in 1962 as missionaries to the Sawi, a tribe of head-hunting cannibals who idealized treachery so highly that an attempt to unite against common enemies (other cannibalistic tribes) failed because the opportunity to betray a friend presented itself. The author and his wife discovered that God had preserved a concept in their culture that opened the door to the gospel, the concept of the &#8220;peace child.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is not a book for everybody. There is a lot of graphic description of violence and things that are not edifying. We found that by reading as a family with a lot of selective omission of details, we were able to enjoy an exciting drama of the Lord&#8217;s power and resourcefulness in attacking the &#8220;gates of hell&#8221; in a culture long bound by the devil. Though we aren&#8217;t in agreement with a number of teachings held by the author, we were encouraged by examples of prayerful dependence on the Lord and the power of God working to change hearts and enable people to genuinely forgive their enemies, and by the thought that God has preserved in every culture some means of communicating the gospel effectually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">&#8220;So also if anyone tempts us to do evil, we should say to him, &#8216;Look here! God has placed the Spirit of His Peace Child, Jesus, within me. If that Peace Child had died or gone away and left me, I might be free to do the evil you suggest. But He is not dead! Nor has He deserted me! He still lives within me to keep me in the way of goodness, and His hand is strong! I am not free to do the evil you advise!&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<h1>&#8220;I Write unto You, Young Men&#8221;</h1>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first"><span class="scripture">&#8220;I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+2%3A14" title="I&nbsp;John 2:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 2:14)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it? It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth: But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+4%3A30-32" title="Mark 4:30-32"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 4:30-32)</span></a></span></p>

<p>The <span class="scripture">&#8220;kingdom of heaven&#8221;</span> at times describes the whole work of God, and at other times the work in an individual who is born again. This parable has meaning in both arenas, but our thoughts here are directed toward the individual: you, young man, and me. The mustard seed is very small, is it not? And not only very small, but it must be sown for there to be any prospects of change. If I&#8217;m a mustard seed, and aspire to be a useful bush, I face two challenges: my sense of inferiority to seeds in general, and the appalling prospect of being buried. But in these two things lie great promise, for if I recognize how disadvantaged I am, it stirs me all the more to call upon God and depend on Him to work. And if I face the prospect of being buried, and accept it, nothing stands in the way of God working. I had to die to what I was to get saved. I must stay buried (deny myself, stay lowly in heart) to grow.</p>

<p>Suppose now I have been born again by the will of God&#8212;I&#8217;m saved&#8212;all things are new&#8212;and I now look ahead and a vision of usefulness in the kingdom of God rises before me. But I&#8217;m so small, so limited, have so many weaknesses and faults! Ah, the mustard seed is <span class="scripture">&#8220;less than all the seeds that be in the earth.&#8221;</span> Last place&#8212;that is, behind everything and everyone else. How does it become this great bush with <span class="scripture">&#8220;great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it&#8221;</span>? Simply this: <span class="scripture">&#8220;it groweth up.&#8221;</span> Do you see a timetable here? Does it say, that it grows faster to catch up, or it focuses on the other bushes in any way? No. It simply grows. We want to follow this thought of growing, first examining a couple of examples in the Bible.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Kings+12%3A8" title="I&nbsp;Kings 12:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Kings 12:8)</span></a></span></p>

<p>This is spoken of Rehoboam, King Solomon&#8217;s son, at a point of crisis in his life. It was time to be crowned king of Israel, but there were simmerings of rebellion at the oppressive load Rehoboam&#8217;s father had put on the people. The full story shows the disastrous mistake he made (yes, it was according to God&#8217;s purpose, but from his perspective, it was an awful mistake, nonetheless). What went wrong? He <span class="scripture">&#8220;consulted with the young men that were grown up with him.&#8221;</span> We are often naturally attracted to those closer to our &#8220;level,&#8221; our peers, because we feel &#8220;normal-sized&#8221; around them. But Rehoboam so badly needed the counsel of those much further along than him in this crisis. Furthermore, the counsel of his &#8220;fellow seeds&#8221; was the sort to make him feel big and important. Oh, how deadly pride is to proper growth!</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Exodus+2%3A11" title="Exodus 2:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Exodus 2:11)</span></a></span></p>

<p>This is a test of where Moses was in his growing. Do you notice the phrase, &#8220;one of his brethren&#8221;? Moses identified with these lowly, despised slaves, despite all the earthly advantages he had lived under. He was headed in the right direction for proper growth, but we find he still had a way to go before being useful in God&#8217;s sight. His own idea of delivering &#8220;his brethren&#8221; was still full of himself and his abilities. Later, after forty years as a shepherd in the wilderness, he had gotten small enough:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Num.+12%3A3" title="Num. 12:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Num. 12:3)</span></a></span> This later Moses was the man God used to deliver His people.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+92%3A12" title="Psalm 92:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 92:12)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Palm trees, with their single trunk and cluster of large green branches, give a sense of luxuriant plant life&#8212;I still carry a picture in my mind of a row of stately palms lining a road we drove by when I was a young child, towering perhaps 50 feet in the air. Palm branches are used as a symbol of victory. The cedars of Lebanon were stately, long-branched, and the wood was of pleasant odor as well as durable. They were the giant trees of the middle east, much as those in the western US might regard the coastal or Sequoia redwood trees of California, or the Douglas Firs of the Northwest. These are images that suggest resiliency and stature. But let us consider the beginning of the verse: <span class="scripture">&#8220;The righteous.&#8221;</span> We don&#8217;t grow successfully to great stature spiritually because of wisdom or boldness or zeal (although these might play a part at times in our growth), but by being <span class="scripture">&#8220;the righteous.&#8221;</span> Living right, keeping clean in our souls, walking humbly in obedience to our Savior&#8212;these are the things that result in flourishing growth.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+2%3A2" title="I&nbsp;Peter 2:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 2:2)</span></a></span></p>

<p>A human baby grows best as it gets the nourishment best designed for it. The word <i>sincere</i> in this context means unmixed, or pure. A newborn babe doesn&#8217;t know enough to really have an appetite for anything other than <span class="scripture">&#8220;sincere milk,&#8221;</span> but they can develop an appetite for less healthy things if given them, and can learn to desire them more than the milk. A child of God can develop an appetite for less healthy things than <span class="scripture">&#8220;the word,&#8221;</span> but what is best for them? Spiritual growth can be stunted, or worse, by the many things the enemy of our souls would mix with <span class="scripture">&#8220;the word,&#8221;</span> or substitute for <span class="scripture">&#8220;the word.&#8221;</span> Let us plead with the Lord to help us have healthy appetites for the things that are best for us to grow spiritually!</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+3%3A18" title="II&nbsp;Peter 3:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 3:18)</span></a></span></p>

<p>I spent a little time as a volunteer &#8220;collector&#8221; of overdue accounts for a daycare some years ago. I also work now with people who have to collect money owed to a government agency. One of the things I noticed both in my own labors and in observing those of others, is how &#8220;grace&#8221; works in these situations. Grace is extended to the humble and cooperative, and not generally to the stubborn and &#8220;slippery.&#8221; This is partly due to the natural reactions of people who have the distasteful task of &#8220;going after&#8221; people to collect debts, but it also pertains to justice and fair play. It is more appropriate to reward cooperativeness than contrariness. There is a correspondence here with grace as it pertains to our relationship with the Lord. To <span class="scripture">&#8220;grow in grace&#8221;</span> is not to become more self-sufficient, but to cooperate more fully with a loving and generous God! To <span class="scripture">&#8220;grow in grace&#8221;</span> is to grow more proficient at responding humbly to God&#8217;s dealings with us, at leaning on Him and cooperating with Him and drawing our strength from Him! And to <span class="scripture">&#8220;grow&#8230;&#8203;in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ&#8221;</span> suggests something different than if it were put &#8220;grow in the knowledge of Jesus Christ.&#8221; The focus is on knowledge that pertains to His position with us as Lord and Savior. If we gain the type of knowledge that enhances our obedience, such as hearing His voice better and trusting Him more, we are growing in the knowledge of our Lord. If we gain more of a love for good and abhorrence for evil, and a dependence on Him to <span class="scripture">&#8220;deliver us from evil,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;q=deliver us from evil " title=""><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> ()</span></a></span> we are growing in the knowledge of our Savior.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;It groweth up&#8221;</span>&#8212;let&#8217;s ask the Lord to help us do so.</p>

<h1>Spiritual Composure</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>Does it seem at times that cares and troubles overshadow your life? There are so many tasks&#8212;doing everything you can to help nearly everybody you know, that you seem to drown in them? There are so many folks who are needy in their souls? There are those family differences in the religious sphere. There is the children&#8217;s schooling. There are financial needs. You have trouble even finding quiet time with the Lord. And the list goes on&#8230;&#8203;but let&#8217;s stop and rest awhile today. I want to share this subject of spiritual composure which the Lord has given me in the midst of all my battles and struggles.</p>

<p><i>Composure</i> is calmness and tranquillity; implying the disciplining of one&#8217;s emotions in trying situations or habitual self-possession in the face of excitement. Let&#8217;s see what the synonyms are: <i>Equanimity</i> implies an inherent evenness of temper or disposition that is not easily disturbed. <i>Serenity</i> implies a lofty, clear peace of mind that is not easily clouded by ordinary stresses or excitements.</p>

<p>Sounds wonderful doesn&#8217;t it? To many, I believe, it is just a dream, but the Lord does have this quality as part of our spiritual character. He not only has this gift for us, but He <i>longs</i> for us to have it. He wants us to trust Him.</p>

<p>Just recently I was disturbed about a situation. I couldn&#8217;t help it; the tears flowed. I was afraid for a certain individual. The decision appeared so full of risk. At the place of prayer, the thoughts that troubled the mind were poured out. &#8220;Lord, would You give us something from Your word to guide us in our thinking?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bible fell open to Matthew 24. The middle part of verse six, <span class="scripture">&#8220;See that ye be not troubled,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+24%3A6" title="Matthew 24:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 24:6)</span></a></span> was impressed upon our mind and heart. Here Jesus was talking, or rather even commanding, about not being troubled, saying, <span class="scripture">&#8220;<b>See</b> that ye be not troubled.&#8221;</span> Now war and rumors of wars are troubling. But Jesus has said, See that ye be not even troubled about that! My distress was quite small compared to wars.</p>

<p>Now I had asked the Lord to guide me in thinking about this issue. Here was the answer! How good God is to answer prayer. Now I didn&#8217;t have to worry about this any longer. Jesus Himself said to <span class="scripture">&#8220;see that ye be not troubled.&#8221;</span> How the Lord wants us to just simply trust Him. How often do we carry problems around and worry about things when Jesus wants to take care of them for us? How much more trust we need! The Lord was faithful, and the risky decision-in-the-making was dropped. Fellow Christians, <b>the Lord is able</b>! I believe we would get more answers to prayer if there were more trust in our hearts.</p>

<p>In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+24%3A38">Luke 24:38</a>, Jesus asked the believers, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?&#8221;</span> Jesus had just appeared while they were talking, after having just vanished earlier in another place. They were terrified and afraid, and supposed they had seen a ghost, as we would put it today. But Jesus said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Why are ye troubled?&#8221;</span> Was there anything to fear? Of course, we can see today that there wasn&#8217;t. But it didn&#8217;t seem that way to them. Isn&#8217;t that the case with many of our fears today? Looking at it from Jesus&#8217; heavenly perspective, these fears are needless.</p>

<p>When the women came to the tomb and found Jesus gone they were perplexed and afraid. The two shining angels were there to speak peace and calmness to them. Note what they said: <span class="scripture">&#8220;He is not here, but is risen: <b>remember</b> how he spake unto you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+24%3A6" title="Luke 24:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 24:6)</span></a></span>
We need to be reminded of God&#8217;s continual care and protection. Remember God is caring for you&#8212;even in the face of adversity.</p>

<p>Jesus&#8217; own words to us is <span class="scripture">&#8220;Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+14%3A1" title="John 14:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 14:1)</span></a></span> If our hearts are troubled, are we not doubting God and His promises? Paul&#8217;s words were, <span class="scripture">&#8220;And we <b>know</b> that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A28" title="Romans 8:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 8:28)</span></a></span> He was convinced and he remembered and this brought great calmness and composure to his soul. Again, we find Paul <span class="scripture">&#8220;saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+20%3A23-24" title="Acts 20:23-24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 20:23-24)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Is it not pleasant to receive an invitation to dinner? After all the meals a mother makes, it is really special to set down to one you didn&#8217;t have to prepare! Did you know there is an invitation to rest and repose in the Word? <span class="scripture">&#8220;And to you who are troubled rest with us.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Thessalonians+1%3A7" title="II&nbsp;Thessalonians 1:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Thessalonians 1:7)</span></a></span> Are you refusing the invitation and stubbornly cling to your worry and cares? I wonder if this was the case in Paul&#8217;s time, as he continues his second letter to the Thessalonians. He is there beseeching or begging them to <span class="scripture">&#8220;be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Thessalonians+2%3A2" title="II&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:2)</span></a></span> In the third verse he goes on to say, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Thessalonians+2%3A3" title="II&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:3)</span></a></span> Now to see those we love growing cold spiritually, their vision being dimmed by some indulgence, does indeed make us sad. But we are still not to be troubled. Cast it on the Lord. This is too much for us to carry. We can still take their need to God in prayer, but we are not to be troubled.</p>

<p>May the inspired word of God be your portion and give you this wonderful gift of spiritual composure of heart. Who would not want it?</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil. And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? But and if ye suffer for righteousness&#8217; sake, happy are ye; and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled; But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always; to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A12-15" title="I&nbsp;Peter 3:12-15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 3:12-15)</span></a></span></p>

<h1>Things Don&#8217;t Just Happen</h1>

<p class="author">Author Unknown</p>

<p class="verse">Things don&#8217;t just happen to children of God,
<br />They&#8217;re part of a wonderful Plan,
<br />The troubles, reverses, the sorrows, the rod,
<br />Are strokes of the Great Sculptor&#8217;s Hand.</p>

<p class="verse">When some dread accident strikes you a blow,
<br />And you restlessly fret and demand
<br />Why try so hard the mystery to know?
<br />It&#8217;s not just an accident, it&#8217;s planned.</p>

<p class="verse">Have you been dropped from a place of power
<br />Do you wonder and reprimand?
<br />Don&#8217;t rebel, but look to Him in that hour,
<br />This didn&#8217;t just happen, it&#8217;s planned.</p>

<p class="verse">Persecution, tribulation, come down like a storm,
<br />Friends disappoint and withstand,
<br />At last, all alone, bewildered, forlorn,
<br />You look, and He smiles, This is planned.</p>

<p class="verse">Do you wonder why God to affliction should call,
<br />And why you must suffer and moan?
<br />&#8220;No man should be moved by affliction,&#8221; says Paul,
<br />For you know it is part of the plan.</p>

<p class="verse">Did some dear one sicken and finally die,
<br />Did your heart break with anguish and woe?
<br />Did you question your Lord and cry, &#8220;My God, why?&#8221;
<br />Don&#8217;t question. He planned it just so.</p>

<p class="verse">Things don&#8217;t just happen to children of God,
<br />The blueprint was made by His hand;
<br />He designed all details to conform to His Son,
<br />So all things that happen are planned.</p>

<p class="verse">No matter what happens to those called &#8220;His own,&#8221;
<br />Events that are awful or grand,
<br />Every trial of your life He sends from His Throne.

<h1>Are You Sacrificing Your Children?</h1>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> cast out from before the children of Israel.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Kings+16%3A3" title="II&nbsp;Kings 16:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Kings 16:3)</span></a></span></p>

<p>King Ahaz made his children go through fire. How about you? How are you living? Are you nourshing the needs of your children or are they suffering under the hand of selfish, pleasure-seeking parents?</p>

<p>The heathen actually killed their children. Satan deceived them into believing that the gods they served either demanded or were pleased with this. These little ones were innocent and were welcomed into the portals of heaven. Today, Satan has dreamed up a plan that will earn more souls for his hellish kingdom. He sends trouble to the home. The god of selfish pleasure demands. Thus, divorce is ravishing this generation of children. Then, not marrying at all, but just living with first one man than another, is sacrificing your children. Now we have many children living under one roof, often all having different last names. How sad. Have you ever thought of the fire they are going through?</p>

<p>This is not the innocent children&#8217;s fault, but they feel it somehow is, and blame themselves. There are tears on the pillow. Their little minds and bodies are troubled. They have stomach aches at school and can&#8217;t keep their minds on the studies. They keep praying Mom and Dad will get back together. Or worse yet, they don&#8217;t even know Dad. Insecurity is overwhelming. Childhood is not a normal, carefree, happy time.</p>

<p>Are you sacrificing your children? A father seeking divorce was asked to think about the grief he was causing his children. His comment, with a toss of the head was, &#8220;Oh, they will get over it.&#8221; That is only wishful thinking. A survey was once made of adults who had, as children, gone through their parents&#8217; divorce. Not even one adult reported as having gotten over it. But rather the contrary. It was indeed a fire they had gone through. Yes, they had been burned, hurt and damaged. These children were not sacrificed to a heathen god as infants and were now safe in the arms of Jesus. Oh, no, the devil wants them! Do you see the devil&#8217;s plan? How easy for him to now sow seeds of unbelief and hopelessness in these young, hurt, damaged hearts. He wants to bring this generation of children down to even a lower level of sin and evil. The devil is mean and strong. He is a very hard taskmaster, who only brings on more and more wretchedness. Do you want to continue serving him?</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t have to. If your life is in a mess, the best possible thing is to turn your life over to God. You don&#8217;t have to find the way alone. God is just waiting to help you. He is holding out His arms of mercy to you. He wants to guide and direct your life. He wants to dry the tears, heal the hurts, the scars and broken hearts. He wants to give you peace and happiness.</p>

<p>Young people, are you a product of having gone through the fire? Did I hear you say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do it like Mom did?&#8221; Thank the Lord, there is a way of escape. There is Someone who really, really, unselfishly loves you. He has given up every thing for you. He didn&#8217;t marry as the normal man while here on earth. He gave it all up for you. He has prayed for you that you might be saved. He is here to bind up the wounds. He is here to put His loving arms around you. He is much bigger, stronger and more powerful than the devil who has caused so much trouble in your life. He died on the cross and shed His blood that you can be washed from all evil that has been imposed or that you have committed.</p>

<p>I want to tell you of one who did escape their background; one who broke the cycle. He was a boy whose mother had divorced and remarried eight times or more. He lost count after while! He didn&#8217;t want that kind of life. He gave his life to God. God gave him a good wife who has not sought out a career for herself, but has stayed home to be a helpmeet to him and to train the children.</p>

<p>God has a way of escape for you! Choose God&#8217;s way and have a happy, fulfilled life while on earth and eternal safety after death.</p>

<p>This is your hope in breaking the cycle. Give your heart and life to God. He can help you have a happy, profitable life.</p>

<p>Marriage is not just something to try out&#8212;marriage is for life! God meant for divorce to be non-existent! From the beginning, it was not so.</p>

<p>To marry is not just for your own pleasure. You are to accept the responsibility for the childrens&#8217; well-being that are born in the family. Each child deserves a welcome. Even your thoughts as a mother affect your unborn child. You are building a fire for your baby if you harbor negative, sad thoughts about him. Are you looking at it as a trouble and added expense&#8212;as an intrusion into your planned life? Oh, ask God to forgive you. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Children are an heritage of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>&#8230;. Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+127%3A3%2C5" title="Psalm 127:3,5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 127:3,5)</span></a></span> This can also be your testimony if you will turn to God and take His guidance. We are praying for you.</p>

<p>As I was preparing the apples I had collected from my father&#8217;s place yesterday to be made into applesauce, I was reminded again of the great need for continued humility in our attitudes. I have received a most precious lesson from these apples that I <i>do not</i> want to forget.</p>

<p>Here in the Willamette Valley, the apples were able to pollinate most profusely, and apples are seen all over, just falling off the trees. Being aware that this is the year of plenty, I had purposed in my heart to take advantage of the opportunity and gather apples and make applesauce enough for several years, if possible, as our family seems to devour the savory delicacy, especially when other fresh fruit is not available.</p>

<p>Well, it happened that our family needed to spend three weeks in my father&#8217;s home to care for him while my sister&#8217;s family was away. During this time his yellow transparent apple tree was loaded with good, worm-free, organic apples. I had come to the conclusion years ago that these apples were not much good other than for eating fresh off the tree, as they didn&#8217;t seem to have much flavor and were also quite tart. I had mentioned this to my sister who was living there. So, we labored in clearing the fallen fruit from the ground as to keep the area clear from fermenting fruit and the gathering of insects. We first took them over to the goats in a nearby field, but in dumping the buckets there, we discovered that they were not interested, and realized that perhaps their appetites were satisfied by the many blackberries that were available to munch on. Next we took a couple buckets back to our home to throw out to the two sheep and the chickens that we had. In gathering buckets full and hauling to our location, we also discovered that perhaps the supply was overwhelming them as well, as they were being found rotting on the ground, so we started to dump the apples into our compost area.</p>

<p>I wondered about these apples, and how much work they had been, and all to a great waste&#8212;why was such a tree even allowed to grow! We faithfully labored in gathering and hauling each day until last week when my sister&#8217;s family returned, and we were able to return to our own home.</p>

<p>Well, yesterday was my day to care for my father. On arriving early my sister greeted me warmly and asked with great wonder why I had thought those apples were no good to put into sauce, as she had been gathering them each morning and made some of the best tasting applesauce around. Out the door her family went (with a large bowl of applesauce in her arms to share at a potluck they would be taking part in that day), with a &#8220;taste and see&#8221; on her lips as they departed. I went and found the sampling in her fridge that she had mentioned and really couldn&#8217;t wait to try it out. I took a spoonful and discovered that they were absolutely right. The sauce was so good that I took several spoonfuls and with much self-denial left the remainder of the bowl for their family to enjoy.</p>

<p>I truly had much to ponder on. To say the least, I was greatly humbled in my heart. I do indeed desire a walk of godly humility, and the Lord showed me that it is so easy to feel confident in any area of previous experience and that we need His Spirit to help us to be lowly in the estimation of our own understanding of things.</p>

<p>Thoughts also came to mind on how the principles in the Bible that indicate passiveness, plainness&#8212;true godliness, are not apparently attractive to the flesh. They do not appeal naturally to us in our humanity. We need also to &#8220;taste and see&#8221; what is truly there for each of us hidden in God&#8217;s promises for His children. Each one of us have been born with a willfulness of self and conditioned in so many ways to satisfy the lusts of the flesh. We are blind to these things, until we <i>allow</i> the Holy Spirit to deal with us <i>fully</i>.</p>

<p>I thank the Lord for being faithful to my soul and its needs. I want to prosper in my soul, but it takes a willingness to know that we are in continual need of the Lord to help us in order to make it to heaven.</p>

<p>I thank the Lord for this time to write down these thoughts. It is the beginning of the apple season and, Lord willing, I will have another opportunity to gather and put up applesauce. If not, I know that the lesson the Lord intended for me is infinitely more valuable.</p>

<h1>The Blessing God Asked Back</h1>

<p>I had often laughed off incredulous inquiries about where I slept, where in the world was my own space while living in a crowded school. But inside, I felt like I was going crazy. School had somehow taken over my entire mind and person. When I went to pray, there was no closet door to close (they had all been taken off the hinges to allow more room for classrooms) or door to shut and leave the world behind. It was a fighting battle to get my mind to rest from school enough to feed on the word of God. School, books, learning music surrounded my person, and penetrated my brain. Sometimes I would step outside to get a breather, but with early evening already dark in the winter, this became impossible. Even in the small town where I live, it is not safe for a young woman to wander about after dark.</p>

<p>I took the matter to the Lord in prayer. I had consecrated to live in a school, but it was getting beyond my ability to cope. I prayed about it for several months and one possibility after another fell through, and I felt more each day like I was headed for the insane asylum. Finally, after many months of prayer, a miraculous answer came to my doorstep. A lady who knew my situation offered me a rent-free place to live in a simple mobile home on a beautiful 2-1/2 acre piece of property. I was amazed and delighted at the way God had worked together an escape for me. I was blessed with the scripture, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Seek ye first the kingdom of God&#8230;&#8203;and all these things shall be added unto you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+6%3A33" title="Matthew 6:33"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 6:33)</span></a></span> Surely God had seen my faithfulness in teaching school and putting His work first in my life. What a blessing to be given such a wonderful gift of a lovely place in the country! At the moment, however, I did not have the time to move or even look at the place. I was totally occupied with some problems at school that were keeping my hands full to overflowing. I shelved the offer, as it was something that would keep.</p>

<p>The next week brought expected company to our part of the country and I was quite busy with being hostess, as they stayed at the school. The family that had arrived were looking for property and praying if it was God&#8217;s will for them to move to Oregon for fellowship. What they really needed was some place to stay, some place where they could move to while they looked for property. Rent is so expensive around here, that a regular rental was out of the question. They needed a miracle&#8212;a temporary rent-free home while they looked around. Rent-free? Was there something familiar about that term? My place, Lord? The retreat you worked out for me? Obviously, this family needed it much more than I did at the moment. After all, I did have a roof over my head. The sensible, reasonable, perfect-solution thing to do was to offer the place that I wasn&#8217;t even living in yet to this family.</p>

<p>I felt like I was being ripped apart inside. The place was my answer to prayer: God had worked this out for me! Surely God could work something else out for them. He was a big God. Two rent-free places were nothing to Him! Weeks went by, the family went back to their home several states away, having found nothing, but still feeling a desire to move. I was, I&#8217;m afraid, feeling very resentful of them. If they were not in the picture, I could have rejoiced that I now had a place so I could move away from school. As it was, all I could feel was selfishness. I was torn between that and the genuine need that I had. Didn&#8217;t anyone understand that I <i>needed</i> a place to live? That the place had been offered to <i>me</i>, and it was <i>my</i> answer to prayer? Have you ever tried to give a hungry dog a large piece of meat and then have taken it away from him after he has set his teeth in it? Well, that is the way I felt. Why, God? Why didn&#8217;t someone else get offered a piece of rent-free land for this family? Why are you choosing me? Why didn&#8217;t you just give it to them directly?</p>

<p>Quietly and softly the Lord spoke gently to me, &#8220;My child, will you give up your gift? It was given to you&#8212;will you give it to them?&#8221;</p>

<p>I wanted to scream, &#8220;<i>No</i>! A thousand times, <i>no</i>!&#8221; But right there as I reflected, my heart torn and screaming, the words of the song writer came to me, &#8220;Give, as &#8217;twas given to you in your need, Love as the Master loved you; Be to the helpless a helper indeed, Unto your mission be true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give, as &#8217;twas given to you in your need&#8221;&#8212;words I&#8217;d sung a thousand times hit me like a ton of steel.</p>

<p>Yes, I needed to give, the wonderful gift I had been given, I needed to share. As a child, and all through my life, I had always loved to give. Christmas was a favorite time of year and I&#8217;d always been called a generous person. I associated giving with joy, not heart wrenching pain, but perhaps during that difficult hour, I learned that it is never easy to give, if the gift is one you desperately want to keep for yourself. It takes grace to give.</p>

<p>By the grace of God, and his grace only, I bowed to His will. I died to my dreams and consecrated anew to live in a school. I fought a long, hard battle with self, but it ended with triumph. As I opened my eyes and wiped the tears from my face, I asked God to give me a scripture in His word. I opened my Bible, and turning the leaves, my eye fell upon the verse, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity; for God loveth a cheerful giver.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+9%3A7" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 9:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 9:7)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Calming my voice and controlling my will, I picked up the phone. &#8220;You know that house you offered me? Well, there is this family&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

<p>This could be the end of the article. After giving up my will to the Lord, I felt a joy and blessing that surrender brings. That didn&#8217;t mean that I no longer felt the stress of my situation, but I renewed my consecration and God gave me grace to face interminable time of living at the school.</p>

<p>Or so it looked interminable from my pinhole viewpoint. When I obeyed God in giving up my planned home, I didn&#8217;t see how I could live another day in school. And I certainly didn&#8217;t see how I was ever going to find another affordable place to live.</p>

<p>God, as always, had everything in control. As soon as I surrendered, He began working. A mere two weeks later I was moved into the home I thought I&#8217;d given up forever. Looking back I realized that God had been waiting for me to give everything&#8212;and when I did, He took over.</p>

<p>Tonight I sit typing on my computer in my cozy little living room, and as I reflect, I realize that we can never outgive God. In theory, I knew that before. Somehow the principle is so much closer than just a theory to me now&#8230;&#8203;it is a daily reality. Days now, I come home from a stressful day of school and settle in to make supper in my own kitchen. My eyes wander out the window to follow the bright jackets of my little girls playing down by the creek, and I think, &#8220;Lord, I asked for a place to live. I would have been happy for an apartment, and look what you gave me!&#8221; A place for my children to play&#8212;a grassy pasture, an old barn, a pond and a creek with many trees just right for climbing&#8212;somehow I think the Lord hand-picked this place out. In the mornings I can hear the birds singing, at night it is the frog&#8217;s turn to be musical. Country life, you might say, is always wonderful. Perhaps so, but each detail seems to me all the more precious because I gave it all up, and God gave it back.</p>

<p>Is God&#8217;s way best? Does it pay to yield our entire lives into His control? Is any sacrifice too great? No, God&#8217;s way is best even if it does not seem to be at the time of consecration. God&#8217;s way is best because it ends best.</p>

<h1>The Best Dentist</h1>

<p>I was playing tag at a campground with some friends younger than myself, and was intently running when a girl who was also running swiftly collided with me. It happened so fast I only knew it as I lay moaning on the ground, &#8220;Oh, my tooth, my tooth!&#8221; I was sure it was only hanging by a few nerves, it hurt so.</p>

<p>Eventually I was led to a nearby bench and lay there crying; why had this happened to me? The voice of God spoke to me, &#8220;Remember you told Me you had no faith I could heal anybody, only to clean up hearts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that I said, &#8216;I can persuade you that I have that kind of power, too&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, I remembered; He had told me that.</p>

<p>In my mind I was no longer lying on a picnic bench, but was in the dentist&#8217;s chair, my old dentist exclaiming, &#8220;Now how did you do that?! It&#8217;s going to be a bit painful, here&#8230;.&#8221; Then I turned and was surprised to see Jesus looking at me. In a twinkling He put on the dentist apparel&#8212;apron, mask and cap&#8212;which were lying on a table before Him. He looked big and strong, yet His manner bespoke gentleness; and His eyes&#8212;I never had seen His eyes with that look in them before&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;full of compassion&#8230;&#8203;and of great mercy.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+145%3A8" title="Psalm 145:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 145:8)</span></a></span> &#8220;I love you,&#8221; they said. I glanced at the regular dentist. Compared to Him, she looked rather shriveled up and shrunk in size. I shrugged my shoulders&#8212;not much of a choice, I thought; Jesus would do with one hand tied what that lady could at her ultimate best. &#8220;I choose You,&#8221; I whispered.</p>

<p>My tooth hurt horribly. With one probing finger I could &#8220;see&#8221; that it was pushed back halfway from its proper place to the roof of my mouth. It was not both front teeth as I had first feared; just the left one. But I couldn&#8217;t touch it; it hurt too much. I told Him that I simply couldn&#8217;t touch it, couldn&#8217;t stand it, let alone move it (as He had just said to do). Then He said, &#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll need this,&#8221; and He got out, to my amazement, one of those syringes and deftly filled it with whatever it is that deadens the nerves. Closer it came to my mouth and I shut my eyes (as I always do) so I wouldn&#8217;t have to see the wicked needle. And then my upper gum, left side, began to feel numb, until it was like I&#8217;ve felt before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; He said, &#8220;pull your tooth forward.&#8221; I put my finger behind and pushed. It came forward until it was a tooth&#8217;s width away from its real position.</p>

<p>At this point I became aware of the little crowd watching me. Suddenly feeling self-conscious, I sat up holding the tooth forward; little by little the crowd melted except my parents and a few other adults.</p>

<p>It must have been near to suppertime, for we went to the dining area and I sat at one of the tables. Most of the girls my age acted as though they thought I was a baby for sitting there holding up my tooth (for if I let up on the pressure, the pain would make me wish I could twist out of my body and leave it).</p>

<p>Then Jesus came by my lonely spot at the table; behind me He whispered, &#8220;Push it up some more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; I said, &#8220;it hurts too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you can,&#8221; He said. So I tried once more. And behold! It was so numb in that gum that I could not feel it unless I touched it with my finger. So I pushed up and outward until it was level with my other big tooth and got it wedged between the teeth on each side so it no longer slipped.</p>

<p><i>I was happy</i>; I realized Jesus cared for me whether others did or not. And He sure could throughly take care of the things I had to go through.</p>

<p>That numbing was deeper than any dentist I&#8217;ve ever had and lasted longer, too, and when it went away, it did not have that funny tingle; it just slipped away like it had come, so quietly.</p>

<p>I love this Doctor.</p>

<h1>Missionary Experiences in the West Indies</h1>

<p>It was a warm, sultry morning late in December. The tropical air was scarcely fanned by a breeze. The missionary heard the peculiar tapping of the postman at the gate and hurried to get his morning mail.</p>

<p>He took the single letter that was handed him, and with a pleasant nod to the postman broke the seal as he stepped back to the veranda.</p>

<p>It was a long letter; so before reading it the man sank into a chair and glanced away to the gleaming sea; but meeting only the dazzling light there, he let his eyes rest upon the distant blue-green mountains for a moment. Then for some time he was occupied with the contents of this lengthy letter. It was written in a neat, scholarly manner, and the missionary noted it all as he read.</p>

<p>As he finished reading, a bright-faced woman came through the garden with a baby in her arms. &#8220;Come here, Patience,&#8221; he said; and his wife came quickly to him. &#8220;Here is a letter, Patience, that requires very careful answering. You know how busy I am; so I will commit this into your care. This person, a Mr. K. L. Jones, has asked many questions on the church and other points of doctrine.&#8221; He looked up as he spoke, and, finding the baby holding out its chubby arms to him, he took it and handed the letter to his wife.</p>

<p>Thoughtfully she took it and began reading. She loved to write letters, and this, she felt, was her special part of the work. But here she perceived she had a task that was very difficult; for the writer, evidently a scholar, had put forth a dozen numbered questions that must be carefully answered or this dear soul would be hindered from walking in the truth. God would give the needed wisdom, she knew, and she folded the letter back into its envelope and sat meditating on the different points he had raised. After a while, she asked, &#8220;How was the meeting last night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good! Brother Owen spoke, and he did very well indeed. He used the text: <span class="scripture">&#8216;Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+15%3A8" title="John 15:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 15:8)</span></a></span> Several came forward for help afterwards.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, by the way, do you remember Sister Tilton? She was out to meeting last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sister Tilton? She must be a new sister!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well, perhaps we did not tell you about her. This young girl came to meeting once some time ago, but afterwards became very ill. Her folks wanted the doctor for her, but she refused, not telling them why. But as her sickness increased, they became alarmed and insisted on calling the doctor. But the girl still refused the medicine. The doctor said she would probably not live. Her people begged to know the reason for her refusal to take the medicine, and she then said that she had been to the church of God meeting and had been made very happy, and that she believed if they would send for the elders of that church she should be healed. So word came, and Brother Owen went and anointed her in accordance with <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+5%3A14-15">James 5:14-15</a>. She has been getting better right along, and tonight she was at the meeting. She is saved now, and seems to have a clear experience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221; was the hearty response. &#8220;How I should have loved to be at the meeting last night! But, for the present, here is my meeting, and here is my work,&#8221; and, catching up the baby and waving the letter happily, she ran into the house at the sound of children&#8217;s voices within.</p>

<p>After the baby had been bathed and put to sleep, and the other children were sitting quietly at play on the side veranda, Sister Patience settled herself with her Bible at her husband&#8217;s desk to answer this important letter. Bowing her head she besought God for this soul and for wisdom to answer his difficult questions aright. Then taking up her pen, she began the letter. She was so glad to write; she loved writing; and the joy of it always seemed to get into the very letters and shine back from the pages. She addressed Mr. Jones cordially and kindly, and then took up the substance of the letter itself. In calling his attention to certain truths she referred to the Bible time after time, and again and again she prayed, for the letter seemed particularly important to her. Long she meditated over some of the knotty questions, endeavoring to find the wisest explanation. Sometimes she was interrupted by the children just when she most needed to be quiet; but she had learned that interruptions often come as blessings in disguise, for often God had given thoughts that were clearer and better when she had patiently gone to attend to the children, and when she was free to return to her work she had found an answer preparing itself in her mind without an effort on her part. Thus, after several hours of close application, she finished the letter and sent it off with a trusting spirit.</p>

<p>Sister Patience hoped to receive an answer to her letter immediately, but week after week passed, and there was no response. Dread began to creep upon her that this soul would not accept the truth. She took him earnestly to God many times and trusted that God would in some way overrule. However, as four months passed and she had not heard again, she gave him over as being no longer interested.</p>

<p>Then it was that one morning there came, to her surprise, a letter in the same fine handwriting. How cordially he wrote! He thanked her for answering the former letter so fully and said he had been searching and proving her answers by the Word during the long interval. And now there were still a few points remaining that he disagreed with her upon; again she found a few numbered questions to answer.</p>

<p>These, like the first, were very shrewd, puzzling questions, and only sagacious answers would satisfy the inquirer. Again Sister Patience labored over the letter with prayer and meditation. Then, leaning hard upon God, she wrote another encouraging letter, setting forth expositions of Scripture as clearly as possible. This time she invited her correspondent to a series of meetings they were expecting to hold during the coming winter season, when they hoped to have with them one or two ministers from America for a short period.</p>

<p>Again she waited long for an answer; but this time she did not give him up. Several months passed, and then one of the brethren, a colporteur, came. He had been away for several months, and Sister Patience was very glad to see him.</p>

<p>&#8220;And tell me now, Brother Delworth,&#8221; she said, after the first greetings were over, &#8220;where have you been all this time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mostly in Arendon and Lawney. I went from Panville to Mayfield, and from there to Paldings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Paldings! You were at Paldings? Do you know one K. L. Jones?&#8221; asked Sister Patience with great interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, a fine old gentleman, a schoolteacher. He is saved. I sold him some books. He seems very much interested. And, by the way, he asked me to say to you when I should see you that he hoped to come over to the meeting next month, when the brethren are here from America. You will hear from him soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The time was drawing near for the coming of the brethren from America. Arrangements had been made for a meeting during their stay, which would be only for a few days. And then one day a letter came from Brother Jones inquiring as to the date of the meeting, and saying that if possible he should like to attend it. So again Sister Patience wrote him, urging him to be at the meeting, if possible.</p>

<p>Thus it was that during the exciting days of the meeting, when many from different parts of the country had gathered in to meet the brethren from America in this meeting, Sister Patience first met Brother Jones. One morning before meeting-time, she was passing through the little sitting-room in her home, when she noticed a fine-looking native man of venerable appearance sitting at one side of the room. People were all about him, but he was looking over some tracts that had been handed him. Making her way to him, she said, &#8220;Good morning, Brother, I have not met you before, have I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, no,&#8221; he said, and, quickly rising, he gave her a courteous bow. &#8220;Can this be Sister Patience? My name is K. L. Jones, of Paldings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How glad I am to meet you!&#8221; she replied. And then followed an animated conversation in which she was able to recognize and admire the fine qualities of his matured mind. Finally he expressed the desire to speak with the foreign brethren himself, and so an audience was arranged for him after the next service. Then it was, Sister Patience learned afterwards, that Brother Jones inquired deeply into the subjects of sanctification and baptism. Later in the day it was announced that there would be a baptismal service early the next morning to accommodate Brother Jones, who was to return home by an early train.</p>

<p>Some years have passed since then. God has wonderfully used the dear old brother, and a congregation has been raised up about him, who look up to him as their pastor.</p>

<p>These are backward mountain people where he has labored, yet such has been his patience and faithfulness and love that they have become established in holiness and truth. Brother Jones, as we call him, is becoming feeble now, but he is still standing faithful as the shepherd of this little flock, faithful unto death.</p>

<p>Does it pay to use patience and prayer when dealing with precious souls? Ah, yes; eternity alone can tell all that it means.</p>

<h1>Very Present Help</h1>

<h2 class="subtitle">A sister&#8217;s testimony of God working in afflictions</h2>
<p>I am glad God doesn&#8217;t forget about us. It&#8217;s only by God&#8217;s <span class="scripture">&#8220;very present help,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+46%3A1" title="Psalm 46:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 46:1)</span></a></span> moment by moment, that we can overcome our enemies. I am thankful that God never lets us down. The Lord has helped me to be able to teach this spring (except for a few days). In the last few weeks I have been sick twice with asthma. The first time I was brought very low&#8212;but the Lord&#8217;s grace each moment brought me through. After that I felt very afraid that I should come down sick again. I was glad for the Lord&#8217;s help through the trial but I felt like I couldn&#8217;t bear the same trial again (I usually only have about one or two bad attacks of asthma in a year). Well, I came down sick again. It looked very dark. Like the songwriter put it, &#8220;When the darkness seems to gather just as far as you can see.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/The_Sun_Behind_the_Cloud/index.html" title="The Sun Behind the Cloud">*</a></p>

<p>That first evening, I believe, Daddy was going to call our pastor&#8217;s family for prayer (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+5%3A14-15">James 5:14-15</a>). He asked me what I wanted them to pray for so everything would be clear for <span class="scripture">&#8220;the prayer of faith.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+5%3A15" title="James 5:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 5:15)</span></a></span> All I could think about was that night before me, and I was afraid. I asked that they would pray that the fears would have to go. I found that I couldn&#8217;t pray &#8220;I&#8217;m putting my trust in You, Lord,&#8221; because the fears were too strong. The Lord then brought Brother David&#8217;s testimony to mind: <span class="scripture">&#8220;I sought the Lord, and He heard me, and delivered me from <b>all</b> my fears.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+34%3A4" title="Psalm 34:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 34:4)</span></a></span> That was my prayer.</p>

<p>And the Lord heard. My sister had been reading me a book to help me not think of and pity myself. In the book the scripture was quoted about the women who went to the sepulchre, <span class="scripture">&#8220;And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun. And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre? And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+16%3A2-4" title="Mark 16:2-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 16:2-4)</span></a></span> The Lord spoke to me and said&#8212;&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I roll away the stone&#8212;the <span class="scripture">&#8220;very great&#8221;</span> stone for them? Trust me with tonight&#8212;with this trial. When you come to that place where it is rough going, I will roll away the stone.&#8221; And right then He made the fears go and I had peace. Isn&#8217;t the Lord good?</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s not all, the Lord enabled me to sleep most of the night without hindering the sleep of others who were preparing for a trip. Before, the muscles in my back had been so sore that I hadn&#8217;t been able to relax and sleep. The next night (If I remember right) I was able to sleep lying down in my bed. The Lord isn&#8217;t without compassion on our frame. <span class="scripture">&#8220;It is of the Lord&#8217;s mercies that we are not consumed, because His compassions fail not. They are new <b>every</b> morning: great is Thy faithfulness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Lamentations+3%3A22-23" title="Lamentations 3:22-23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Lamentations 3:22-23)</span></a></span> The Lord won&#8217;t give us one trial too much. I definitely couldn&#8217;t have made it safely through these trials without the Lord&#8217;s <span class="scripture">&#8220;very present help.&#8221;</span> Praise Him!</p>

<h1>Just Mary: Part 2</h1>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">In this continuation of our story, Roy reaches a pivotal crisis in his young life, while trouble also comes to the family of his beloved niece.</p>
</div>


<hr class="minor" />
<p>Spring waned and summer set in with its scorching heat. Many of the creeks in the country had gone dry, and numbers of the country folk were without good water, and many were becoming ill with that dreadful disease, typhoid. The latter part of August a letter came from Elsie, informing them that Dan had not been well for some time, and was now not able to be out of bed, and she feared he had the fever. She also stated her own physical condition and what it would mean should Dan be sick any length of time. Another letter two days later informed them Dan really had the fever and was continually raging and asked if someone could not help her out. Immediately Mother Harmon made ready and went to her.</p>

<p>Dan lay for weeks in a delirious condition and they despaired of his life. After several weeks he began to amend, but the fever left him in such a weakened condition that he needed constant care for some time, and Mother Harmon stayed on. Although Dan began to improve another care came to Mother Harmon, for Elsie presented her husband at this time with a new son which she named Otis Harmon. This only increased the burden upon Mother Harmon&#8217;s tired body as she cared for Dan, who in his weakened condition required special attention, and then to care for Elsie and the new baby. Mary had been sent to an aunt, who tried to help out in this way. It seemed difficult to get anyone to assist as all feared the disease and thought it might be they too would come down with it. When baby Otis was ten days old, Mother Harmon became ill, and after a few days had to return to her own home. This left Elsie to care for her baby and also to do many other duties about the place which were too much of a burden for her in her present physical condition. The aunt who had kept Mary during Dan&#8217;s illness now came to render what assistance she could, but it was not like when Mother Harmon had been there and many strenuous tasks that should not have been Elsie&#8217;s were done by her. Dan gained strength rapidly, but Elsie could not recover from that tired, distressed feeling all the time.</p>

<p>Mother Harmon returned home and for some time seemed to be on the way to recovery. The physician told them a few weeks of complete rest would soon put her on her feet again and she would be able to be about her duties in the home. But it seemed she was slow in gaining strength, although she was not confined to her bed all the time. October passed, and November came in with its cold, windy weather. A light snow had fallen, and Father Harmon laid in a good supply of wood that Mother Harmon would have plenty to keep the house warm without having to step outside to get it. She had prepared the morning&#8217;s meal and after lying down to rest, arose and began to tidy up the house a little. As she bent over the big wood box to get some wood for the stove, she was seized with a peculiar feeling and fell on the floor, where she was found when Father Harmon entered the house some time later. She was unable to assist herself in any way and could scarcely speak, but after some effort made them to understand how it all occurred. A physician was immediately summoned, who pronounced her case an attack of paralysis and her condition serious. All was done for her that could be done, but at the end of the third day, while Father Harmon, David, and Roy stood about her bed, Mother Harmon passed into eternity.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>What a blow this was to the family, and especially to Roy, for she had been the one who understood, the one in whom he could confide and feel that there was something akin in her own heart to that which he felt! Where would he go now and to whom could he turn? No tears came to him to relieve him, but his pale face and quivering body told of a grief that had struck deeply, eating into the heart&#8217;s core. When her body was laid in the casket and the family gathered about, Roy stood speechless, staring at the remains of her who had been all to him that a mother could be and his sole confidant and the one who understood. No tears came to his relief, but his body trembled as one with a chill, and his face paled so that all could see his grief was too deep for tears.</p>

<p>Mother Harmon had been gone two weeks, when one evening Roy saddled one of the horses and, leading it from the stable, started to mount, when his father called to him to know what he meant to do. Upon being informed that he meant to go to the cemetery Father Harmon began to remonstrate as there was a storm approaching. The lightning was flashing across the sky, the thunder was rolling, and the blackened clouds spoke of a real downpour of rain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Son,&#8221; said Father Harmon, &#8220;don&#8217;t you know that you will be drenched, for you will not get to the cemetery before the storm will break? You must not go now.&#8221;</p>

<p>But no amount of persuasion was of avail, and as Roy mounted the horse he said, &#8220;I have stood it as long as I can, Papa, and I must go. I want to tell Mother just how I feel, for she was the only one who ever understood me. I am sure now that she will understand. I want to tell her that I mean to follow in her footsteps. I can&#8217;t bear it any longer, and I must go. I shall tell her I am coming after her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Father Harmon shook with emotion as he said, &#8220;If that be the case, go, Son, and God be with you to protect you.&#8221; Roy rode off into the gathering storm toward the place where rested the body of her that had meant so much to him. On he rode and as he neared the cemetery the storm broke upon him in all its fury. The wind blew until it seemed he could scarcely retain his seat in the saddle; still he rode on. The rain came down in sheets, but on he went.</p>

<p>Soon he was beside a newly-made mound. As he knelt beside it, while the rain poured down upon him and the lightning flashed about him and the thunder roared above and about him, Roy poured out his heart unto his mother&#8217;s God and in doing so found relief in an outpouring of tears. For some time he knelt there weeping as only one can in such circumstances, but as weeping subsided, he lifted his voice in supplication to God and there beside the grave of his mother while the elements roared about him Roy found the peace for which his troubled soul had been longing and the assurance that some day he would meet his mother again. The storm abated, and as Roy arose from his knees, looking down on the grave of the one who meant so much to him, he said, &#8220;Oh Mother, I had to come to you again, for you are the only one who really understood me, and I am sure that you understand me now. I have made your God my God, and mean to follow in your footsteps, and some day we shall meet again.&#8221; He then mounted his horse and rode back home. Although the emptiness of his heart which had been made by the death of his mother had not been filled, relief had come in tears and the decision which he had made had brought a deep settled peace in his soul that eased the heavy ache in his heart. The rain had ceased, and the evening had become chilly, but although Roy had been drenched he did not feel the chilly winds that followed the storm. He had found the relief for which his soul had longed and balm for his aching heart.</p>

<p>Upon arriving home, after unsaddling and unbridling his horse, Roy walked into the house, where he met his father who had not ceased to walk to and fro across the floor all the time that he had been gone. Going across the floor toward him, Roy laid his hand on his father&#8217;s shoulder and said, &#8220;I have settled it, Papa, and have found the relief that I desired. I have made Mama&#8217;s God my God also, and I knew that Mama would understand. I found the relief while kneeling beside her grave, and I know that I shall meet her again someday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Father Harmon clasped his son in his arms and heavy sobs shook his frame. Tears now came to Roy&#8217;s relief, and the two sobbed out an understanding of each other. The storm had opened up a new day for each of them.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>After the storm the thermometer began to drop, and when morning dawned the ground was frozen and winter had set in in earnest. Thanksgiving found the streams all frozen and shortly after a snowfall which never entirely melted away until the spring thaw. Many times in the winter the roads were impassable because of the drifted snow. All this time Roy and his father lived secluded lives, unable to get away except the snow hardened and they could walk over the fences and over the drifts. What a lonely life it was without her who had meant so much to the household! Roy&#8217;s grief increased as the days lengthened into weeks, and the deep snow kept them penned in through the long, cold winter. How he longed at times to be able just to visit the cemetery, but in this he was disappointed for the roads were impassable! He felt that just to be near her would ease the aching in his heart. He mentioned this to his father one evening as they sat beside the fire. As the father drew his chair near that of his youngest son, his own voice trembled with emotion. He said, &#8220;Roy, do you not remember the night when you received your diploma from the hand of our county superintendent, stating that you had finished the course prescribed by the common school law?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely I remember it,&#8221; replied Roy, &#8220;but what has that to do with me now? It brings me no comfort in the loss of Mama,&#8221; and, burying his head in his arms, he sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>Father Harmon was so overcome that he could not speak for some time, but with all the effort that he could put forth Father Harmon spoke again, &#8220;And do you remember how proud your mother was of you that night after you delivered your oration at the commencement exercises, and then framed your diploma for you and hung it in your room?&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy nodded his head, and his father continued, &#8220;How would you have felt had she wept and cried when you received your diploma and sat about grieving and weeping because you had finished the graded school and had she refused to sign your report card?&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy looked up into his father&#8217;s face with a quizzical expression in his eyes, as he asked, &#8220;Papa, why do you ask me such questions when you know that Mama could never have done such a thing as that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know she would not have done such a thing as that,&#8221; replied Father Harmon, &#8220;but what would you have thought had she done such, and how would you have felt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have felt very bad, I am sure,&#8221; said Roy, &#8220;and would have thought she didn&#8217;t want me to finish high school, but that is not to be thought of, for it was so unlike Mama to do any such thing as that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you get any pleasure when you received your diploma?&#8221; inquired Father Harmon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say that I did,&#8221; replied Roy, &#8220;for I felt that I was walking in the air when I stepped down off that platform carrying that roll of paper in my hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so,&#8221; said Father Harmon, &#8220;but what would it have been had your mother refused to sign your report cards?&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy straightened himself in his chair as be said, &#8220;Papa, why do you talk like that when you know that she never felt like she wanted to return my card unsigned, for I always made good grades; and she was pleased to sign my cards?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure that she was,&#8221; replied Father Harmon, &#8220;and will you be pleased to sign hers now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know what you mean by saying that,&#8221; said Roy, in a perplexed tone of voice.</p>

<p>Here Father Harmon laid his arm on his son&#8217;s shoulder and, while his voice trembled with emotion, he said, &#8220;I mean just this, Son: your mother has finished in the great school of life to receive her diploma from the great Master&#8217;s hand which is a crown of life, and he has presented her report card to you for you to sign, and are you ashamed to do so?&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy laid his head on his father&#8217;s shoulder and sobbed aloud as he said, &#8220;Oh, no, no, a thousand times no. I am not ashamed of the report of her life, for it was perfect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you then sign the card?&#8221; inquired his father. &#8220;All that you have to do is to say, &#8216;Amen, Lord. Thy will, not mine, be done.&#8217; In this way you can enter into the joys and pleasures which are sure to be hers in the great commencement of Eternal Life, and although it does not fill the vacancy left, it does ease the heartache. Will you do it, Son?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do my best,&#8221; replied Roy, as he gazed into his father&#8217;s face. And he did, for from that time on there was a sweetness attached to the death of his mother which he had never gotten before, and although it did not dry the tears which would often start when thinking of her who meant so much to him, he surrendered and submitted it all to him who understands all things, and in this he found great comfort. The conversation between Father and Son on that evening around the fire also brought them closer together, and some of the companionship which had been between Mother and Son was now transmitted to Father; so that many pleasant evenings were spent together during the long, cold, wintry nights.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>There had been no mail delivery at the Harmon home for two weeks, and then came three letters from Elsie. These were opened according to the date of mailing and in each she informed them of her physical condition. It seemed that she had begun work too soon after the birth of baby Otis, and she could gain no strength. In the second letter opened she told them she meant to go to a specialist the next day and would write more when she knew more. So the next letter was to contain the desired news of her condition, and Roy opened it quickly and began reading. It stated that the specialist had found her tubercular and he also found that baby Otis was blind. He was not qualified to examine the baby&#8217;s eyes perfectly as that was not his specialty, but they meant to take him to an eye specialist and see if it really were true. This was done; and another letter later told of the hopelessness of the baby&#8217;s ever seeing anything, for he was born without vision and would have to remain that way so long as he lived. Elsie also stated she was getting weaker all the time and having those dreadful night sweats. Each letter contained news of Mary&#8217;s progress in learning to spell and to read and write. Occasionally there would be a short note written to Uncle Roy, in her own hand.</p>

<p>April came, and with it the busy time of farming. It kept Roy and his father busy on the farm to prepare meals and then do the work about the place, but as a great deal of the farm was in pasture, not much plowing needed to be done in the spring and this Roy did, leaving all the lighter work about the place for his father to do. The latter part of April brought news to them that Elsie could not get well and her time was short, as she was failing fast; so Father Harmon and Roy went to her. David could not be persuaded to go, although Elsie begged to see him. He had told his father so often that he was making his own way, that when he did not have the means to take him to her, he refused the proffered help of his father. So the two went, remaining with Elsie until the first week in May, when she passed into eternity, leaving Mary, age four, and baby Otis, eight months. This was surely a hard blow for Dan, for who would want to take care of a blind baby?</p>

<p>But baby Otis was a lovable child and of a pleasant disposition. Like all blind unfortunates he had a keen ear, and what he failed to possess with his eyes did not escape his ears; and he was a merry little fellow. Mary loved him to adoration and was never too busy in her play not to stop when she could do something to amuse her baby brother.</p>

<p>The death of Elsie brought Roy and &#8220;Peachy&#8221; together again and with the same love as before. But there must be another separation, for Roy must return with his father to their own home. As Roy clasped Dan&#8217;s hand, he said with quivering voice, &#8220;I cannot do anything now for Elsie&#8217;s children, but I mean to someday and you may count on me for it, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother Dennison came to aid Dan in taking care of the children, and she took special interest in Mary, teaching her many little rhymes and children&#8217;s songs and also giving her some light duties about the house which were hers exclusively. She filled the wood box, carried kindling, dusted the furniture, and did many other things about the place until she was called &#8220;Grandma&#8217;s Little Helper.&#8221; Baby Otis was not neglected in any way, for Mary and Grandma took special care of him; and Dan seemed to live only for his children. He had seemed fond of them before Elsie&#8217;s death, but now he seemed to lavish all his affection on them. Each evening found him with one on each of his knees, singing to them, or romping with them on the floor. He prepared each of them for bed and dressed them in the mornings. When Grandma Dennison spoke to him about it and said she could do it very well, he replied, &#8220;All the pleasure I have now is in my children; don&#8217;t deny me this.&#8221; So no more was said about it, and thus the early part of Mary&#8217;s childhood was spent with an adoring father.</p>

<h1>En Voyage</h1>

<p class="author">Charlotte A. Mason</p>

<p class="verse">Whichever way the wind doth blow,
<br />Some heart is glad to have it so;
<br />Then blow it east, or blow it west,
<br />The wind that blows, that wind is best.</p>

<p class="verse">My little craft sails not alone;
<br />A thousand fleets from every zone
<br />Are out upon a thousand seas;
<br />What lows for one a favoring breeze
<br />Might dash another, with the shock
<br />Of doom, upon some hidden rock.
<br />And so I do not dare to pray
<br />For winds to waft me on my way,
<br />But leave it to a Higher Will
<br />To stay or speed me, trusting still
<br />That all is well, and sure that He
<br />Who launched my bark will sail with me,
<br />Through storm and calm, and will not fail,
<br />Whatever breezes may prevail,
<br />To land me, every peril past,
<br />Within His sheltering haven at last.</p>

<p class="verse">Then, whatsoever wind doth blow,
<br />My heart is glad to have it so;
<br />And blow it east or blow it west,
<br />The wind that blows, that wind is best.</p>
