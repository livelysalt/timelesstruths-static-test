<hr class="minor" />
<p>The foregoing scriptures are but a few out of the many plain texts from the word of God teaching us the glorious doctrine of holiness. Some professing Christians look upon this doctrine as unscriptural and impracticable, but in the light of the gospel of Christ there is no other doctrine taught than holiness. The very fact that God, and Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit, the word of God, and heaven, and all the celestial hosts are holy, at once suggests to every reasonable mind the utter necessity of holiness in the heart and life of man. The apostle says that <span class="scripture">&#8220;we are his workmanship, created in Jesus Christ unto good works.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+2%3A10" title="Ephesians 2:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 2:10)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Were we to look upon depraved humanity in the image of Adam, we would see nothing but sin and unholiness; but God has brought into existence a new order of creation in Christ Jesus. The first Adam is a sad and irreparable failure, and in him we see nothing good. All who are living according to the flesh are dead in trespasses and sins, and of course are unholy; but the second Adam, which is Christ has brought redemption and life, in whom there is purity and holiness. The old man is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts, which <b>must be put off</b>. The new man is created in righteousness and true holiness, which <b>must be put on</b>. The reason some do not comprehend the doctrine of holiness is, they are yet living in the old creation, hence their nature and mind are corrupt. It is utterly impossible for such to be holy in this condition. The command, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Be ye holy,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+1%3A15-16" title="I&nbsp;Peter 1:15-16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 1:15-16)</span></a></span> does not apply to them. They are not God&#8217;s people. The first step for such to take is to repent, which if they obey they will be brought into the kingdom of God&#8217;s holiness; into the new creation, the workmanship of God in Christ Jesus. Bless the Lord, O my soul, for this new creation of purity and holiness. All the living creatures of heaven bow before him that sitteth upon the throne, saying, Holy, holy, holy! and every sanctified heart on earth can join the blessed anthem of praise and adoration with the consciousness that the all-cleansing blood of Christ has reached its inmost depth and purified it for the habitation of the heavenly guest, the Holy Spirit. The pure heart is God&#8217;s dwelling-place on earth. Jesus says <span class="scripture">&#8220;If a man love me, he will keep my words and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+14%3A23" title="John 14:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 14:23)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Thus we see that God not only dwells in the high and holy heaven, but also upon earth in the hearts of His obedient people. Who could consistently believe that God would dwell in a corrupt heart? <span class="scripture">&#8220;He&#8230;&#8203;shall be in you,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+14%3A17" title="John 14:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 14:17)</span></a></span> is the promise of Jesus. <span class="scripture">&#8220;At that day [the day when the Holy Spirit comes into the heart], ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+14%3A20" title="John 14:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 14:20)</span></a></span> Oh, the depths of the riches of this wonderful redemption, that God would forgive the guilty sinner, then purify his heart and make it His earthly abode. This is His will toward every son and daughter of Adam&#8217;s race. He will create us in the image of Christ, so that we may truly serve Him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life. This can be called none other than the way of holiness. It is God&#8217;s own way, and is truly a highway too high for anything unclean to pass over. It is on a perfect level with heaven itself, and yet it is a highway here upon earth for all the ransomed of the Lord to travel upon. It is so plain and simple that no one need be led astray. <span class="scripture">&#8220;The wayfaring men though fools, shall not err therein.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+35%3A8" title="Isaiah 35:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 35:8)</span></a></span> A wayfaring man means one who is on the way, one who lives on the way, as a seafaring man is one who lives on the sea. This way is so safe that though a man may be simple in the estimation of the world, and may be called a fool, yet if he keeps obedient to God he shall not be led astray. <span class="scripture">&#8220;No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+35%3A9" title="Isaiah 35:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 35:9)</span></a></span> This indicates a very safe way, where we need not fear any evil. Everything of the flesh or the old man is ruled out, and none but the redeemed shall walk there. We see therefore from the description of the prophet that this is a highway, a clean way, a simple way, a safe way, a way of songs and everlasting joy, which necessarily constitutes a way of holiness.</p>

<p>This is the way upon which the people of God are truly returning to Zion. This Zion is the scriptural name of the church of God. The people of God have been led into captivity of ecciestiastical bondage (Babylon), and the pure light of the gospel of holiness has been darkened by the creeds and doctrines of men, but God is revealing to His own that sanctification is a Bible doctrine; they seek for, and obtain it, and thereby every sectarian yoke is broken, His people find themselves upon this highway of holiness and at home in Zion, the church, free from the bondage of sectism. This is the work of God Himself, and will not cease until every one of His people are brought home to Zion, upon the way of holiness. This is the highway that is left <span class="scripture">&#8220;for the remnant of his people.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+11%3A16" title="Isaiah 11:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 11:16)</span></a></span> This remnant shall be gathered out of all the creeds of men into the one fold, into the true unity of Christ. <span class="scripture">&#8220;For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+2%3A11" title="Hebrews 2:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 2:11)</span></a></span></p>

<p>The prophet foresaw this blessed return of the people of God and tells us <span class="scripture">&#8220;they shall call them, The holy people.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+62%3A12" title="Isaiah 62:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 62:12)</span></a></span> There are some who call themselves holiness people, but the prophet says we shall be called, <span class="scripture">&#8220;The holy people.&#8221;</span> Holiness factions and sects have actually sprung into existence, which declare that sectism and division is necessary. This class of holiness is not that described in the foregoing scriptures. Bible holiness will in every individaul instance destroy everything out of men&#8217;s hearts that separates or divides. Divisions are the outgrowth of carnality and not of the Spirit of God. Every profession of holiness, therefore, which sanctions division and sectism cannot possibly be the holiness of the Bible. This may seem to some a strong assertion, but it will stand the test of the word of God.</p>

<p>No scriptural unity will ever be effected among the people of God outside the experience of sanctification. Men have repeatedly laid other foundations, but all to no avail. It is a source of great satisfaction to know that wherever the Holy Spirit has the right of way in the hearts of men, there is found true apostolic unity, both in spirit and in doctrine. This is a well authenticated fact which is demonstrated in thousands of hearts today. The holy people are one people, and all are willing to be measured by all of the word of God, which proves to the <span class="scripture">&#8220;All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+3%3A16-17" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 3:16-17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 3:16-17)</span></a></span> The apostle teaches us that God imparts unto us his holiness: we are <span class="scripture">&#8220;partakers&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A10" title="Hebrews 12:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 12:10)</span></a></span> of it. It is not an experience which we by our efforts can attain to, but upon the clearly defined conditions of His word we come into possession of his holiness. It is all wrought within us by Himself. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+3%3A5" title="Titus 3:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Titus 3:5)</span></a></span> Bible holiness is truly an imported article directly from God out of heaven. Some imported goods in this country are much more expensive and of better quality than those of home manufacture. Many of our people prefer to pay the extra expense in order to obtain the better quality, and usually are abundantly satisfied with their purchase. This may serve to illustrate this blessed holiness of the Bible. Men&#8217;s professions are sometimes like an inferior homemade piece of goods. It soon wears threadbare and betrays its quality, but the genuine imported article of Bible holiness proves satisfactory in every respect, and the more it is worn the better it becomes. It has cost us everything, but it proves to be worth more than everything to us. The reason why some people have failed to get it is, they are unwilling to pay the price. They are deceived by the false doctrine that they do not need to consecrate their all, and hence have accepted a holiness manufactured by man, a homemade article which will never stand the test. A definite, absolute consecration to the loss of all things will never fail to procure the genuine article of true Bible holiness, which will stand the wear of every trial of life and the test of the judgment.</p>
