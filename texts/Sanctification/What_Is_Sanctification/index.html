<h1>What Is Sanctification?</h1>

<p>Scripturally, the word <i>sanctification</i> has three meanings: First, separation; second, dedication; third, spiritfilling. Webster&#8217;s definition of it is as follows: &#8220;1. Sanctification is the act of God&#8217;s grace by which the affections of man are purified, or alienated from sin and the world, and exalted to a supreme love of God; also, the state of being thus purified or sanctified. 2. The act of consecrating, or setting apart for a sacred purpose.&#8221; &#8220;<b>Sanctifier</b>. One who sanctifies or makes holy; specifically, the Holy Ghost.&#8221; &#8220;<b>Sanctify</b>. 1. To set apart to a holy or religious use. 2. To make holy or free from sin; to cleanse from moral corruption or pollution; to make holy by detaching the affections from the world and its defilements and exalting them to a supreme love of God.&#8221; Scripturally and practically, the terms sanctification, holiness, purity, and perfection are synonymous. <b>Holiness</b>. Separation: setting apart; sacredness. <b>Purity</b>. Cleanness; chastity. <b>Perfection</b>. Completeness; wholeness. All this is comprehended in one word, <b>sanctification</b>.</p>

<p>It is evident that this term signifies much more in the New Testament sense than it does in the Old Testament. In the Old Testament it meant but a dedication, a setting apart to a holy use, as in the example of the sanctification of the tabernacle and its contents&#8212;the altar and layer, and all the vessels belonging thereto&#8212;and Aaron and his sons and their garments (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Leviticus+8%3A10-30">Leviticus 8:10-30</a>). In this dispensation of grace it means infinitely more; for in that dispensation it was but an outward and ceremonial work, but now it is an inwrought work, permeating and purifying the affections through and through by the cleansing blood and heavenly fire, and filling the dedicated temple, our body, with the Holy Ghost, as in the example of the early church at Pentecost.</p>

<p>The justified believer must meet the conditions of complete separation and exclusive dedication of himself to God, in a sense that no guilty sinner can do. This is the believer&#8217;s part. He must purify himself. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+3%3A3" title="I&nbsp;John 3:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 3:3)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+7%3A1" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 7:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 7:1)</span></a></span> This brings the believer into the condition where God can fulfill His part. He can now take exclusive possession of the dedicated temple, and sanctify it. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=l+Thessalonians+5%3A23" title="l Thessalonians 5:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (l Thessalonians 5:23)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+2%3A4" title="Acts 2:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 2:4)</span></a></span> This brings the believer into a more perfect spiritual relationship with God than when simply justified.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>These and many other texts of scripture teach us that sanctification is a Bible doctrine. There is but one reason why some people cannot see it in the Bible&#8212;their eyes are blinded. All who are willing to yield themselves to God and His word, will soon be taught this blessed truth. Jesus prayed that His disciples might become sanctified. They had not yet come into this experience. Jesus knew that they needed it. It was His desire for their highest good. They were not able to go forth and cope with the powers of sin. They had been under the teaching of the Master and in His presence, and therefore were protected by Him from the enemy but now he was soon to be taken from them, and He knew that they must be <span class="scripture">&#8220;endued with power from on high.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+24%3A49" title="Luke 24:49"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 24:49)</span></a></span> Therefore He implored the Father for the sanctification of the eleven; and not <span class="scripture">&#8220;for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+17%3A20" title="John 17:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 17:20)</span></a></span> This reaches down through the entire gospel dispensation. It is His blessed will that we all shall be sanctified. As justified believers, we each are as needy of this grace as were the eleven disciples. It is indispensible for our spiritual welfare.</p>

<p>Some are disposed to look upon this matter as optional with them; but such is a mistake. The time comes in the experience of every true believer when the Holy Spirit brings before him the conditions of a definite and absolute consecration. A refusal to meet these conditions, done ignorantly, will bring a cloud over our experience of justification and, eventually, if persisted in wilfully, will bring us into God&#8217;s utter disapproval. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+4%3A17" title="James 4:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 4:17)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Sanctification is the normal state of the Christian. The Father, Son and Holy Spirit are jointly interested in us, that we attain unto this grace. Our unity with the Godhead is incomplete without it, so also is our unity with each other; <span class="scripture">&#8220;For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+2%3A11" title="Hebrews 2:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 2:11)</span></a></span> A heart washed and made pure by the blood of Christ and filled with the Holy Spirit will always be in perfect fellowship with divinity, and also with all other hearts of like experience. The unsanctified heart of the believer cannot be fully satisfied, because of the consciousness of the presence of the carnal nature, more scripturally called <span class="scripture">&#8220;our old man.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+6%3A6" title="Romans 6:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 6:6)</span></a></span> Just what it is may not perhaps be perfectly understood by the new convert, but that something abnormal exists will soon be discovered, and there will be a longing in the heart for an inward cleansing&#8212;a normal desire for the normal experience. On the other hand, when this blessed experience is attained, there comes with it the consciousness of inward purity which fully satisfies the heart, and it can sing with the spirit and with the understanding,</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Hallelujah for the cleansing;
<br />It has reached my inmost soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>For this purpose Christ gave Himself for the church&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;That he might sanctify and cleanse it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A26" title="Ephesians 5:26"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 5:26)</span></a></span> God gave Him to the world that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life, for our justification; but Christ gave Himself for the church, for our sanctification.</p>

<p>The gospel commission of the apostle Paul specifies clearly the doctrine of sanctification, the <span class="scripture">&#8220;inheritance among them which are sanctified.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+26%3A18" title="Acts 26:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 26:18)</span></a></span> He could not have been faithful to this commission without leading souls from <span class="scripture">&#8220;forgiveness of sins&#8221;</span> into this <span class="scripture">&#8220;inheritance.&#8221;</span> His ministry and epistles to the different churches prove his faithfulness. Upon his first acquaintance with the brethren at Ephesus be asked them the question, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+19%3A2" title="Acts 19:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 19:2)</span></a></span> And after three years of faithful ministry in that city, upon the solemn event of his departure from them, among his last words he reminds the church of the <span class="scripture">&#8220;inheritance among all them which are sanctified.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+20%3A32" title="Acts 20:32"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 20:32)</span></a></span> Then about four years later, while a prisoner at Rome, he writes back to them his epistle to the Ephesians, which in every chapter sparkles with beautiful gems of thought upon the subject of sanctification.

<p>In the first and second epistles to the Corinthians we also notice the mention of this experience, and that there were some saints at Corinth that were sanctified (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+1%3A2%2C30">I&nbsp;Corinthians 1:2,30</a>), although some were not, and were told that they were yet carnal. There were evidently only the two classes&#8212;sanctified and justified, in the church there, the same as is usually the case everywhere today. In speaking of the congregation, he says <span class="scripture">&#8220;But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+6%3A11" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 6:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 6:11)</span></a></span> In the second epistle, he exhorts them: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+7%3A1" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 7:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 7:1)</span></a></span> and among the closing words of this letter, he says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Be perfect.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+13%3A11" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 13:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 13:11)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Thus we can see in all the epistles of this apostle, the theme of sanctification. His personal testimony to the Galatians reads: <span class="scripture">&#8220;I am crucified with Christ.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+2%3A20" title="Galatians 2:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 2:20)</span></a></span> His statement to the brethren at Philippi was: <span class="scripture">&#8220;As many as be perfect&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+3%3A15" title="Philippians 3:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 3:15)</span></a></span>; to those at Colosse: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+3%3A3" title="Colossians 3:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 3:3)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;Ye have put off the old man with his deeds; And have put on the new man&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+3%3A9-10" title="Colossians 3:9-10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 3:9-10)</span></a></span>; his teaching in the epistles to the Thessalonians, showing them that sanctification is the will of God to them, and his desire that the <span class="scripture">&#8220;God of peace sanctify you wholly.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+5%3A23" title="I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:23)</span></a></span> His instructions to Timothy show how we may become a vessel <span class="scripture">&#8220;sanctified, and meet for the master&#8217;s use,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A21" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 2:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 2:21)</span></a></span> and he refers to the fact that there were some who <span class="scripture">&#8220;call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A22" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 2:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 2:22)</span></a></span> His letter to Titus, in which he mentions how Jesus gave Himself for us, that He might <span class="scripture">&#8220;purify unto himself a peculiar people.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+2%3A14" title="Titus 2:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Titus 2:14)</span></a></span> These all add testimony to this doctrine and the apostle&#8217;s faithfulness in his ministry. Some scholars think Apollos is the author of the epistle to the Hebrews; but whether Paul or Apollos, it abounds with truth upon sanctification.</p>

<p>All the other writers of the New Testament teach the same truth. James says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Purify your hearts, ye double minded.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+4%3A8" title="James 4:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 4:8)</span></a></span> Peter gives emphasis to the doctrine of holiness: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Be ye holy,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+1%3A15" title="I&nbsp;Peter 1:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 1:15)</span></a></span> and that <span class="scripture">&#8220;we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+2%3A24" title="I&nbsp;Peter 2:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 2:24)</span></a></span>; and desires that the God of all grace <span class="scripture">&#8220;make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+3%3A14" title="II&nbsp;Peter 3:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 3:14)</span></a></span>; and that at the coming of Christ <span class="scripture">&#8220;ye may be found of him in peace, without spot and blameless.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;q=ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless " title=""><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> ()</span></a></span> Jude addresses his epistle <span class="scripture">&#8220;to them that are sanctified&#8230;&#8203;and preserved.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jude+1%3A1" title="Jude 1:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jude 1:1)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Then when we search the writings of John we are almost overwhelmed with glory, as we read his beautiful teachings upon this theme, which he so clearly sets forth. God grant that we all may <span class="scripture">&#8220;walk in the light as he is in the light,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1%3A7" title="I&nbsp;John 1:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 1:7)</span></a></span> walking <span class="scripture">&#8220;even as he walked,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+2%3A6" title="I&nbsp;John 2:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 2:6)</span></a></span> that His love in us may be <span class="scripture">&#8220;perfected,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+2%3A5" title="I&nbsp;John 2:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 2:5)</span></a></span> that we may prayerfully hold fast and abide in this <span class="scripture">&#8220;unction from the Holy One,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+2%3A20" title="I&nbsp;John 2:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 2:20)</span></a></span> that the <span class="scripture">&#8220;anointing&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+2%3A27" title="I&nbsp;John 2:27"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 2:27)</span></a></span> may abide in us.
