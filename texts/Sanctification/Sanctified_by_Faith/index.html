<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.

For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Sanctification is a redemption blessing offered to us upon specified conditions. The natural and general blessings of God toward men, such as the sunshine, rain, and all other temporal or earthly blessings, may be received alike by both saint and sinner, who come into conformity with the natural laws by which these natural blessings are governed. Every redemption or spiritual blessing is also governed by divinely fixed laws, which if complied with will invariably bring to us all that is contained in the promise. God is able to bestow upon us these blessings unconditionally if this should be His sovereign will in some individual instances; but according to His redemption plan there is no assurance given to anyone for any of these specified blessings without a strict conformity to divine law. The word of God plainly sets forth the laws upon which these different redemption blessings are based. Repentance and faith are the laws of justification. It is a divinely established fact that God cannot lie. He has forever settled His word in heaven and also upon earth; therefore, it is impossible that any sinner should comply with the laws of repentance and faith and not be justified. Consecration and faith are the laws of sanctification, which if complied with, must necessarily bring us into this glorious soul-rest.</p>

<p>We have considered the law of consecration as a condition of sanctification in a previous chapter; and from the quoted texts in this chapter we will now briefly consider the law of faith. These laws are definitely fixed, and must as definitely be complied with. A definite consecration and a definite faith will produce a definite experience. One great lack in the church today is a lack of definiteness. The doctrine of sanctification must be more definitely taught by God&#8217;s anointed ministry, who have themselves definitely met the conditions, both to obtain and retain this definite experience. When it is definitely taught it will consequently be definitely sought and obtained.</p>

<p>In the apostle&#8217;s commission we distinctly see that we <span class="scripture">&#8220;are sanctified by faith.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+26%3A18" title="Acts 26:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 26:18)</span></a></span> We also see that Jesus suffered on the cross <span class="scripture">&#8220;that he might sanctify [us] with his own blood.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+13%3A12" title="Hebrews 13:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 13:12)</span></a></span> This points us to the fact that we must have faith in His blood. This grace is purchased for us, and now it is for us to receive it. We also see that He has made provision in this same purchase that we may be kept sanctified. This is upon the simple condition of walking in the light as He is in the light. The result of which is that his blood <span class="scripture">&#8220;cleanseth us from all sin.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1%3A7" title="I&nbsp;John 1:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 1:7)</span></a></span> These precious truths will do us no good if we do not believe them. No heart can ever receive the benefits of this inestimable purchase without faith. Faith is the hand that reaches out and takes it. Jesus can do no more than He has done to bring it to us. He holds it out to us, all perfect and complete, and as we meet the conditions of consecration and faith it becomes ours.</p>

<p>The apostle teaches us to reckon ourselves <span class="scripture">&#8220;dead indeed unto sin.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+6%3A11" title="Romans 6:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 6:11)</span></a></span> This can be done only by faith. The reckoning of faith is a very simple process; it is just believing God. Abraham believed God, simply reckoned that what God said was true, and then God counted something to Abraham. <span class="scripture">&#8220;He counted it to him for righteousness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+15%3A6" title="Genesis 15:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 15:6)</span></a></span></p>

<p>This is the divine law of faith. When we believe it is so because God says it, then God makes it so because we believe it. This law applies to all the graces of the gospel alike. It is a sad fact that some professing Christians do not believe we can be sanctified in this life. Now, it is utterly impossible for such people to get it. They do not believe. The blood of Christ cannot sanctify them in this condition. It is not for them at all. It is only for them that believe, and of course no one can believe for it in the scriptural sense without having met the condition of scriptural consecration. Then the scriptural reckoning will bring the scriptural and satisfactory result.</p>

<p>Let us illustrate with a simple mathematical reckoning. In a case of addition we take two numbers and reckon them together before we get the sum. It can never be obtained any other way. The two numbers are entirely distinct and separate from each other until they are reckoned together. It is the reckoning that produces the sum. This is exactly true in the process of faith. The justified believer comes to God for his inheritance of sanctification. He makes the absolute and definite consecration. He sees that the blood of Jesus has been shed that he may be sanctified. This is Jesus&#8217; part. The consecration is the believer&#8217;s part. There are the two separate parts which, if they are not reckoned together, will never produce the result. We might say that we have now made the consecration, and can do no more. This would be a mistake, we can do more: we have not yet done the reckoning. We can take the two parts, the blood of Jesus and our consecration, and by faith add them together, and according to the immutable law of God, which is the law of faith, the sum of the reckoning is, our sanctification. This is the scriptural method of obtaining this experience; and as we from henceforth reckon ourselves dead indeed unto sin upon the condition of an absolute, unbroken consecration, we may rest assured that the blood of Jesus keeps us cleansed from all sin. Someone may say he does not believe we can be kept free from sin, but such by no means affects this divine law. It is as true as heaven, despite all the unbelief of men. Oh, the power of the sin-cleansing blood! Can we not say with deep, heartfelt reality,</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Hallelujah for the cleansing;
<br />It has reached my inmost soul&#8221;?</p>

<p>Truly it is the sweet soul-rest, the heavenly Canaan of the soul, which is the inheritance of the people of God.</p>

<p>The apostle Peter, in his testimony of the inwrought grace of God at Pentecost, speaks of this law of faith, which effected in him and his brethren at Jerusalem, as well as the household of Cornelius upon the event of their induction into this glorious grace, the experience of heart purity, <span class="scripture">&#8220;and put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+15%3A9" title="Acts 15:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 15:9)</span></a></span> This is one phase of sanctification, and according to the testimony of Peter, was a part of the pentecostal experience. The other phase of it is, in the previous verse of this testimony, <span class="scripture">&#8220;giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+15%3A8" title="Acts 15:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 15:8)</span></a></span> This is explained by the apostle Paul. <span class="scripture">&#8220;That we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+3%3A14" title="Galatians 3:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 3:14)</span></a></span> In Romans, again we see that we are <span class="scripture">&#8220;sanctified by the Holy Ghost.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+15%3A16" title="Romans 15:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 15:16)</span></a></span> Certainly it could not be made more plain than these scriptures set it forth. We receive the pure heart and the Holy Spirit by faith, which experience is scripturally termed sanctification; therefore, we can understand the language of Jesus in that part of the commission of the apostle already quoted: <span class="scripture">&#8220;and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+26%3A18" title="Acts 26:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 26:18)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Dear brother and sister, let us magnify God and the name of Jesus for our inheritance, and if there should be one reader who has not yet entered into this promised land, let us go over at once and possess it.</p>

<p>We see a beautiful example of faith in the experience of the children of Abraham crossing the Jordan to enter into their literal inheritance. The priests that bore the ark, which went before the people, were to be the first to go down into the stream, which, God had said, should be divided, and the people should go over into their inheritance. As they came down to the river, their feet were dipped into the stream before the waters parted. God had promised it. They believed it and obeyed accordingly, and God fulfilled His promise; the waters were parted, and they all passed over. How different this was from those who, forty years previous to this event had been brought by the hand of God to Kadesh Barnea, who had all the promises of God in their favor, that He would cause them to go in and possess the land. But because of unbelief they were sent back into the wilderness, to wander and die. This literal Canaan was their promised land, their land of rest, their very own; God had promised Abraham that it should be possessed by his seed. But these forfeited it because of unbelief. This was the type of this spiritual inheritance of sanctification, our land of rest, our very own, which we, the spiritual seed of Abraham through faith in Christ, are to go into and possess.</p>

<p>The apostle gives us some wholesome admonition upon the importance of seeking to enter in. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+3%3A4" title="Hebrews 3:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 3:4)</span></a></span> An evil heart of unbelief will most certainly cause us to lose our inheritance. We are made partakers of it only by faith. As certainly as the unbelief of literal children of Abraham caused them to be rejected and disinherited, so will unbelief cause the same sad result in losing the spiritual inheritance. They provoked God with their unbelief, and He who had sworn to Abraham that his seed should possess Canaan, now sware that these unbelieving ones should not enter in. They could not enter in because of unbelief. God&#8217;s word was not broken, however; for He brought into this land those of the children who, their unbelieving fathers said, would become a prey to the inhabitants of the land. And what still keeps God&#8217;s word from being broken is that He has opened to us this glorious spiritual land, and tells us to go over and possess it. Dear brother, are you at Kadesh Barnea today, and afraid of the giants? God has given the land to us. The message of reproof comes to you with this solemn and important question, <span class="scripture">&#8220;How long are ye slack to go to possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers hath given you?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Joshua+18%3A3" title="Joshua 18:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Joshua 18:3)</span></a></span></p>

<p>This gospel of sanctification is preached to us today as the gospel of literal Canaan was preached to those descendants of Abraham in that day. It did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it. The apostle says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;We which have believed do enter into rest,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+3%3A4" title="Hebrews 3:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 3:4)</span></a></span> but more must enter in. God&#8217;s promise to Abraham must yet be more completely fulfilled. The question is simply left with us: Will we enter in or will we not? If we will not, then the inheritance will be given to others, and we will lose the blessed soul-rest that is provided in this redemption for the people of God. In his exhortation to us, the apostle says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A11" title="Hebrews 4:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 4:11)</span></a></span></p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Oh, this blessed, holy rest,
<br />On my Jesus&#8217; loving breast!
<br />Oh, the sweetness and completeness
<br />Of perfected holiness!&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Oh_This_Blessed_Holy_Rest/index.html" title="Oh, This Blessed Holy Rest">*</a></p>
