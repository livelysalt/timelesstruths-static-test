<p class="first">Note: We have often received different letters from sisters, sharing a burden the Lord had placed on them, sharing a lesson they had recently learned. These letters were very valuable to us&#8212;to get a chance to peek into the heart of another and to benefit and be encouraged to go on to higher grounds ourselves. We want to pass these letters on to you also, in hopes that they would encourage you as well.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Lorenz wrote us, sharing what God has put on her heart. In a separate letter, she writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">The Lord inspired me to share what He had laid upon my heart these past months, in the form of a letter&#8230;. I have very much been inspired by the life of Hudson Taylor, as well as the Apostle Paul, and though I am a woman, I feel He can use me to bring the gospel to others. (Whether married or single, I leave to His judgment, for He knows the limitations of a woman, and whether His ends be accomplished through me as a virgin or a helpmeet.)</p>

</blockquote>


<p>&#8230;&#8203;And if he Lord has laid a burden of some kind on any of the rest of your hearts, or if there is something you feel led to share, please write.</p>

<h1>Prepare Today for the Long Tomorrow</h1>

<h2 class="subtitle">What on earth are you doing for heaven&#8217;s sake?</h2>
<p class="author">Elizabeth Lorenz</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>The Lord has, this past year, placed something heavily upon my heart, and I feel His prompting to share it with you all. My life, at this time, is filled with uncertainties, and my walk is by faith and trust&#8230;&#8203;and yet, I have a vision that has been following me through my days, that will not go away and ever grows brighter! This is not a mere ideal, but a true burden, one that has called me to surrender my own ideas, dreams, comforts, and even life, into the Hands I love so well. I am seeking not to live for earth alone, but for eternity.</p>

<p>Looking about me, I see many people in the world devoting their whole lives to earthly things: art, music, literature, science, acting&#8230;&#8203;the list is endless. They sacrifice all things for this one passion, they eat and sleep and breathe for it&#8230;&#8203;and yet, when they die, it does, too! They most certainly cannot take their paintings and scientific discoveries with them into the next life. The things of this world shall pass away, but the soul shall live forever, whether in eternal bliss or torment depends on their choice while still here. Oh, my sisters, this is so important! How many people do we daily meet that have no hope of heaven? As Christians, do we truly care about the eternal souls of others, or are we too occupied with our own &#8220;living for the Lord.&#8221; Yes, even when trying to live for Jesus, we may be buried in our own selfishness. I know that I was, and to some extent I still am. So often we don&#8217;t even recognize it!</p>

<p>We are called, as Christians, to be separate from the world. How is this to be done? Some have tried to physically separate themselves by living away from cities (usually the centers of ungodliness), and lead quiet lives in the country, or even in their own Christian Communities. Perhaps they are able to still bring the Good News to others who have not heard. For my part, I feel the separation is more of an emotionally letting go of the things which are not pleasing to God or take our focus off Him. And, of course, obedience to the Word in areas such as dress, education, and relationships, will certainly mark us as peculiar! However, often with our convictions comes pride. We soon feel it is our duty to separate ourselves from those who do not dress as we do or perhaps choose to date rather than heed the principles of courtship. This, my sisters, is wrong! Yes, we must uphold our convictions, and cling to them lest the Enemy persuade us to give them up, but let them not dwell in the forefronts of our minds.</p>

<p>When people look at us, do we want them to see, &#8220;I am holy!&#8221; or &#8220;I love Christ, and I also love you!&#8221;? Love, the first commandment of our Lord. When we look upon another Christian, even if he or she does not have the same standards as we have, let us think, &#8220;another washed in the life-blood of Christ!&#8221; and be truly glad to see them. [Not condemn them, but rather pray that the Lord would open their eyes if there are biblical standards that they do not see.] And when we meet those who dwell in darkness, let us look at their soul, so black, in need of Jesus, doomed to die forever! My sister, this is the burden of my heart. Should I be content with  the occasional meeting with an unbeliever, the occasional chance to witness, or should I devote my whole life to bringing them the gospel? People have given their lives for much lesser things. How many men have given their lives for liberty? If only the same passion and devotion were given to sharing the gospel! Eternity is a long time.</p>

<p>My dear sisters, I have no practical ideas on how to devote my life to missionary work. But I am trusting my Lord to work all things according to His Will. To say I am willing is no little thing, for already I have had to emotionally give up the comforts of a self-pleasing life. The vision is ever before me, and at times, I see how God is working to bring it about. I, in the mean time, the waiting time&#8212;I am giving myself to my family&#8230;&#8203;and the few people God brings into my life to minister to. No doubt, if I prove faithful in the little He gives me, He will give me more and more. The love of Christ is my reward. How sweet, how real it is!</p>

<p class="signature">Blessings to you all,<br />Elizabeth Lorenz<br />Tehachapi, CA</p>
