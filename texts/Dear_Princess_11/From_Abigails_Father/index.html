<h1>From Abigail&#8217;s Father</h1>

<p>Several years ago, when Abigail began to express her burden for publishing a paper for young ladies, her mother and I prayed about it and felt that it would be a good thing. We were aware of some of the hazards that can come to a young person as a result of exposure in this way, but also knew that the Lord could keep and sustain if she would trust Him. If the thing was of the Lord, it would be to her spiritual profit and to others as well. We were also aware of the solemn responsibility that comes with any kind of leadership position&#8212;the serious and weighty possibility of bringing a reproach which would hinder others.</p>

<p>It was a young person&#8217;s paper, and it was expected that they would make the mistakes that young people make and hopefully learn from them. We regarded it as our responsibility to exercise a certain oversight and to provide certain directions which she could not be expected to grasp at this time in her life. Within that area, we left a great deal up to her, knowing that she must seek the Lord herself if the paper was to be spiritual. We remained watchful and on watch in our place and were gratified and thankful to see some spiritual progress on her part.</p>

<p>When Skye was invited by Abigail to coedit, this responsibility for oversight was shared by her Uncle and Aunt (with whom she resides). The Lord has helped us. We have always felt that if each child of God will live close to the Lord and be directed by Him, He is able and so willing to help us to live in unity, each to the point of speaking the same thing and having the same judgment (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+1%3A10">I&nbsp;Corinthians 1:10</a>). We trust God to help us to live to this Bible standard, readily recognizing that it is impossible without a purified heart and the assistance and direction of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>The teenage years are the most unsettled periods of our lives, and an effort such as <i>Dear Princess</i> raises all kinds of questions and provides generous portions of challenge for good parental government. It seems best to the adults involved to merge the magazine with a family publication that the Lord has burdened us to print. Therefore this is the last &#8220;stand-alone&#8221; issue of <i>Dear Princess</i>.</p>

<p>The Lord has convicted us that He wants us to print a family paper, <i>Foundation Truth</i>. Brother Rick Erickson will be editing the paper while the rest of us will contribute and help. The <i>Dear Princess</i> paper will be part of this family paper. It is anticipated to include a Bible discussion feature as well as a section devoted to issues of special interest to young men. We hope to begin work on the first issue after the last issue of <i>Dear Princess</i> is mailed, and to publish it as soon as we can. Terms of subscription are exactly the same as <i>Dear Princess</i>; upon receiving your first issue, you must let us know whether you wish to continue, and you must let us know each year whether you still wish to receive the publication. There is no subscription price, as the means to print the paper are supplied through faith in God.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalms+127%3A1" title="Psalms 127:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalms 127:1)</span></a></span> We are looking to God for help to be able to do good with this effort. We certainly do not want to do you any harm. Please pray for us.</p>

<p>We love the Lord and want to please Him, and we love you, too. If we can be of service to you by personal correspondence or telephone, please feel free to contact us. </p>
