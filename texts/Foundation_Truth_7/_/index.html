<h1>Living by Faith</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Readers,</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Now the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will shew thee: And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. So Abram departed, as the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+12%3A1-4" title="Genesis 12:1-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 12:1-4)</span></a></span></p>

<p>That&#8217;s what the Bible says. But for those who lived around Abram right then, I doubt very much that those thoughts came naturally to mind. Let&#8217;s imagine for a moment, shall we? Several neighbors are visiting, and Abram&#8217;s &#8220;case&#8221; is brought up:</p>

<p>Javan: &#8220;What a sad waste. I heard that he had some kind of vision or something, that he was supposed to leave, without any clear destination, and that he would become a great nation! He seemed like he had some leadership potential, and he could have amounted to something if he stayed around here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barak: &#8220;Great nation, hah! He and that barren wife of his. All that roaming around, with no settled home, isn&#8217;t likely to improve matters much, either. He&#8217;ll do well to survive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beor: &#8220;Good riddance, I&#8217;d say! His narrow-minded, &#8216;One God&#8217; ways aren&#8217;t wanted around here, anyway. It looks like most of the family feel the same. I hear that only his nephew, Lot, is joining him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Living by faith is different than natural life. It&#8217;s so simple and obvious, yet it bears repeating: Living by faith is different than natural life. You are building on truths that are discerned through communication with heaven, not earth. If Abram folllowed the wisdom of earth, he would nevver have become Abraham, the father of the faithful. Imagine how the story of Christian in Pilgrm&#8217;s Progress would have turned out if he had not plugged his ears to the cries of family, friends, and neightbors, and ran on, crying, &#8220;Life, life, eternal life!&#8221;</p>

<p>Living by faith is also living as a child, without being childish. That is to say, it is a life that calles us to deny ourselves, take on responsibilities, and yet always be a trusting and obedient child in our Fatheer&#8217;s houres.</p>

<p>Jesus said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+4%3A19" title="Matthew 4:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 4:19)</span></a></span> He said that to fishermen. He didn&#8217;t tell them that he wanted them to start directing the skills they had as fishermen to the glory of God, and he didn&#8217;t tell them to sit back and review all the principles that they had learned about fishing, and apply them now to preaching the Kingdom of God&#8212;he said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Follow me.&#8221;</span> Their part was to follow Jesss. It was Jesss&#8217; part to make them <span class="scripture">&#8220;fishers of men.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Abram&#8217;s part was to leave Haran and follow the Lord to the land that He would show him. It was God&#8217;s part to make a great nation out of him, and make him a blessing to all the families of the earth.</p>

<p>The life of faith is a life of responsibilities, but it is the responsibilities of a child in his Father&#8217;s House. We need to take on our part, and leave the rest to the Lord.</p>

<h1>A Second Cleansing?</h1>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">Questions regarding sanctification as a second work of grace from one of our readers.</p>
</div>


<hr class="minor" />
<p>This letter was received from one of our readers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">This is in regards to a letter submitted in the young ladies&#8217; section of the magazine. It was written by a young lady sharing of her search for &#8220;sanctification.&#8221; I want to keep this as brief as I can. My heart was so troubled as I read of this poor girl searching for something to complete her Christian experience. It saddens us all so deeply that you encourage the teaching that Christians must come to this &#8220;second work of grace&#8221; to completely be set free from the power of sin. The literature you offer even said that the blood of Christ has to be applied twice to make one accepted of God! To get that from the Word of God one must consistently take things out of context and bend them to fit your view. What that young girl needed was only to recognize what it was she already had in the Person of Jesus Christ (if she was indeed born again). Please see
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+1%3A31">I Corinthians 1:31</a>.
It was not another &#8220;experience&#8221; she needed. Perhaps when she first accepted the Lord it was not explained to her (or she was not of an age that she could understand) what it was that she was entering into to become a Christian, and as she got older she realized she did not commit herself as she should have. Maybe she had only met the babe in the manger rather than the Christ of the Cross.</p>

<p>I do not want to belabor this point. My husband has tried to converse with yours concerning this issue and after sending two letters with specific questions (the first letter was lost so he sent again) and receiving no response he has come to the conclusion your husband does not want to answer his questions. My husband also sent a letter to Mr. Erickson after he read another article in the magazine. He again has gotten no response.</p>

<p>Again, there are many things we do enjoy in your magazine, but teaching &#8220;sanctification&#8221; as you do and promoting it as something every believer must experience keeps us from enjoying the rest of the magazine as we would like to. We do rejoice that our end goals seem to be the same. That is, living a life in total submission to the will of God in our lives and being willing to being conformed to the image of His dear Son.</p>

</blockquote>


<p class="noindent">Dear Readers,</p>

<p>There is a second cleansing for believers who have received a first cleansing.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; <b>that he might sanctify and cleanse it</b> with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A25-27" title="Ephesians 5:25-27"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 5:25-27)</span></a></span>
People get into God&#8217;s church by being saved (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+2%3A47%3B+Psalms+87%3A5%3B+Hebrews+12%3A23">Acts 2:47; Psalms 87:5; Hebrews 12:23</a>).
The blood is applied to translate them from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of His dear Son.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+5%3A1" title="Romans 5:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 5:1)</span></a></span>
All committed sins are washed away by the blood of our Atonement.</p>

<p>But, as is plain from the text quoted above in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A25-27">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>,
there is a cleansing for the church. A cleansing from what? Not from sins that we committed, for they were washed away and removed as far as the east is from the west, to be remembered no more. How blessed to be in the position of just persons that need no repentance! But why is there a need for cleansing if our sins which we committed have already been cleansed? (Some might think that Christians keep on sinning and repenting. Read
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+3%3A6%2C+9-10">I&nbsp;John 3:6, 9-10</a>:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Whosoever abideth in Him sinneth not&#8230;. In this the children of God are manifest.&#8221;</span>
God gives power to live a life of victory over sin when He saves the soul.
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+1%3A12">John 1:12</a>.)
</p>

<p>That there is a second cleansing is clear from the experience of the apostles.
Before Pentecost, they were saved men with their names written in heaven (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+10%3A20">Luke 10:20</a>).
In the
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+15">15th chapter of John</a>,
Jesus acknowledged that they were clean, but told them that He had a purging for them. By reading the testimony of Peter in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+15%3A8-9">Acts 15:8-9</a>,
we find that he knew that he had his heart purified when he received the Holy Ghost, and that he recognized that the devout brother Cornelius and others of his household had their hearts purified when the Holy Ghost came upon them.</p>

<p>The entire New Testament is crowded from start to finish with scriptures that teach that God has something deeper, something of a fundamental change in nature <b>for the believer</b>
(<span class="scripture">&#8220;Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+19%3A2" title="Acts 19:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 19:2)</span></a></span>).
That the blood is re-applied by faith for a different kind of cleansing&#8212;a reality which one cannot grasp if one is not living a saved life. That the Spirit of God leads every child of God into the deeper experience. Where is the scriptural proof for re-application of the blood of Jesus?
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Having therefore, <b>brethren</b>, boldness to <b>enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus</b>.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A19" title="Hebrews 10:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 10:19)</span></a></span>
Note that this way is made for brethren. The holiest is accessible only through the holy place, which was in turn only accessible through the sacrifice made on the great brazen altar outside and the cleansing laver. Note also that the same blood spilled on that altar was carried by the priest into the holiest of all. How beautifully this harmonizes with the scriptural teaching quoted above!</p>

<p>A great deal more could be said here. For as stated above, the New Testament states this basic truth over and over. The brethren of the early morning church experienced the grace of God in two works and taught and urged all who would toward a state of Christian perfection, i.e., completeness, perfect love, entire sanctification, etc.</p>

<p>Man has two kinds of sin in the unregenerated state. He was born with a defiled nature&#8212;an inherited nature of sin which he is not personally responsible for. It cannot be repented of, for the individual possessing the defiled nature did nothing to acquire it. When an individual is in a state of condemnation before God because of wilful transgression, the defiled nature is eclipsed by the awful, scathing knowledge of committed sins. When these are forgiven and washed away by the precious blood of the Redeemer, then and then only can the Spirit of God lead into all truth, including the awful fact that a redeemed and born again soul yet has another need of cleansing.</p>

<p>But why does not God do it all at once? For the same reason that repentance and faith in the blood are required to find a cleansing from committed sins. A walk with God starts with a voluntary choice on the part of the one receiving help, and each subsequent step is a voluntary choice as well. In other words, God yokes himself to our ability to comprehend our need sufficient to exercise faith in Him for help. It is not lack of ability on God&#8217;s part at all, but on our part to grasp.</p>

<p>Our correspondent is much grieved that we thus teach this two-fold plan that God made for us. &#8220;To get that from the Word of God one must consistently take things out of context and bend them to fit your view.&#8221; We must differ. Consider the matter; we beg of you. Do you deny that the disciples were saved when they were casting out devils and healing the sick? Do you deny that they had undergone a cleansing to do the work of God? Do you deny that they sought and found a subsequent cleansing at the day of Pentecost? That Jesus purges those branches that are in Him? That the two rooms of the Old Testament tabernacle were representative of the two works of grace for every child of God? Do you believe that the Bible teaches two different kinds of sin? Do you deny the existence of depravity (inherited sin)? Surely it is evident that you must either, (1) believe that it can be removed in this life, or (2) believe that it cannot be removed. If you believe it can be removed, then (1) you believe it is removed when one is forgiven, or (2) you believe it is removed subsequently. What are the conditions for removal which God has laid down? When is it possible to grasp those conditions and find the work done?</p>

<p>Now we pose these questions to expose the issues at stake. Each one has a scriptural answer. (This list of scriptural references is by no means exhaustive.) If you deny the existence of depravity, see
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+5%3A14%3B+Genesis+5%3A1%2C3">Romans 5:14; Genesis 5:1,3</a>.
If you believe in the existence of depravity, but doubt it can be removed, then I would recommend to you the
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+4">fourth chapter of Hebrews</a>.
Note that this chapter is addressed to holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling. Here is presented the justified state as a wilderness experience (after escape from Egypt&#8212;sin&#8212;by immersion in the Red Sea) and Canaan (the promised land) is presented as a place of perfect rest in God. These holy brethren were urged to enter in God&#8217;s rest by faith and warned against doubting that God would help them to possess the land.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Let us therefore fear, lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A1" title="Hebrews 4:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 4:1)</span></a></span>
The fulfillment of that seeking is found when
<span class="scripture">&#8220;he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A10" title="Hebrews 4:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 4:10)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;They which live should not henceforth live unto themselves.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+5%3A15" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 5:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 5:15)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+2%3A20" title="Galatians 2:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 2:20)</span></a></span>
Here is taught and testified a perfect rest in Christ in this life, wherein
<span class="scripture">&#8220;he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works.&#8221;</span>
</p>

<p>I am well aware that many doubt that this kind of walk is possible in this life, but I assert that it is not only possible, but is our heritage, being willed to us by our Older Brother, who opened a new and living way within the veil for us.</p>

<p>The young sister who sought these things from the Lord testified for herself in detail, but I am certainly willing to say that I had confidence in her walk with God before she was entirely sanctified, and I have seen a distinct change in her, right along these Bible lines, since she received the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Now we are glad that our correspondent and her husband wants to live &#8220;a life in total submission to the will of God,&#8221; and is willing to be &#8220;conformed to the image of His dear Son.&#8221; And we have not the slightest doubt, that, if they will let the Lord have His way, He will lead them to a scriptural understanding of this work and establish them unblameable in holiness (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+3%3A13">I&nbsp;Thessalonians 3:13</a>).</p>

<p>It has been my experience that we do not suspect the reality and the depth of the old nature inherited from Adam within us until the Holy Spirit deals with our heart and thoroughly convinces us. There is little use to discuss matters with someone who has not yet been dealt with by the Holy Spirit in the matter under consideration. (How far do you think you would have gotten with Peter in persuading him that he would deny the Lord? He wouldn&#8217;t even listen to Jesus at that time.) This would do no good, and it could hinder. We certainly do not want to get ahead of the Lord. This is true where folks are honest and truly being lead by the Lord. Where there is another influence at work, it is just as necessary to stay in order of the Lord.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A24-25" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 2:24-25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 2:24-25)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Regardless of what people believe, reality is reality. The inherited nature is real. Deliverance from it is real.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherefore Jesus, also, that He might sanctify the people with His own blood, suffered without the gate.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+13%3A12" title="Hebrews 13:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 13:12)</span></a></span></p>

<h1>The Work of the Holy Spirit</h1>

<p>The Holy Spirit is not an aggressive, overbearing presence at all, but is quiet and gentle. He knocks, woos, and persuades all who will listen to His still, quiet voice. His persistence in drawing men to Christ is beyond the power of human speech to portray. From the first realization of sin to the end of our time of probation, He deals with and pricks the heart, reproves the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.</p>

<p>He will withdraw if resisted or ignored, and He can be grieved with the response (or lack thereof) of an individual to the extent that He will stop dealing with that person. If this happens, the doom of that person is certain,
for no man can come unto Jesus except the Father draw him (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+6%3A44">John 6:44</a>),
and God does this through the working of the Holy Spirit.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+4%3A30" title="Ephesians 4:30"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 4:30)</span></a></span>
This is a terrible condition, indeed; although many have probably concluded that this was their condition, and that there was no hope for them, when actually they had caused the Spirit of God to withdraw from them for a season.</p>

<p>How important it is to be sensitive to the dealings of the Holy Spirit! I am persuaded that the enemy of our soul works very hard indeed to induce those who love the Lord to be careless and insensitive to the leadings of the Gentle Spirit. A little stiffness and slowness to humble down, a preoccupation with some distraction, and the voice of our Guide is missed, and thus the children of God make mistakes and the devil gains an advantage over them. It is not that the heart motive is wrong, or that willful transgression is given a place in the soul. It is the same as when one of two humans who love each other fails to listen and understand the other, and so friction enters into the relationship, along with bearing and forbearing, and the potential for problems.</p>

<p>It takes a close and humble walk for a soul to stay right in step with God, and one can walk with the Lord for quite a ways without the keenness and sensitivity of the first love and without giving way to rebellion and breaking fellowship with the Lord. Such is a condition of leanness and is very dangerous and easily leads once more to sin.</p>

<p>It is the most natural and normal thing in the world, when a soul has truly repented and been down to the depths of Bible
&#8220;carefulness&#8221; and &#8220;clearing of themselves&#8221; (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+7%3A11">II&nbsp;Corinthians 7:11</a>),
for the humbled and forgiven heart to look for guidance and instruction from above. The inability of the heart to direct the steps is a proven matter, fresh and poignant. The acknowledgment of failure hushes and subdues the soul. Having tried one&#8217;s own way and having made a miserable mess of it, there is now a great desire to be guided and taught of God. In short, the first steps have been taken in living for God, instead of self. The same Spirit of God that first drew us to a reconciliation with God through His dear Son is there to lead the newly-saved soul to a more comprehensive consecration and a definite experience which is described in the Bible as a
baptism of the Holy Ghost (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+1%3A5">Acts 1:5</a>),
a
coming upon you of the Holy Ghost (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+1%3A8">Acts 1:8</a>),
the giving of another Comforter&#8212;besides Jesus&#8212;even the Spirit of truth, a 
sealing of that Holy Spirit of promise (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+1%3A13">Ephesians 1:13</a>),
etc. He is <i>with</i> the justified believer, and is
<i>in</i> the sanctified believer (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+14%3A17">John 14:17</a>).
In all this, there is sound hope of a better future, for the man has surrendered to God, and God is able to take that first surrender and
<span class="scripture">&#8220;do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think, <b>according to the power that worketh in us.</b>&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+3%3A20" title="Ephesians 3:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 3:20)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+3%3A16" title="Ephesians 3:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 3:16)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;<b>Tarry ye</b> in the city of Jerusalem, <b>until ye be endued</b> with power from on high.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+24%3A49" title="Luke 24:49"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 24:49)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>It is the immediate focal point of the Holy Spirit in the life of the newly-saved to lead to an absolute surrender and an infilling. There is a needed purging from inward depravity that is absolutely necessary if the soul is to be established unblameable in holiness. And now, since the forgiven soul is washed from his iniquity, and peace with God is the happy result, there is a real need to voluntarily and whole-heartedly offer back to the Lord the good things which He has given. When in sin, we have nothing to offer God but a ruined and blasted life, defiled and shameful, but since He forgave us and washed us from our sins in His own blood, we have what He gave us in the washing of regeneration to give back to Him. Accordingly we read that we can now present our bodies
<span class="scripture">&#8220;a living sacrifice, <b>holy, acceptable unto God,</b> which is your reasonable service.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+12%3A1" title="Romans 12:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 12:1)</span></a></span>
This was not possible when we came to God for forgiveness from sin, for then we did not possess a holy, acceptable-unto-God sacrifice.</p>

<p>And so we find that the Holy Spirit leads unerringly to an upper-room experience which is followed by a Pentecostal infilling.</p>

<p>It is this absolute consecration and complete infilling which is so necessary to walk with God, both at the individual level and at the congregational level. We observe the happy result of individuals filled with the Spirit comprising congregations filled with the Holy Spirit in the record of the New Testament.
It was and is a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A27">Ephesians 5:27</a>).
It fulfilled perfectly
the prophecy of a kingdom cut out of a mountain <b>without hands</b> (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Daniel+2%3A34%2C44">Daniel 2:34,44</a>),
a kingdom set up by the God of heaven, <b>which shall not be left to other people.</b> It was not left to other people because it is governed by God Himself.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+12%3A18" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 12:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 12:18)</span></a></span>
And this is done through the agency of the Holy Spirit working in each member&#8217;s life.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;All these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+12%3A11" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 12:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 12:11)</span></a></span>
The wonderful unity and glorious power that we read of in the New Testament came because
<span class="scripture">&#8220;we&#8230;&#8203;have been all made to drink into one Spirit.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+12%3A13" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 12:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 12:13)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>We observe that because men surrendered absolutely to the Holy Spirit, He set them in the body and kept them in their God-appointed place. The Holy Spirit did that then, and He will do that now. He is ready, willing, and able. If we will let Him, He will produce exactly the same result today.</p>

<p>Every historical blessing of true unity and power has come about in this way. Nor can it come any other way. For this is how God does it. He starts at the individual level. If God can get a number of individuals wholly consecrated and filled with the Holy Ghost, He will have a congregation wholly consecrated and filled. If He can lead an individual because that individual has surrendered absolutely and has been filled, then He can guide and govern a collective group of those individuals.</p>

<p>
Most of the people who have started out for God have not gone on to Christian perfection (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+6%3A1%3B+2+Corinthians+13%3A9%3B+Luke+8%3A14">Hebrews 6:1; II&nbsp;Corinthians 13:9; Luke 8:14</a>).
This is not because they willingly drew back in the majority of cases, we are persuaded; but because the adversary effectively hides the truth from their eyes in spite of the dealings of the Holy Spirit. Or makes it fuzzy and indistinct to the extent that they are unable to get a hold of it. God knew that we needed a full salvation, and the devil knows we need it, too.</p>

<p>The lack of supreme consecration and Holy Spirit purging in the heart is at the bottom of all the divisions between those who profess to love God. It is accountable for the &#8220;I think&#8221; spirit, for the debating and strife that is so disgusting and discouraging. The unpurged carnality of men&#8217;s hearts prompts them to hero worship, to heights of ambition, to fair shows in the flesh. It holds men&#8217;s person in admiration because of advantage.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+3%3A15-16" title="James 3:15-16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 3:15-16)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Now God has something for His little children. He has a work, even the work of the Holy Ghost, which will change you and your outlook.
It purifies the heart and anoints the eyes so that you can see God (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+5%3A8%3B+Revelations+3%3A18%3B+Proverbs+29%3A18">Matthew 5:8; Revelations 3:18; Proverbs 29:18</a>).
It will enable you to trust God completely with a perfected trust, even as the brethren of the New Testament church rested and relied upon God. How vital to be able to do so! God wants you to hear the quiet, still voice of the Holy Spirit, to distinguish it from all other voices, and to obey willingly and wholeheartedly. You can see all things working together for your good and the good of others who love God. You can find that you work your trials, rather than your trials working you. Dear children of God, you need and must have a Canaan experience. To be workers together with God, you must have it. You will get out of harmony, out of synchronization with God, if you attempt to live for God without it.</p>

<p>In the
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Samuel+6">sixth chapter of II&nbsp;Samuel</a>, we read of the error of Uzzah. He <i>meant</i> well, for the ark of God was shaking as the oxen drew it. He was afraid for the ark and felt compelled to take action. How common is Perezuzzah (&#8220;The breach of Uzzah&#8221;)! Men build their systems (&#8220;for God&#8221;); they promulgate their creeds (&#8220;for God&#8221;); they discipline themselves (&#8220;for God&#8221;). It is not done right. The oxen were not supposed to move the ark. Men overreach themselves and usurp the place of the Holy Spirit in the work of God. They labor and sacrifice (&#8220;for God&#8221;); they exert themselves; but it is <i>for</i> God, not <i>of</i> Him.</p>

<p>We could fill a book with what we have seen of men laying hands on the ark and the fatal results. We have seen it done over and over. At great cost, we fled a group of people among whom we had labored for years, to keep clear with God on this point of laying hands on the ark. We have prayed earnestly (and continue to pray earnestly) that God will help us not to do it. Oh, to stay in the order of God! To neither be a lord over God&#8217;s heritage or an unfaithful hireling! We want to meet Jesus with a clear conscience and an acceptable record. To be clear from the blood of all men (having not shunned to declare the whole counsel of God) and to be abusive to none! To abhor fleshly wisdom&#8212;rather to exercise the wisdom that cometh from above. For
<span class="scripture">&#8220;the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+3%3A17" title="James 3:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 3:17)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>The definite infilling of the Holy Ghost was one of the great truths which was lost in the enormous apostasy of the third century. It was not rediscovered and taught in a general sense until the seventeen hundreds. Even then, men were hindered from obtaining the experience; for the Bible teaching on this point was discovered by men who already were under the influence of an idol. Perfect consecration to God means the breaking of every other yoke, and attempts to hold and teach the experience were frustrated by the inherent contradiction in being part of something that was the work of men&#8217;s hands, yet consecrating to be all the Lord&#8217;s without reservation. Yet individuals pressed forward and found the experience of perfect love, and so occurred the holiness agitation of the following century which resulted in a group of people who took a stand consistent with <b>total loyalty to God,</b> whatever the cost. They taught a coming out of everything not of God, and paid the price to do so. They were greatly blessed of God in precisely the same way and to the same degree as the New Testament church back in the first 270 years or so of Christianity.</p>

<p>What does it mean to be totally loyal to God, whatever the cost? First, there is an unquenchable desire to know what is right. This is rare, sad to say. Most folks are like children who don&#8217;t want to hear Mother or Father clearly. If they don&#8217;t hear it clearly, then they can do as they please. &#8220;I <i>didn&#8217;t</i> hear you calling me, Mother.&#8221; (I didn&#8217;t <i>want</i> to hear you calling me&#8230;.) But those who are truly Christ&#8217;s, they <i>want</i> to hear; they <i>want</i> to know. They want to be as sure as possible that they are really pleasing God, and they will pursue a matter to the <i>nth</i> degree to make certain that they are walking unto all pleasing. No price is too great to buy the truth. Everything else is esteemed as worthless.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+3%3A8" title="Philippians 3:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 3:8)</span></a></span>
Secondly, there is a doing of what is known. The hunger to perform the Word of the Lord drives the thirst to know.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth. And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+3%3A18-19" title="I&nbsp;John 3:18-19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 3:18-19)</span></a></span>
Thirdly, there is a great thankfulness and gratitude to know the will of God which manifests itself in praise of Him and His wondrous ways. Fourthly, there is a great humbling of the soul, and a clear understanding that,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+17%3A10" title="Luke 17:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 17:10)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>A loss of this hunger and thirst for right-eousness will result in losing what is already possessed, whether this be at the individual level or a group of individuals. As one brother put it, &#8220;Brethren, we must love this truth. If we do not love this truth, we will lose it.&#8221; There must be a depth of sincerity, a disavowal of lip service and a form of godliness, a consecration, and a careful and wholehearted measuring to all divine leading to keep the truth and please the Lord. Read
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Thessalonians+2%3A10">II&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:10</a>.
At a glance, you can comprehend the awful result of not receiving a love for the truth. We will tell you in all love that it means a great deal to walk in the light as He is in the light. It is a great deal more than just a profession. How we would that all who &#8220;talked the talk&#8221; would &#8220;walk the walk&#8221;!</p>

<p>There is so much more to this matter than just making up your mind and setting your will. You can do that without the work of the Holy Ghost within you. Making up your mind and setting your will, in themselves, are necessary to do the works of man; but,
if you want to do the works of God (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+6%3A28">John 6:28</a>),
the work of God must be done in you first, in all its completeness. It takes all you can do, plus what God does in and through you, to work the works of God.</p>

<p>A man who has been purged by the Holy Spirit is crippled in his self-confidence and liberated in his confidence in God. They go together. It was a handicapped Jacob with a shrunken thigh, after wrestling with the angel all night, that went in the confidence that God would help him to meet Esau. Jacob was not a possessor of New Testament sanctification, but his experience was a shadow and type of what God does in the hearts of his children in this dispensation of the Holy Spirit. Please take note that he both obtained help and was disabled because he tarried.</p>

<p>I was raised by my parents to excel, to rise among men, to assume leadership, to exercise executive authority, to mastery; but God leveled this high-minded mountain to the plain of holiness. I died to all that, and the Spirit of God brought forth a headstone upon my living grave, 
<span class="scripture">&#8220;crying, Grace, grace unto it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Zechariah+4%3A7" title="Zechariah 4:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Zechariah 4:7)</span></a></span>
Yes, grace&#8212;the <i>unmerited</i> favor of God. That is all I have now, but it is sufficient; yea, more than sufficient. The whole experience leaves one with no confidence in the flesh. See
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+3%3A3-9">Philippians 3:3-9</a>.
After the flesh, I find myself at disadvantage in seeking a job, etc., but alive unto God through the Spirit. Yea,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+10%3A22" title="Proverbs 10:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 10:22)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>It is this experience&#8212;the purging, sanctifying fire of the Holy Ghost&#8212;that makes it possible for one to know how to behave ones self in the House of God. It is so totally different from how most people, including ministers, view religion and religious work.</p>

<p>It was this experience in the heart that produced the New Testament church we read about in the scriptures. The pages of the history of these brethren are full of exhortations, teachings, and warnings that all flow from the fullness of the Comforter in their hearts. There is a strong sense of an <b>ever-present Christ.</b> They saw Him and were governed by Him constantly, both individually and collectively, in an intimate way that is glaringly lacking in almost all of professed Christendom around us. <b>In the individual hearts and collective assemblies of the wholly sanctified, it is exactly the same today as it was back then.</b>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+18%3A20" title="Matthew 18:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 18:20)</span></a></span>
The government is still on His shoulder (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+9%3A6">Isaiah 9:6</a>).
Not only do we plainly see Jesus right now in the midst of His children in the year 2002, but every other aspect of the New Testament church matches as well. And one of the results of that identicalness is an <b>amazing relevance.</b> The New Testament (and the Old Testament in type and shadow) are so appropriate and fitting to us. Every detail is pertinent, incredibly so, considering the distance involved in the times and human thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;King Jehoshaphat and Ahab are moldering in their graves,&#8221; a brother said. &#8220;What do they have to do with us now, today?&#8221; The reply is:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+15%3A4" title="Romans 15:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 15:4)</span></a></span>
The problems of human nature in their many manifestations are the same today as they have been all down through the centuries. It is the work of the Holy Spirit to bring all who now will into the unity of the faith as God has established it all along.

that God&#8217;s people have already possessed. So that we can &#8220;fit in&#8221; with all the saints who have lived before us. How natural it seems to think of them as &#8220;Brother Paul&#8221; and &#8220;Brother Peter&#8221;! Members of the family. Those of the Old Testament dispensation as well as those of the new. &#8220;Brother Elijah,&#8221; &#8220;Brother David.&#8221; They walked in the light of their day and pleased God, according to their privileges.
How they wished to see the things that we are privileged to see! And now (in the glory world) they see and rejoice!

</p>

<p>There are many professed Christians and some possessing ones, too, who are doubtful and unseeing; who question and lament. They do not see the unity, the power, or the glory. It all seems
Ichabod (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Samuel+4%3A21">I&nbsp;Samuel 4:21</a>)
to them.</p>

<p>We wish to reply to you dear ones. We do not despise you.
You cannot see until God opens your eyes (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Kings+6%3A17">II&nbsp;Kings 6:17</a>).

do not despise the day of small things! (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Zechariah+4%3A10">Zechariah 4:10</a>).
God is still saving and sanctifying people. As quickly as people yield to Him, He works in them and begins to produce the same unity, power, and glory that we read of in the New Testament. At first, there was just Jesus. The only man in the entire world with a pure heart, the new Adam. Then others got saved. Then the Holy Ghost came upon them and in them. There was still just a handful. <b>There has always been a handful,</b> even when the New Testament church reached its zenith in numbers. At times in the history of God&#8217;s church, there have been more, and then the tides have receded, and there were less. But
the family of God is both in heaven and on earth (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+3%3A15">Ephesians 3:15</a>),
and the gates of hell have never prevailed against the church. <b>We need to see it as God sees it.</b> Jesus would like to
walk to Emmaus with you (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+24%3A13-36">Luke 24:13-36</a>).
He would like to open the scriptures to you while your heart burns like fire within you. He would like to convince you of the reasonableness and appropriateness of all the Divine doings in the great war between right and wrong until you cry from the depths of a persuaded heart,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;He hath done all things well.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+7%3A37" title="Mark 7:37"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 7:37)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>It is disheartening to look at the backsliders and those with a-name-to-live-while-dead, but God has better things for us to see. There are those who are responding; there are those who need seed sown among them. There is much to do of God&#8217;s scheduling and appointment, and it is such a privilege to labor in the Lord&#8217;s vineyard. There are barren trees to dig about, and the everlasting gospel to proclaim. There are pure minds to stir by way of remembrance; there are those things which God would have strengthened, which are ready to die. There is a heaven to gain and a hell to shun.</p>

<p>Take courage, thou who lovest God truly! The time is short. God knows what He is doing. Seek Him for <i>all</i> that He has to bestow. Tarry till you be endued. Then let Him labor within you as He wills and chooses till faith is lost in sight.</p>

<h1>The Argument of My Own Heart</h1>

<h2>(<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+16%3A8">John 16:8</a>)</h2>
<p>We do not hear of the opposition to holiness that we once did; perhaps it is because the standard (in the minds of men generally) is as much too low as it was once too high.</p>

<p>Honest, spiritually-minded men stood strong against what they thought to be an impracticable teaching of Adamic or angelic perfection, and justly so, if that had been true (and perhaps it was in some instances) and thus they were blinded to the real, the true experience of perfect love, love out of a pure heart, Christian perfection, or the various expressions used to denote the second work of grace.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, every twice-born soul who keeps living and active has a heart that hungers for the experience even if, for lack of understanding, their lips denounce it.</p>

<p>Reverend J. B&#8212;&#8212; was a very fine man, and a splendid preacher, with the &#8220;solar light&#8221; beaming from his countenance; yet he fought holiness, and considered it his duty to do so, because of the conception he had of the teaching. Here was a man with an incredulous mind but an honest soul, who, like the man in the following poem, needed to see entire sanctification lived as well as clearly taught, to offset, overbalance, and outweigh any theological teaching that comes short of the second definite instantaneous work of grace.</p>

<p class="verse">I&#8217;d rather see a sermon than to hear one, any day.<br />I&#8217;d rather one would walk with me than merely tell the way,<br />All travelers can witness, the best of guides today<br />Is not the one who tells them, but the one who leads the way.<br />Fine counsel is confusing, but examples bring no fear.<br />Right living speaks a language that to everyone is clear.<br />The best of all the preachers are the ones who live their creed,<br />More what they are than what they say will cause men to take heed.<br />Though an able speaker charm me with his eloquence, I say<br />I&#8217;d rather see a sermon than to hear one, any day.</p>

<p>Somewhere this man had touched a life that had convinced him of something beyond him, and started a train of thought as to a possibility that he had not conceived. I remember well the first sermon I saw, on the inward, undisturbed peace of entire sanctification.</p>

<p>In the providence of God, an opportunity was brought about, and he attended meetings conducted by an evangelist that enjoyed the real experience, as well as preached it. J. B&#8212;&#8212; carefully studied the man, as well as the doctrine as he taught it. He
compared by the Word (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+17%3A11">Acts 17:11</a>),
and the outcome, before the meetings closed, was a seeker at the altar. He found what he sought, and this is what he told us afterwards:</p>

<p>&#8220;I was very incredulous. I could arraign and impeach every presented evidence. I could down every argument until it came to the argument of my own heart. There was that irresistible, unsatisfied longing. My heart was craving purity, and longed for the cleansing blood. It yearned for perfect love, and inexpressible was the desire for the indwelling of the blessed Holy Spirit. This argument overcame every other argument, and I could no longer withstand the argument of my own heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>We, as a congregation, appreciated this man&#8217;s sermons before this epoch, but from that time on he
fed the flock of God (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+21%3A17">John 21:17</a>).
&#8220;We know not how
the Spirit moves, convincing men of sin&#8221; (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+16%3A8">John 16:8</a>).
</p>

<p>
How marvelous is Bible conviction, especially noticeable when it falls suddenly upon a soul (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+9%3A3">Acts 9:3</a>).
Preconceived ideas, vital questions, that were thought to have been settled by strong argument beyond controversy, are swept away by the overwhelming argument of a hungry heart.</p>

<p>An unusually intelligent young man, that we had been praying for, had imbibed atheistic ideas, and had long since settled the question of his responsibility to God from that viewpoint. One morning during the progress of a revival meeting, just as he started to his work his mother gently appealed to him to go to the meeting and give his heart to God.</p>

<p>He looked up in surprise, and said, &#8220;Why, Mother, you know I do not believe in those things any more. That question is settled.&#8221; He went on to his work, but he said later on, in testimony, &#8220;Right there began the argument of my own heart, that soon made a complete overthrow of all those &#8216;settled&#8217; questions. I wondered why my breast should heave; why I should sigh and groan; and why should tears blind me so that I could not go on with my work, when I did not believe in the Christian religion. But all I said did not make any difference. There was the irresistible argument of my own heart.&#8221; By the convincing power of the Holy Spirit he realized the truth, and it was the decision of his judgment that the only common sense thing to do was to give his heart to God, and at once. He knelt down right there, in the basement where he had been working alone, but he encountered such strong opposing forces that he realized he must have the help of the prayers of others, and make a full surrender of himself to God, if he ever could get away from the power of the enemy that held him. Yes, he would go to the meeting, or do anything. But could God for Christ&#8217;s sake forgive all his sins?</p>

<p>We will never forget that night. As he came to the altar, dry-eyed but with determination written on his countenance, he said to the evangelist, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I feel as deeply as I ought.&#8221; The evangelist looked him right in the eye, and said, &#8220;Do you mean it?&#8221; &#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; and we knew he did. &#8220;That&#8217;s enough, God will help you.&#8221; It was a transaction. He was dealing with the Infinite. Surrendering to God meant something; a fearful battle ensued, the unseen forces of evil, that had held him in bondage so long, fought hard. But those that
<span class="scripture">&#8220;stand by the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> of the whole earth&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Zechariah+4%3A14" title="Zechariah 4:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Zechariah 4:14)</span></a></span>
became desperate in prayer, and prevailed. God came, broke the shackles, and set him free from the thralldom of unbelief, the one great power of the deceiver of the nations, that holds them like cables of steel.</p>

<p>Freedom to serve our gracious God is a wonderful privilege, and he has since been greatly blessed in His service, and has been entrusted with a large and growing work which has prospered in his hands.</p>

<p>As we intercede for souls, how we ought to ask in faith, to really expect the Holy Spirit to move upon them with such irresistible force as to overthrow, to bring to end, to utterly defeat, every other argument but that all-convincing argument of their own hearts.
He gives His people an expected end (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+29%3A11-13%3B+Psalm+62%3A5">Jeremiah 29:11-13; Psalm 62:5</a>).
</p>

<p>Many years ago, an aged mother in Israel told me of her father&#8217;s experience in his last illness, when she was a child of twelve summers.</p>

<p>He was a saved soul among a people who lived the first work of grace, but knew nothing of the second work.</p>

<p>He lay sick for some months, and died, or appeared to, but revived and lived some weeks. While he was unconscious to things of time and sense, yet he was thoroughly conscious to things of the Spirit, communing with the Lord, repeating Scripture, and praying for a clean heart. He would plead and pray, with the tears rolling down his face, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Create in me a clean heart, O God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+51%3A10" title="Psalm 51:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 51:10)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Like any child perplexed, she said to her mother, &#8220;What does Father want?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her reply was, &#8220;He wants the Lord to give him a clean heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t the Lord give it to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will,&#8221; answered the mother; &#8220;now you watch over him, while I work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did watch over him,&#8221; she went on to say, &#8220;very closely indeed, for if God was going to give him a clean heart I wanted to see when He did it. And I did, I surely did.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father had been praying and pleading the promises until his pillow was wet with tears. The earnestness of his soul I shall never forget. Suddenly there was a wonderful change. His face lit up with &#8216;a light ne&#8217;er seen on land or sea,&#8217; a heavenly radiance; and simultaneously praise burst from his lips, and he shouted and praised God with all his limited strength. I ran out to Mother, saying &#8216;He&#8217;s got it, he&#8217;s got it. The Lord did give it to him,&#8217; as happy as I could be; and great joy beamed upon my dear mother&#8217;s face, as she saw the reflected glory, and listened to those words of adoring praise. He lingered still another week or more praising God with every breath, but remained utterly unconscious to the most tender solicitations of loved ones, or any effort to win his recognition.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was one of those strong proofs of the undeniable argument of the human heart hungering for holiness, and that it can be met, even when beyond the realization of earthly surroundings. For God can deal with a soul at such a time, just as
<span class="scripture">&#8220;in a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed; then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Job+33%3A15%2C16" title="Job 33:15,16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Job 33:15,16)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>For years, I have had a settled conviction that I must never give up a soul that has been laid on my heart, but keep believing; for even in their latest moments, they may catch the vision of the Christ. It is possible that the seeking Savior may so be revealed that they can even then let everything go under the atoning blood, and trust such love. This is the confidence I have in Him.</p>

<p>I could mention many incidents in which this undoubtedly was the fact; for that &#8220;solar light,&#8221; the glory from the upper courts, illuminated the dying face and was lingering still when we looked upon it for the last time in the casket.</p>

<p>My one great desire is for an early yielded life of blessed service, and I deeply feel the heartbreak to see souls living for themselves, carelessly ignoring the claims of God to whom they owe everything. They are missing the best here in this life, and may miss heaven in the hereafter. Yet, I feel to hold on by prayer and faith, still pleading pardoning mercy, even to life&#8217;s close; for if they will yield and are saved, yet so as by fire, there is an eternity in which to love and serve the Lord.</p>

<p>It is a most unbearable thought, that anyone that I have carried on my heart these years should spend eternity hating with ever-increasing hatred their beneficent Creator.</p>

<p>For this reason, beyond all other reasons,
I will never give up a soul this side of the great divide (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+5%3A20">James 5:20</a>).

<p class="verse">But soon after that, joy will lack,<br />As child becomes accepted fact.<br />Child&#8217;s novelty soon wears away,<br />His presence occupies each day.<br />He who once was a joy to care<br />Becomes a burden hard to bear.<br />Child&#8217;s naughtiness is soon revealed,<br />His innocence so soon repealed.<br />Did Parent actually believe,<br />Was Parent possibly deceived<br />To thinking that sweet child would<br />Be sweet, innocent, and always good?<br />Could Parent have been unaware<br />In helpless child, lurking there,<br />Were seeds of wrath, by nature laid,<br />Hidden since child first was made?<br />Poor Child, he was not to blame<br />For Adam&#8217;s sin within his frame,<br />&#8217;Twas given him without a choice,<br />He couldn&#8217;t raise rejecting voice.<br />So, as was custom of his clan,<br />Parent followed their master plan.<br />Poor Child, with sin original,<br />Was brought to the Baptismal;<br />And there the priest declared sin dead<br />By pouring water on Child&#8217;s head.<br />Yet this could not destroy that pest,<br />But wash Child&#8217;s head alone, at best.<br />That fiend remained in Child&#8217;s heart,<br />Child&#8217;s misery was soon to start.<br />And so that root, it sought always<br />A chance to go on bold display,<br />A chance to raise its ugly head,<br />Refuse the right, do wrong instead.</p>

<p class="verse">For many years, Child hid in there,<br />Oblivious to Parent&#8217;s care,<br />Exploring every hidden thing.<br />In Child&#8217;s hideout, Child was king.<br />Here Child threw off every net<br />Placed by Parent he&#8217;d soon forget.<br />And now, with every stop removed,<br />With no more Parent to reprove,<br />Poor Child started on the path<br />That nearly brought him quick to death.<br />The roots were laid for sin&#8217;s career.<br />In Child&#8217;s mind, his plan was clear.<br />He walked the wild side of life,<br />Forgetting all Parental strife.<br />He swam in liquor&#8217;s murky pools,<br />In Child&#8217;s world, Child made the rules.<br />He followed every fleshly thought,<br />Dark carnal lust alone he sought.<br />He tried tobacco&#8217;s Stygian smoke,<br />To further smash Parental yoke.<br />Wild Child ran from sin to sin,<br />Suppressing growing guilt within.<br />Then sin, through long continuance,<br />Became the lord for whom Child danced.<br />While sin appeared as sociable,<br />Poor Child grew uncontrollable.<br />For Child by force had been dethroned,<br />As sin became king all alone.<br />Yes, Child was forced, sin to obey,<br />no longer choosing his own way.<br />He&#8217;d tried the road of sin and found<br />His hopes came tumbling to the ground.<br />Oh, how he longed for former days,<br />When his free spirit, then ablaze,<br />Would challenge all authority,<br />Refuse to bend a humble knee,<br />Unflinching &#8217;neath the threatening wave,<br />Displaying blazing courage, brave!<br />Now, in defeated misery,<br />Forced to concede the victory,<br />Held fast by sin&#8217;s infernal mire,<br />Was Child – bound for eternal fire.<br />And Parent in the shadow stood,<br />Unable to help if he could,<br />For Child turned his back on him,<br />The bond between stretched paper thin.<br />Their years of war in Child bred,<br />A heart of stone, a conscience dead.<br />(Wonder if Parent ever came<br />To realize he was part to blame?)</p>

<p class="verse">Yet, if we&#8217;ll strain, in Child we&#8217;ll see<br />A tiny spark of honesty.<br />For years, &#8217;twas hid from mortal sight,<br />But Jesus, in His holy might,<br />Had recognized Child&#8217;s true desire<br />And fanned that spark to burning fire.<br />He caught Child on the downward slope<br />And filled his heart with living hope.<br />There Jesus sent two angels in,<br />Whose words convinced Child of his sin.<br />They spoke of heavenly things above,<br />Detailed a Savior&#8217;s precious love;<br />They cried, &#8220;Faith is the Victory&#8221;,<br />The Word of Life the holy key,<br />By whose example Child was sure<br />That Jesus was his only cure.<br />Now Child, engulfed in gloomy woe,<br />Contested with a greater foe.<br />No longer wishing Sin to serve,<br />His protest did that king unnerve.<br />There Hell recoiled with all its might,<br />And threw its fierceness to the fight;<br />Unwilling to let Child go,<br />Its fiery darts more swift did throw.<br />And each time Child seemed to gain,<br />Sin fought the more, king to remain.<br />Child&#8217;s past parental war seemed bliss;<br />Seemed child&#8217;s play, compared to this.<br />In trying to break sin&#8217;s control,<br />Child warred for his immortal soul.<br />Child found that sin, once his delight,<br />Had chained and bound him choking tight.<br />Days, weeks, months, and years did flee,<br />Each closer to eternity.<br />Poor Child with bitter disgrace<br />And bleak despair across his face,<br />Was tempted, as sin would entreat,<br />To quick accept his sure defeat.<br />And oft Child nearly gave in,<br />nearly declared the victor: Sin.<br />But Jesus, bless His holy name,<br />Kept hope alive in Child&#8217;s frame,<br />Not willing that Child be lost<br />Since He had paid such awful cost.<br />He longed to set Child&#8217;s path aright;<br />In His blood, wash Child&#8217;s garments white.</p>

<p class="verse">So Child, in anguish deep and loud,<br />This same child who once was so proud,<br />Came bowing low at Jesus&#8217; feet,<br />For full salvation did entreat;<br />And Jesus, faithful to His word,<br />When Child&#8217;s humble cry was heard<br />Sent glowing peace to Child&#8217;s soul;<br />In that great moment, Child was whole.<br />Oh, how dear Child&#8217;s spirit danced,<br />Aglow with God&#8217;s deliverance.<br />Joy permeated every nerve,<br />A joy Child never did deserve.<br />For he, who was so dead, had been<br />Miraculously born again.<br />He sat now in a heavenly place,<br />Peace and contentment on his face,<br />And from this lofty spirit plane,<br />Reviewed his past as dead and vain.<br />The sin, he once blindly enjoyed,<br />By Jesus&#8217; power, had been destroyed.<br />While pondering this precious find,<br />Rejected Parent came to mind.<br />All hate and wrath now purged away,<br />Child sought dear Parent night and day.<br />A song of joy could Child sing,<br />A ray of hope to Parent bring.<br />Child, sure that Parent would desire,<br />The warmth of Christ&#8217;s refining fire,<br />Declared the miracle within,<br />That Jesus saves and keeps from sin.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>
<p class="verse">Now, Parent had religion, too,<br />And was devoted through and through.<br />Each Sunday found him on his knees,<br />Other six found him as he pleased.<br />Did his God not require much,<br />Just now and then to keep in touch?<br />Did God say do the best you can,<br />And I&#8217;ll accept you in the end?<br />There seemed no need to read God&#8217;s word,<br />He seemed content with what he heard.<br />Parent would not investigate<br />The words he heard the priest relate.<br />Like his parents, and theirs before,<br />He clung to their tradition lore.<br />And all this, Child understood,<br />For Child, too, in childhood,<br />Devoutly followed Parent&#8217;s lead,<br />Adopting his religious creed.<br />For every Sunday, Child, too,<br />Would occupy his special pew<br />And listen as the priest would tell<br />Their set way of escaping Hell.<br />But one thing bothered Child then,<br />One gnawing question deep within,<br />He&#8217;d heard about a God above<br />Whose special attribute was love.<br />In worship Parent would proclaim<br />And call himself by Jesus&#8217; name,<br />Yet Child often wondered hard<br />At family life, so battle-marred.<br />If God were love, and they were His,<br />Then why did so much war exist?<br />Child couldn&#8217;t figure out nor see<br />What caused this inconsistency.<br />Did Parent actually believe&#8230;&#8203;<br />Was Parent possibly deceived&#8230;&#8203;<br />In thinking the whole problem lay<br />With Child&#8217;s refusal to obey?<br />Could not the God, whom Parent served,<br />Supply the grace to calm his nerves?<br />Why did he waste such energy<br />By fighting to gain loyalty?<br />Could he not have by secret prayer<br />Approached God with his every care?<br />Poor Child felt Parent&#8217;s fury burn,<br />But children by example learn.<br />In Child, blame in part did lay;<br />He willingly would disobey,<br />But Parent was to blame in part,<br />Forgetting from the very start,<br />The Bible rule on Child&#8217;s behalf,<br />&#8220;Fathers, provoke them not to wrath.&#8221;</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>
<p class="verse">But now willing to lay aside<br />The differences which did divide,<br />Child, beaming out his new-found peace,<br />Knew in his heart that war had ceased.<br />So sure was Child, as told before,<br />That Parent would with joy explore<br />This Canaan land of liberty,<br />Of record clean and conscience free.<br />All full of love, Child drew near,<br />Declaring truth in Parent&#8217;s ear,<br />But Parent, much to Child&#8217;s dismay,<br />Paid little heed to all he&#8217;d say.<br />Poor Parent! He was satisfied<br />That Child was wrong again and cried,<br />&#8220;I have religion and will stay<br />Devoted &#8217;til my dying day.&#8221;<br />Up, up, the shield of blind defense,<br />Gird up thy loins, with ignorance,<br />Take superstition&#8217;s crooked blade;<br />Again through force, try to persuade.</p>

<h2>IX</h2>
<p class="verse">And so it seemed that fate had sealed<br />These warriors to the battlefield.<br />But clashing in a bloodless fray,<br />Unlike the wars of yesterday,<br />Strong Child attacks in godly fear<br />And loves his foe and holds him dear.<br />Unlike the wars of yesterday,<br />When selfish Child sought his own way,<br />He battles now for truth and right,<br />And labours in Jehovah&#8217;s might.<br />So full is Child of confidence<br />With God&#8217;s own word as his defense,<br />Child hurls shots at Parent&#8217;s wall,<br />The force of which prepare its fall.<br />Parent&#8217;s religion cannot stand<br />The light of Heaven&#8217;s master plan;<br />For though her edifice is grand,<br />She&#8217;s built on ever shifting sand.<br />And though for years, she&#8217;s made her boast<br />Of holding sway o&#8217;er heaven&#8217;s host,<br />Her history, inscribed with blood,<br />Shows not the love of Holy God.<br />And Child, beholding Parent&#8217;s face,<br />Can sense a lack of saving grace.<br />Each challenge Child can prepare<br />Is met with hollow, empty stare.<br />Poor Parent, by his silence shows,<br />That deep inside, he surely knows:<br />He may be wrong. He may be lost.<br />Pride carries such an awful cost.<br />Is Parent making big mistake?<br />Won&#8217;t he consider for soul&#8217;s sake?<br />Why will he stubbornly ignore<br />The Word of God when brought before?<br />Young Child has weighed the evidence,<br />Given both sides an equal chance,<br />Can by the power of heaven&#8217;s might,<br />Declare which of the two is right.<br />But Parent cannot make that claim,<br />And Parent is alone to blame.<br />For he has been endowed from birth<br />With intellect of precious worth.<br />And he does willingly refuse<br />The Holy Volume to peruse.<br />If he be lost eternally,<br />&#8217;Twill be his fault exclusively.</p>

<h2>X</h2>
<p class="verse">So Child, by night, and every day,<br />Fervently ceases not to pray<br />That Parent may be reconciled,<br />First unto God, then unto Child.<br />But as for Child, he&#8217;ll never cease<br />His upward trek for Heaven&#8217;s peace.<br />For though his Parent he holds near,<br />Child&#8217;s God and Christ remain more dear.<br />If Child had to choose between,<br />He&#8217;d choose the Parent never seen,<br />For He&#8217;s true Father, He above,<br />Who saved Child by His boundless love,<br />Who washed away confusion&#8217;s mist,<br />And gave Child purpose to exist.<br />Yet love for Parent, Child will keep,<br />A love through bitter years grown deep;<br />&#8217;Tis love expressed for Parent&#8217;s soul,<br />In hopes, to God, he&#8217;ll give control.<br />So, toiling on in endless prayer,<br />Child hopes that Parent will prepare.<br />Oh blessed thought, there reconciled,<br />Saved Parent and his lowly Child,<br />Together at Jehovah&#8217;s throne<br />In Heaven&#8217;s blessed endless home.</p>

<h1>&#8220;I Write Unto You, Young Men&#8221;</h1>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first"><span class="scripture">&#8220;I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+2%3A14" title="I&nbsp;John 2:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 2:14)</span></a></span></p>
</div>


<hr class="minor" />
<p>Young men, I want to speak to you concerning a fundamental aspect of spiritual warfare&#8212;what constitutes sin? There is incredible confusion on this point, and small wonder, since the enemy of our soul finds great advantage in convincing us that he has captured us when he hasn&#8217;t, and in convincing us that we are not captured by him when we are, and yet more advantage in keeping us in a state of confusion and uncertainty about the whole matter. It is my burden to help any who read this to understand better how to become or remain one of those who
<span class="scripture">&#8220;have overcome the wicked one.&#8221;</span>
</p>

<p>First, let us examine some scriptures that address what we are held accountable for.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+9%3A41" title="John 9:41"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 9:41)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin&#8230;&#8203;If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+14%3A22%2C24" title="John 14:22,24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 14:22,24)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Our Lord teaches that knowledge and awareness gives accountability. &#8220;We see&#8221;; and Jesus had &#8220;spoken unto them,&#8221; and &#8220;done among them the works which none other man did.&#8221; They were accountable according to their exposure to truth. They were judged as sinners because of their response to the light that had been shown to them.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+3%3A20" title="Romans 3:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 3:20)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.)&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+5%3A13" title="Romans 5:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 5:13)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+7%3A7" title="Romans 7:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 7:7)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>The apostle Paul confirms that knowledge and awareness give accountability. &#8220;&#8230;&#8203;for by the law is the knowledge of sin&#8221;; &#8220;sin is not imputed when there is no law&#8221;; &#8220;I had not known sin, but by the law.&#8221; Again, we are speaking of that which makes us guilty before God, and an awareness of the standard is required before accountability is fixed.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject; Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+3%3A10-11" title="Titus 3:10-11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Titus 3:10-11)</span></a></span>
Is the &#8220;heretick&#8221; a sinner because he is honestly mistaken and holds to what is false and brings division? No, he is a sinner because he has gone against some light that he has&#8212;&#8220;being condemned of himself.&#8221; He has done something he knew in his heart was wrong.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+4%3A17" title="James 4:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 4:17)</span></a></span>
It is at the point that we know a good thing we are to do, that it becomes a point of accountability, and if we don&#8217;t do it, we sin. Consider: from the age of twelve, Jesus knew something of His calling. For eighteen years the needs of a lost world were presented to His consciousness before He began to minister publicly. In Capernaum, there were many seeking Him and eager for His help, but He left. God had specific assignments of &#8220;doing good&#8221; for Him, and He has specific assignments for us. When we <i>know</i> what our assignment is, and don&#8217;t do it, that is sin.</p>

<p>Going on, let us consider some scriptures which address the subject of temptation and sin, and identify where a person is counted a transgressor.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A15" title="Hebrews 4:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 4:15)</span></a></span>
Although it may seem obvious, it bears repeating that temptation is not sin. Jesus, our high priest, had our human &#8220;infirmities,&#8221; and was subject to temptation while down here. Do you think Jesus saw the devil standing in front of Him in an easily recognizable form when He was tempted in the wilderness? It says He &#8220;was in all points tempted like as we are.&#8221; Most people I know (including myself) are tempted from inside our minds, often very subtly (like the serpent), and sometimes by very aggressive evil and frightening thoughts (like a roaring lion).</p>

<p>On the night that Jesus was betrayed, he started praying
<span class="scripture">&#8220;O, my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mattehw+26%3A39" title="Mattehw 26:39"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mattehw 26:39)</span></a></span>
It was not sin for Jesus to have the feeling of wanting to avoid what was coming. It was not sin for Jesus to ask the Father if it would be possible to escape it, because He stayed submissive&#8212;asking, and submitting.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: Neither give place to the devil.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+4%3A26-27" title="Ephesians 4:26-27"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 4:26-27)</span></a></span>
Here we see some important distinctions. We have a human nature, subject to feelings, impressions, desires and reactions. It is not the feeling of anger that is sin, but what it can stir us to do, and how the devil can use it to gain an advantage. To let the &#8220;sun go down upon&#8221; something is to let it go unattended. One time I said to a pushy salesman, &#8220;I want to sleep on it,&#8221; referring to my desire to wait until the pressures of the moment were gone (including him) and for my feelings to wane so I could have time to soberly reflect. While there are many things that it is best to handle in this way, controlling wrath is not one of them. We are not to simply let our feelings of anger control us and direct us, and then &#8220;repent at leisure.&#8221; We must engage in spiritual warfare now, as soon as we realize we&#8217;re angry, and get as much help from God as we need to control ourselves and our reactions to do what is right.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A26-27" title="Hebrews 10:26-27"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 10:26-27)</span></a></span>
When Adam and Eve ate the fruit, something <i>changed</i> in their hearts&#8212;they no longer were eager for the Lord&#8217;s evening visit in the Garden. If we cross the boundary, there is evidence in our hearts&#8212;something has changed, and now there is &#8220;a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation.&#8221; It is when you stop resisting, stop struggling against the temptation, stop fighting, and &#8220;wilfully&#8221; do whatever the devil is trying to get you to do. It was not the considering whether to eat the fruit (though that was foolish and showed that Eve was in serious trouble), but <b>eating it</b> that brought the condemnation.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law&#8230;&#8203;Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him&#8230;&#8203;Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+3%3A4%2C6%2C9" title="I&nbsp;John 3:4,6,9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 3:4,6,9)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+1%3A14-15" title="James 1:14-15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 1:14-15)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>The picture of the process these scriptures show is vital to comprehend. A child of God doesn&#8217;t just accidentally sin, or suddenly sin; indeed &#8220;he cannot sin&#8221; while he is abiding in the Lord. But there is a process, a drawing away and enticing, until a &#8220;conception&#8221; occurs, where two things unite: the wrong thing that is presented and the will of the person tempted.</p>

<p>Finally, let us consider some scriptures which address the subject of growing in light. At one point I don&#8217;t know that something is wrong, but the Lord is teaching me that it is wrong; or, I think something is wrong, but the Lord is teaching me that it is acceptable in His sight.</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled. But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse. But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak. For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol&#8217;s temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols; And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died? But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ. Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+8%3A7-13" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 8:7-13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 8:7-13)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men. Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another. For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence. It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak. Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+14%3A17-23" title="Romans 14:17-23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 14:17-23)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>We see, first of all, how the Lord works with us in giving us light and understanding. We have a conception of right and wrong, and we are accountable according to that standard. At the same time, the Lord wants to improve our understanding, so that it is more accurate, releasing us from false standards and holding us to true ones. But He holds us accountable to our current understanding. Until we no longer doubt, but are convinced of the new standard, the old applies&#8212;&#8220;for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.&#8221; We see by the context that the word &#8220;faith&#8221; here refers to the current place of the believer in their walk with God, encompassing the light and understanding they possess at the time. We also see again that God requires of us a love for others and their spiritual welfare: &#8220;But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.&#8221; As it is written:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+5%3A13-14" title="Galatians 5:13-14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 5:13-14)</span></a></span>
Is it not more and more obvious how important it is to learn to recognize and respond to the Lord (in whatever way He is communicating to us) and recognize and reject the devil (in whatever way he is communicating to us)? It is not the Lord communicating to the weak brother when he decides that the knowledgeable brother must be doing the right thing, &#8220;so I&#8217;ll do it, too.&#8221; It is not the Lord communicating to the knowledgeable brother when he sees the weak brother and thinks that the important thing is his own liberty.</p>

<p>Young men, ask the Lord for clarity. Resist temptation! Don&#8217;t ever give up! Don&#8217;t let the devil persuade you that you&#8217;ve lost when you&#8217;re still fighting! If you have crossed a line, repent, and seek the Lord for forgiveness and power to live for Him!

<h1>The Boy of Faith</h1>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">The secret of his strength was his whole-hearted desire to please God, as a child loves his father. It is a secret every boy today can know through faith.</p>
</div>


<hr class="minor" />
<p>&#8220;I can bear the punishment better than my sister. Let me remain,&#8221; the young boy said determinedly.</p>

<p>The tribal chief looked at his oldest son with despair. He had lost a war with a neighboring tribe, and, according to custom, had given Kaboo up to be their prisoner until the ransom could be paid. Twice before he had brought all the valuables his tribe could gather. The chief of the victorious tribe would not accept the offerings at their true value. He had become addicted to alcohol, and had decided to keep Kaboo, so he could continue to get more goods from Kaboo&#8217;s tribe, which he could trade in for more alcohol. If they did not continue to pay, Kaboo would be tortured. Yet his tribe was nearly poverty-stricken by the lost war, and all the valuables they had given up.</p>

<p>Finally Kaboo&#8217;s father had come with the offer to trade one of his daughters for Kaboo. But Kaboo would not hear of it. Once, after a previous war, in which his father could not complete the ransom amount for many years, Kaboo had been tortured. He knew his sister couldn&#8217;t bear it. So he willingly decided to remain instead of his sister. His father could do nothing more, except to return home, and hope that some day he would save enough to ransom his son.</p>

<p>When the drunken chief realized that Kaboo&#8217;s father was not going to pay him any more, he got very angry. He ordered that Kaboo should be whipped every day. So, every day, Kaboo was taken out and whipped with a thorny, poisonous vine. As the whip cut his back, Kaboo felt as though he were burning up. No money came from his tribe, though, and every day Kaboo was whipped harder than before. The angry chief ordered one of his slaves, who was from Kaboo&#8217;s tribe, to go, after each whipping, and tell Kaboo&#8217;s father about the agony his son was suffering. But what could Kaboo&#8217;s father do? He had nothing. His tribe had nothing. They had given every last thing they could.</p>

<p>The torture did not stop. Every day Kaboo grew weaker and more feverish. Soon he could not stand. The wicked chief could not be satisfied. He ordered that branches be set up which they would throw Kaboo on and whip him. Kaboo could now scarcely think. He hoped he would die and be out of his misery. He watched other slaves from his tribe accused of witchcraft being torn to pieces by the evil chief&#8217;s drunken tribe. He wondered if that would happen to him.</p>

<p>But the brutal chief had something more atrocious in mind for Kaboo. If Kaboo&#8217;s father did not pay after the last beating, Kaboo was to be buried to his neck in the ground. Then, after forcing his mouth open, they would smear sweet juice from it to a large ant hill nearby. After he had suffered agonies with that, they would then have the final work be done by the dreaded driver ants&#8212;he would slowly be eaten alive by them, and his skeleton propped up to be a warning to others.</p>

<p>The final day came, and Kaboo was dragged out to his last whipping. They threw him onto the waiting branches and prepared to beat him. Kaboo felt death approaching.</p>

<p>Suddenly a blinding light burst around him. &#8220;Rise up and flee!&#8221; a loud voice called. Everyone there saw and heard it. Obeying the voice, Kaboo leapt up, and, finding himself strong and well, ran off into the jungle, leaving the awe-struck savages quaking.</p>

<p>Kaboo did not know what had saved him. But he did know that he had been raised from near death to health, and that he owed his life to someone or something. It was a week later that he stumbled out of the jungle at a mission. Here he learned of God, the One who had sent the light and delivered him. How thankful Kaboo was then! He was eager to learn about Jesus and become a child of God. Now with simple, trusting faith, the young boy set out to live his life for his heavenly Father.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Two or three years had passed on the African coast.</p>

<p>One fine morning, the sun shone brightly on the sand, and glinted off the tops of the waves splashing on the beach. Anchored some distance from the shore, a merchant ship rose and fell with the swells. In the morning light, a boat could be seen leaving its side, pulling for the shore. When it reached the beach, and the captain of the ship got out to direct the loading of cargo.</p>

<p>A dark-skinned youth hurried up to him. &#8220;My Father told me you would take me to New York to see Stephen Merritt,&#8221; he said confidently.</p>

<p>The captain stared at this boy. Who did he think he was? &#8220;Where is your father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In heaven,&#8221; the boy said, without hesitation.</p>

<p>The captain swore. His mother had told him about God and Jesus when he was a young child, but that had been long ago, and in his life at sea, he had only gone deeper and deeper in sin. When he did mention God, it was only to take His name in vain. &#8220;My ship does not carry passengers. You must be crazy.&#8221; He swore again and strode off.</p>

<p>The boy was not discouraged by this. He knew his Father would take care of it all. He had been seeking to learn more about God and His Holy Spirit, and finally his questions had sent him here. &#8220;Stephen Merritt in New York would know,&#8221; he was told, and so he had set out to find him.</p>

<p>During all of that long, hot day, he waited patiently by the boat. In the evening the captain came down to the beach, and prepared to set out with the things he had gotten. The dark youth knelt down and pled with the captain to take him. But, after threatening to kick him, the captain returned to the ship, and the boy was left alone on the beach.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Foundation_Truth_7/samuel.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="240" /></div>
<p>All that night he stayed there. He slept for awhile. Mostly he just waited and talked to his Father in heaven. In the morning the captain came again with the boat. The dark youth begged him again, and again he was refused. The hours slowly crawled by, and the boat returned to the ship again that night without him. And the boy spent his second night on the beach, fasting and praying. He&#8217;d had nothing to eat since he&#8217;d arrived there, but he trusted that his Father would care for him.</p>

<p>Sunday morning dawned with renewed hope for the African boy, for God&#8217;s mercies are &#8220;new every morning.&#8221; He had received a promise in the night. When the boat came to shore the third time, the boy came up to the captain with the utmost confidence and said, &#8220;My Father told me last night that you would take me this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain stared at him, amazed and bewildered. Could God have been dealing with the captain&#8217;s heart? The night before, two of the crew had deserted, and he was now short on help. He could see that this boy was of the Kru tribe, and they were known for being experienced sailors. He thought about it a moment. &#8220;How much pay do you want?&#8221; he asked, shrewdly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; the boy replied calmly, &#8220;only take me to New York to see Stephen Merritt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, then,&#8221; the captain nodded, &#8220;you may go.&#8221; He turned to the crew, and told them to take the African boy aboard.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith. And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+18%3A6%2C7" title="Luke 18:6,7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 18:6,7)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Kaboo, the dark-skinned boy, came to be known as Samuel Morris, &#8220;the apostle of simple faith.&#8221; Wherever he went&#8212;aboard ship, in New York, and later to Taylor University&#8212;Samuel was ready to tell others about his Father. His simple and earnest faith touched many lives, including the captain of the ship. For a full account of his short life, read Samuel Morris by Lindley Baldwin.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Consider:</h2>
<p>What showed that Kaboo was not a selfish boy?</p>

<p>When the voice told Kaboo to flee, what did he do? Was it something he felt like doing?</p>

<p>When Kaboo obeyed the voice, even though he didn&#8217;t know what would happen, he was acting in faith. How did faith bring him to become a child of God?</p>

<p>Where did Kaboo stay when the captain refused to take him along? Why?</p>

<p>Why did the captain change his mind?</p>

<p>Could you trust God like a Father? Why or why not?</p>

<h1>Letter and Reply</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Elois,</p>

<p>We received the latest issue of Foundation Truth last week&#8230;. There are many things we appreciate about it and enjoy reading. I do have some questions and comments I&#8217;d like to share and hope to get answers to.</p>

<p>My first questions have to do with the two articles about Christmas. My husband and I were not raised in godly homes and we celebrated Christmas with Santa and the birth of Christ sort of mixed up together. We were both saved within months after our first child was born, in 1982. We knew we would never teach her or any of our children the &#8220;Santa&#8221; myth. We knew it was wrong simply because we would be lying to our children. We would be teaching them that it was alright to tell lies. Of course we know who the liar and father of all lies is. So this was unacceptable to even consider.</p>

<p>In our circle of friends and acquaintances over the years even the half-hearted Christians would not include Santa though they did not hesitate to set up a tree, lights and give gifts. This was somehow all to honor the birth of Christ. I remember the first time someone ever mentioned to me the idea of not celebrating Christmas. This was about 15 years ago or so. I, as a professing Christian, could not believe what she said. How could a Christian not celebrate the birth of Jesus! She was not a Christian at the time, though did come to know Him in later years. She was a very intelligent person and did not know Christ but did know her history. She challenged me that as a believer I shouldn&#8217;t be involved with such a thing. Christmas as we know it was in actuality a pagan holiday. The Emperor Constantine after his so-called conversion to Christianity declared this day as Christ&#8217;s birth. This was to appease the people so they could continue to celebrate and yet follow along with him. He was concerned that they might rebel because some of their pleasure had been taken away&#8230;. To be honest it did concern me then but I pushed the thoughts away. I enjoyed Christmas! All the Christians I knew at the time celebrated it, so it must be alright. I did not even share this conversation with my husband. About ten years ago we came to fellowship with some other people. A separated people. Those who cared more about what the Lord had to say than other people. They were willing to give up the traditions of men for the will of God. They shared the article I have enclosed with this letter to you. Needless to say, after my husband and I read it the Lord brought to my remembrance the conversation with my friend I just related to you. To be honest, I had never forgotten it. I would think of it every year. We both sought the Lord in earnest and knew He would just have us give it up altogether&#8230;.</p>

<p>Obviously you and your family feel different about celebrating December 25th&#8230;. To us it is a pagan holiday that was &#8220;Christianized&#8221; to appease the people&#8230;&#8203;You seem to condone the manger scene as a way to celebrate the birth of Christ on December 25th. Yes, we do rejoice in the birth of Jesus our Savior but the Scriptures tell us to participate in communion, remembering His crucifixion, to partake of the body and blood of Christ, which purchased our pardon.
This we are to do in remembrance of Him (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+11%3A23-26">I&nbsp;Corinthians 11:23-26</a>)&#8230;.
The babe in the manger is a very pleasing thought to the world&#8212;even they embrace it! The cross is offensive to those who are not willing to take up their own cross and follow Christ. No wonder Christmas, including the manger scene is accepted by the world&#8230;.</p>

<p class="signature">With love and prayers,<br />Janette</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p class="noindent">Dear Janette,</p>

<p>We appreciate your questions and the time you have taken to write. We have prayerfully considered them and trust the Lord will give us all the understanding of His will.</p>

<p>The articles you enclosed have been previously read by our family, but we again read them. They have a show of wisdom in some ways, but there still remains a place in our heart that tells us it is not wrong to remember Christ&#8217;s birth. Why would God have preserved the knowledge of His Son&#8217;s birth if He didn&#8217;t want us to remember and rejoice in it? Why would we not tell this story to the children as near to reality as possible as well as all the other Bible stories?</p>

<p>I do believe we must be very careful to not allow the world&#8217;s ways into our own lives. How we each one must honestly and sincerely seek God for what pleases Him. Our prayer should be, &#8220;Lord, how do You want us to remember Your birth?&#8221;</p>

<p>We trust the following article on Christ&#8217;s birth will be a blessing to you.</p>

<p class="signature">With Christian love,<br />Elois</p>

<h1>The Birth of Jesus</h1>

<p>The term &#8220;Christmas&#8221; has come to mean a remembrance of the birth of Jesus. I do not care for the term, for it is drawn from the Catholic idea of Christ mass&#8212;a Catholic invention and false doctrine. Nevertheless, the word has come to mean a remembrance of the birth of Jesus as portrayed in the book of Luke, chapter two. The first Christmas (meaning a celebration of the birth of Jesus) is described in detail in the Bible and was the occasion of much rejoicing and thanksgiving.</p>

<p>The first false Christmas probably took place in the hearts of people who did not worship the Lord in spirit and truth. As this false worship was persisted in, various superstitions and false elements were invented. Eventually this false worship evolved into a formal recognition of a certain day of the year. Constantine&#8217;s establishing of a certain day was simply a formalizing of what already existed&#8212;namely, a false worship, unacceptable to God, and without merit before Him. It coincided with a pagan holiday.</p>

<p>The word, &#8220;celebrate,&#8221; means to observe a holiday, anniversary; to honor or praise publicly. We celebrate our anniversaries as times of special remembrance and thanksgiving of the significance of our marriage. We celebrate and commemorate each of our children&#8217;s birthdays as a day of special significance to our family. We celebrate Easter as a special day of our Lord&#8217;s resurrection. These celebrations mark days of special significance in our lives and the life of our Lord. Why should we ignore our Lord&#8217;s day of birth?</p>

<p>This question becomes especially relevant when we consider the prophecies of joy and rejoicing which were spoken of that day. The question is significant when we read of Simeon&#8217;s rejoicing as he held the baby Jesus in his arms.</p>

<p>The birth of Jesus touched off a general rejoicing and heavenly celebration such as the world has never seen or witnessed since. The heavens were filled with a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God, saying,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+2%3A14" title="Luke 2:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 2:14)</span></a></span>
This is a scene of rejoicing and celebrating of the highest order. It was echoed in the hearts of men, insomuch that
<span class="scripture">&#8220;the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+2%3A20" title="Luke 2:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 2:20)</span></a></span>
Even the resurrection of our Lord, mighty and triumphant as it was, was not attended in the same way.</p>

<p>There are those who would have us believe that all rejoicing and celebrations of this Divine Birth are out of order. That the New Testament brethren carefully ignored the birth of their Lord. That a Roman ruler instituted the remembrance of the birth of Jesus, modeling it on a pagan holiday, and therefore it is wrong to remember and celebrate the birth of Jesus.</p>

<p><b>It is inconceivable that those who truly love the Lord would fail to rejoice and celebrate the birth of Jesus, the life of Jesus, the death of Jesus, the resurrection of Jesus, and His continuing reign.</b> There is no need for a formal celebration or celebrations; indeed, there is no way to contain the rejoicing and celebrating of God&#8217;s people to a cold formality. They rejoice in the heart purity of that little Babe in the manager, that New Adam, even as they rejoice in the atonement of His death and the power of His resurrection. <b>For the cross would have no meaning without the virgin birth of the Christ child.</b></p>

<p>God&#8217;s people rejoice in the lowliness, the humility, the Divine condescension to appear in the flesh. They recognize the wonderful pattern of the hand of God at work and rejoice in the same. The cross has wondrous glory and the birth does also.</p>

<p>There is something very wrong and completely out of harmony with the Bible with a spirit that forbids God&#8217;s children to rejoice in the birth of the Son of God. They would have us believe that December 25 is off limits to rejoicing and celebrating the birth of Jesus because some ungodly person designated it a holiday. It is our privilege to rejoice and celebrate the birth of Jesus 365 days a year (including December 25) and 366 days on leap years.</p>

<p>Nor will an enlightened child of God want to mix superfluous elements in their worship and praise to God. The Spirit of God will teach us to drop all questionable elements from our remembrances&#8212;things that have nothing whatsoever to do with the birth of Jesus. Such as Christmas trees. Such as Santa Claus&#8212;the great blasphemous imposter who supposedly possesses omniscient knowledge and punitive judgment as only God does. Surely such a false and deceptive invention comes from the gates of hell itself. Parents are induced to lie to their children and deceive them by this blasphemous myth. None of this has anything whatsoever to do with worship in spirit and in truth. How thankful we are to have no desire to mingle this false stuff with our rejoicing and commemoration of the birth of our Lord!</p>

<p>We are also devoutly thankful for the God-given liberty in our heart to rejoice and praise God for the birth of His Son anytime and anywhere. For the liberty to remember His birth, life, death, and resurrection in a fitting manner at any time and as often as seems good to do so. I fully recognize that good things can become corrupted, even as
the brass serpent that Moses made for the children of Israel, for their healing, became an idol in the time of Hezekiah (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Kings+18%3A4">II&nbsp;Kings 18:4</a>),
and had to be destroyed. The whole remembrance of the birth of Jesus can become a formality and a ritual which brings no blessing to the soul. And there are plenty of examples of these things all around us. But the Bible says to
F<span class="scripture">&#8220;ret not thyself because of evil men&#8230;.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+24%3A19" title="Proverbs 24:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 24:19)</span></a></span>
I need not be diminished in my joy in the birth of the Son of God because of the revelry and banqueting of ungodly men (including professing Christians who live ungodly lives).
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+4%3A4" title="I&nbsp;Peter 4:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 4:4)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>A dear soul was staying with us over December of one year, and became disturbed because we indulged in none of the vanities of the season. &#8220;What is wrong with colored lights?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Is not Jesus the light of the world?&#8221; Colored lights? As though Jesus put out multi-colored light! If this idea was indeed a valid representation of what it claims, then would not it be appropriate to put out one great white light (like a huge spotlight) instead of a conglomeration of twinkling, blinking mass of color whose only real purpose is to delight the eye? (Does Jesus blink on and off constantly?) But, of course, this is not the point and never was the point. The multi-colored Christmas lights were not conceived to glorify God. It is all part of the same excess of riot along with the elves, reindeer, sleighs, Easter eggs, basket-carrying bunny rabbits, etc. As far as lights go, I personally like color, <b>but it has nothing whatsoever to do with the birth of Jesus.</b> I like the smell of freshly cut fir or cedar, as well (as in cutting firewood, etc.), <b>but again&#8212;it has nothing to do with the birth of Jesus.</b> I avoid the legitimate use of colored lights for practical application (such as lighting a dark wood shed) because of its erroneous association in the minds of others. (There are attractive prices of colored light bulbs in January which offer opportunity to replenish lighting capacity for appropriate and practical use, such as night lights, but even this legitimate use of these items should be approached with care because of its association in the minds of others&#8212;
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+8%3A13">I&nbsp;Corinthians 8:13</a>.)
I abhor the distracting and misleading substitutes the devil has imposed on the populace because it hinders worship in Spirit and Truth that is acceptable to God.</p>

<p>The same thought easily applies to other aspects as well. Do you love the Word of God, or do you just love the way the distinguished old family Bible is displayed in the guest parlor? In other words, do you just love the form of religion and deny the power thereof, or are you drinking deeply of that water that quenches the soul&#8217;s deep thirst?</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_7/I_Had_No_Clue/index.html">&#8220;I Had No Clue&#8221;</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<p>A woman had just shared a little of her background about her childhood and early marriage. She said, &#8220;I had no clue as to how a marriage should work.&#8221; She said it several times&#8212;</p>

<h1>&#8220;I Had No Clue&#8221;</h1>

<p>She was reared by a single mother&#8212;no father figure was in the picture. Her up-bringing had been &#8220;pretty miserable&#8221; according to her.</p>

<p>This situation is multiplied over and over in our land today. In a certain community it has been reported that single mothers form 70% of the population! When the devil succeeds in breaking down homes, the very foundations and walls of protection are removed in their lives, and even more so in the lives of their children. Just like this lady, they have no clue as to how a marriage is to work and be happy.</p>

<p>In the Old Testament the wall of Jerusalem was broken down by enemies.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The gates were burned with fire.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Nehemiah+1%3A3" title="Nehemiah 1:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Nehemiah 1:3)</span></a></span>
A great many of the children of Israel were to blame for the breaking down. Let&#8217;s read the confession:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father&#8217;s house have sinned. We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Nehemiah+1%3A6-7" title="Nehemiah 1:6-7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Nehemiah 1:6-7)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Nehemiah was caught in this situation. His fathers had sinned. He wept and mourned and fasted and prayed. He had a burden to build again that which was broken down. God heard his cry and did make a way for the rebuilding. It looked like an impossible job. They met with many discouraging circumstances. There were enemies to fight. But they persevered and it was accomplished. It is a wonderful, encouraging story. Read the story from the Bible and see for yourself. God worked on the King of Persia to actually let Nehemiah who was his cup bearer go back, and to direct in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem! And, the King also sent funds for the rebuilding! This was an incredible thing.</p>

<p>If you, dear reader, are one of those who &#8220;have no clue,&#8221; and the walls of protection didn&#8217;t exist to protect you, there is hope. Take courage. Like Nehemiah, repent from the bottom of your heart. God will hear your cry and will help you. God is ready to rebuild in your life.</p>

<p>The woman that once had no clue further stated that she had later found out God&#8217;s plan and order for marriage. Her happy countenance revealed the truth she spoke. She had found the wisdom that God has set up for a man and a woman in their distinct differences to live together in peace and harmony.</p>

<p>Are you going to continue drifting down the broken down path or do you want to break the cycle and rebuild the walls of protection for your children and grandchildren? You will be so much happier if you take God&#8217;s plan of wisdom.</p>

<p>I come to you, not as any one superior, but rather just a mere fellow human being who was once full of her own ideas, wants, and ways. As a young teenager the Lord dealt with my heart. There were times that I had told lies to teachers or my parents. There were times in my selfish nature that I fussed with my sister. There were times I took things that were not mine&#8230;. These sins hung over me and I knew I was not ready to meet God, and that I would be lost if I were called into eternity. But the Lord heard my prayer for forgiveness and gave me peace that I was ready to meet Him. It is only by God&#8217;s grace that I am able to obey His word and that I have any thing good to offer you today.</p>

<p>Is the Lord dealing with your heart? I know He loves you. He died for <i>you</i>! He wants to help you. He wants to save you. He wants to change your heart. This is the first step to a happier marriage. This will get you into a place where you can learn how to be a true Christian wife and mother. It is only by being changed by the power of God that women can be like the women in the Bible. It speaks of them being holy women. Holy means Godly. We should ask ourselves, &#8220;Am I living as God requires in His word?&#8221; What then does God require? What is God&#8217;s plan? We pray and trust you are willing to take God&#8217;s plan.</p>

<p>We find God&#8217;s inspiration of a wife for Adam in Genesis 2:18:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And the Lord God said, it is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an <b>help meet</b> for him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+2%3A18" title="Genesis 2:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 2:18)</span></a></span>
So we see here that God&#8217;s plan for wives was to be a helper. Not a ruler, or one to make all the plans, but a helper to assist him in his plans for the family. The word &#8220;meet&#8221; means: admiringly suited, proper, appropriate, apt, fitting.</p>

<p>God could have created a woman the same hour He created a man. We see here God&#8217;s ways are so infinitely planned. One reason perhaps is that God wanted Adam to feel his need. He could always remember the time he felt so alone. Adam could more fully appreciate what God was about to give him. Secondly, we find that God didn&#8217;t just start from scratch again, but opened Adam&#8217;s side and took a rib bone to make a woman. The ways of God hold so much significance. Have you ever thought about why God took a rib bone instead of maybe a bone from his foot or head? The woman was to neither be the &#8220;head&#8221; making all the decisions and rules nor to be &#8220;trampled under foot&#8221; by the man. But she was created to walk by his side from whence she was taken, to be loved and cherished and be a real &#8220;help meet&#8221; to him through life.</p>

<p>In any business or group of people there must be a leader to keep things in order. It doesn&#8217;t work to have two or more leaders. That would be chaos! The same is true in the home. We find in God&#8217;s word that He has set the first of His creation, the man, as the head or leader of the home.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For <b>the husband is the head of the wife,</b> even as Christ is the head of the church.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A23" title="Ephesians 5:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 5:23)</span></a></span>
The final decisions rest upon the husband&#8217;s shoulders. The husband is required to consider his wife, her input, thoughts and needs as we find in I Peter 3:7:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A7" title="I&nbsp;Peter 3:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 3:7)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>You may say, &#8220;My husband doesn&#8217;t make wise decisions.&#8221; Even so, he is still the head and responsible to God for the decisions he makes. If you are to obey God, if you are to be an example to your children, if you are to rebuild the broken wall, if you are to have a happy home, you need to be quiet and pray for him. Resist that temptation to take a hold of the reins and make all those decisions. We women are to submit to our husbands. The Lord has recorded several passages for our profit.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A22" title="Ephesians 5:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 5:22)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+3%3A18" title="Colossians 3:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 3:18)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation [conduct] of the wives; while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A1-2" title="I&nbsp;Peter 3:1-2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 3:1-2)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>You may say, &#8220;He is so slow in making up his mind, I feel compelled to make the decisions myself.&#8221; Or, &#8220;I do not agree with his final decision.&#8221; Or, &#8220;He seems to jump too hastily in matters.&#8221; Or, &#8220;His decisions really scare me!&#8221; Through all these feelings, firmly resist the temptation to assert yourself. If he asks your advice and help, that is fine; but don&#8217;t take the leadership over! You will be robbing your husband of his God-given manhood and the leadership position in which God placed him if you do. We find a godly example in I Peter 3:5-6:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands; Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A5-6" title="I&nbsp;Peter 3:5-6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 3:5-6)</span></a></span>
You can search it out in the Old Testament and find that Abraham, Sara&#8217;s husband, did some very unwise things. He was human and had some fears that led him into problems. But, we find that Sara obeyed him and was in subjection to him. However, we can be sure she was praying, because God had mercy and helped her out of very bad situations more than once. If a husband does make a mistake, it is only going to make it worse for the wife to get in there and try controlling things. Submit yourself to God who is able to control all things and make it all come out right. The scripture said, &#8220;Sara was not afraid with any amazement.&#8221; There are a lot of &#8220;fear nots&#8221; in the Bible. Trust in God, He will be your helper.</p>

<p>Following God&#8217;s plan is a very beautiful picture indeed. Did you really notice what the scripture said? The holy women of old adorned themselves with a meek and quiet spirit, being in subjection! Have you ever thought about how beautiful subjection is? A young, unmarried man once heard a wife say she wouldn&#8217;t do such and such because her husband didn&#8217;t want her to. The young man commented, &#8220;Oh, to have a wife like that!&#8221; Was this not a most becoming adornment?!</p>

<p>Remember, your marriage is in your hands. Wives have a huge impact. If you are having trouble in your marriage, in most cases, by God&#8217;s grace, <i>you</i> can change it around by changing your attitude and manner of conduct. God set up a perfect plan. Will you follow it? It is in your hands whether you help build the walls of protection for your marriage, home and children and the generations following.</p>

<h1>Happiness starts with Mother</h1>

<p>The other day we heard some talks on happiness. One point was to count your blessings when you feel depressed. We can always find someone who is in worse shape than we.</p>

<p>While listening to these talks, it dawned on me that a mother holds much of the happiness of the family in her hands. When the morning starts out with a happy and cheerful mother, the children are bound to absorb some happiness. In turn, it may be passed on to their teacher or other children. Her husband will go to work a happier man, passing some of it on to his boss or fellow workers. It helps make the family more eager to return home in the evening, too.</p>

<p>In our home, we have found that happiness comes from serving the Lord, asking His help and guidance. We have our ups and downs in life, but underneath there is the calm assurance of a higher help.</p>

<p>I feel so sorry for those who have no aim in life, nothing to look forward to each day.</p>

<p>We try to teach our children to appreciate the little things in life. The free things in life offer us so much: A walk in the fields and woods, feeding a baby calf with a bottle, watching an ant colony, keeping a room clean and neat, teaching baby brother to pray, and on and on.</p>

<p>Life gives us so many joys if we will only <i>take</i> them.</p>

<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_7/Childraising/index.html">Childraising</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Childraising</h1>

<p>Strange how life has been designed, isn&#8217;t it? We make our most profound choices when we are least qualified to do so, and then we live with the results. This principle applies to a number of things, including the most serious responsibility we have been given&#8212;the responsibility of our own soul.</p>

<p>It also applies to the training and nurturing of our children. As one person put it, about the time you get qualified&#8212;you&#8217;re out of a job! This somewhat tongue-in-cheek observation contains an accurate insight. We only get one chance to raise our children the best we can. No one gets two chances to raise the same child.</p>

<p>And they are all different&#8212;every child. Each one comes with his/her own recipe, and each parent is a cook, whether we like cooking or not. Some of them are like we are as parents, and some are not. Really not. Since God gives each child a soul, and this soul returns to Him when that individual is finished with this life, it would be very interesting indeed to see how the different personalities are divvied up to different parents Sometimes the first one is the &#8220;hard&#8221; one. Then the others seem easier, or, at least, more congenial. Sometimes the last one is the more challenging, after a sense of complacency has been engendered by the more easily-managed children before. (I am reminded of a father who said, &#8220;If the first one had been like ____ [his youngest and last], there wouldn&#8217;t have <i>been</i> any more!) Surely there are valuable lessons in patience and humility that God tucks away in the trials and tests He measures out to us! May we get a hold of them, and work the trials for the good in them, rather than they just working us!</p>

<p>We live in a time when the great majority are clueless with respect to the insights and skills so necessary for the training and nurture of the young. It is a fulfillment of
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+3%3A1-7">II&nbsp;Timothy 3:1-7</a>,
which informs us &#8220;that in the last days&#8230;. men shall be lovers of their own selves.&#8221; This is more than the ordinary self-centeredness of the carnal heart, for this condition has been universal among unsaved men and women since the fall of man in the Garden of Eden. This scripture speaks of an extraordinary self-centered existence, in which
the natural checks that God instituted to restrain selfishness are discarded (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalms+2%3A3">Psalms 2:3</a>),
and the awful consequences perversely ignored. Because of this, &#8220;perilous times&#8221; are here.</p>

<p>To properly raise the children, it is necessary to have a clear, definite picture of what a proper man or woman should be. More than anything else, this definite, clear understanding of what constitutes good character is completely missing in the ordinary American family today. I say &#8220;family&#8221; with considerable reservation, for most of the combinations we see today are not really families at all&#8212;just people, big and little, living together. Frankly, there is little hope of these slipshod, makeshift, and temporary relationships ever doing much worthwhile or virtuous. What is built is built on such a shifting sand foundation that whatever is built upon it has little chance of even holding together. These people need to humble down before God and the truth of His Word, repent and forsake, and do it God&#8217;s way by His help.</p>

<p>But I am burdened to write for those who are living on a higher plane than mere expediency. My heart goes out to those who are endeavoring to please God and do right, but who are greatly afflicted with the ignorance of the times. The sins of their parents have been renounced and forsaken by these who want to do better than they did, but, &#8220;Where to start?&#8221; How can one recover what was lost for their children? How can one escape the perilousness of these times? Where is the true wisdom (as distinguished from the errors and fables) that pertains to training a child?</p>

<p>People do not have to be saved to raise decent children, but they do have to have the fear of God upon them to a certain extent. They must value and respect morality. They will also find that the exercise of dealing with little carnal minds and hearts will put them way out of their depth if they are honest enough to admit it. Few things have as much capacity to bring us to an end of ourselves if we will let it. Your children will find you out eventually. If you are insisting on virtue in them, your own lack of it will become more glaring if that is your condition. We teach a great deal more by what we are than what we say. We would not advise anyone for a moment to remain in an unsaved condition, much less to tackle the awesome task of training an eternity-bound soul without being a new creature in Christ Jesus. Your child has the best chance of living a worthwhile life and ending up with God in the glory world if you live a really, truly, consistent holy life before him/her by the grace of God.</p>

<p>The baby that comes into the world is inwardly flawed, and this inward condition has the capacity to ruin him and proceeds to do so.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalms+58%3A3" title="Psalms 58:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalms 58:3)</span></a></span>
This condition is universal to mankind; not a single person born of the union of man and woman has escaped it. The child&#8217;s evil heart can be restrained and must be; still, this will not change it. Training and discipline can hold it down, but they will not make the individual different. They may modify his behavior, and this is both desirable and necessary; but they modify it in the actions and in the mind&#8212;not in the heart. This is vital to understand, lest we think we have accomplished more than we actually have when we effectually deal with our child. It is as if God has given us a certain place in the lives of our offspring, but He has also put boundaries on what we can actually accomplish. These boundaries are below what is desperately needed by the child, and help is available; but God has reserved this place to Himself and each individual soul. Good raising has never saved anyone by itself, yet it has a place in preparing the foundation for a person to respond to God and live for Him.</p>

<p>The question naturally rises at this juncture, &#8220;How about those who are raised poorly?&#8221; Or, with no raising? &#8220;Jest grewed up,&#8221; with no training, no oversight, neglected, and abandoned.
God loves everybody. He is not willing that any should be lost (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+3%3A9">II&nbsp;Peter 3:9</a>).
He deals with everyone (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+1%3A9">John 1:9</a>)
and
wants everyone (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+3%3A16%3B+Hebrews+2%3A9">John 3:16; Hebrews 2:9</a>).
So He saves people from all kinds of backgrounds, including the most neglected and sin-cursed. Witness: John Newton. But I think I can safely say, that if Brother John Newton were here talking with us, he would readily agree that he would have found it much easier to live for God if he had been raised to respect authority, had been under the yoke of godly parents, and had learned to exercise his will to attempt to do right when he was young. A person can learn all these things later in life, after his childhood, but they will come much, much harder to him, and there is more of a chance that he will give up and make a failure.</p>

<p>There are the scars, and the things that it would have been better to have never done. There is the damage to others. We are much better off in our lives to live as innocently as possible. When we are not saved, we are much better off to sin as little as possible. It is better to get saved and stop the sinning business, but next best would be to do as little wrong as possible. Sin is bad; sin is a reproach; sin consumes and devours; sin is to be avoided at all cost. If people will not be saved or just haven&#8217;t got saved yet, they and everybody else are better off with as little sinning as possible.</p>

<p>So, this is the foundation principles of a good moral life: a real respect for doing right based upon the reality that we shall all meet God and answer for our lives here, and fear of doing wrong and the consequences thereof.</p>

<p>We need to recognize the seriousness of what is at stake when the childish face looks at us when some issue of right and wrong is before us. I think sometimes that we underestimate how difficult it is for our children to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221; The nature of sin within the unregenerated child makes it so easy to take the wrong way out, i.e., deny everything (lie), and make excuses (dissemble), etc. We need to recognize that a square confronting by the child that he/she is in the wrong, a readiness to make confession and to humble down is a <i>huge</i> moral step of responsibility in the war of right and wrong for his soul. He needs all the assistance that someone older, who understands what is at stake, can give him to do the right thing. Here is where the older helper must assist the child to make his critical step in dealing with the issue at hand.</p>

<p>And it is crucial that somehow the child be brought to deal with it in a manner appropriate for his/her understanding. If it is only imposed (and sometimes it must be for the time being), then we must acknowledge that the benefit is very limited. For if we only police the child and do not convince him that he must police himself, we have not taught him the full truth concerning the matter. Most of all, he must realize that all of us, parents and child alike, are dealing with a higher power and greater issues than just our thoughts and ideas. He must sense and accept (as we must, as well) that to be a human being brings great accountability as well as capabilities. And all this must be done with the clear understanding that he has a God-given right to be a fool, to choose to live for the devil and himself, to break your hearts, and to throw away his life. It is this right to become worthless that makes the choice to do right voluntarily of so much value in the eyes of God. For not a single member of God&#8217;s church serves Him out of compulsion. What a premium our Lord places on voluntary love! The devil drives those in the kingdom of darkness to one shameful deed after another, but Jesus leads His dear children along. They follow.</p>

<p>In the battle of wills between our offspring and ourselves, it is vital that our children lose. They need to lose the battle to do as they please, and they need to thoroughly lose it. They need to lose it because it is best for them to do so. We need to get the grace and the stamina we need to press the battle to the gate. Until confession takes place. Until shame is seen. Until the principle of right at stake is acknowledged. If this doesn&#8217;t happen, we, as parents, must acknowledge that it hasn&#8217;t happened yet and press the battle on. Any cessation must be only for the time being without abandoning the fight. It would be nice if you could get the victory for you and for the child&#8217;s benefit in one day, but that is often not the case. You must love the child too much to give up on him. Too much to abandon him to what is in his heart. You must be tougher than your tough child for his sake; and if you are easy-going and passive by nature, you have great need to cry to Him that is strong for strength.</p>

<p class="verse">Stand up! Stand up for Jesus!<br />The trumpet call obey:<br />Forth to the mighty conflict,<br />In this His glorious day;<br />&#8220;Ye that are men now serve Him&#8221;<br />Against unnumbered foes!<br />Let courage rise with danger,<br />And strength to strength oppose.<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Stand_Up_for_Jesus/index.html" title="Stand Up for Jesus">*</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">In making a really determined effort to lure your family into eating vegetables, you will find that they will respond more readily if the vegetables are appealing in shape. Think of the irresistible charm of vegetables floating like flowers in a Japanese-laquered bowl. The French are also very adept at presentation&#8230;&#8203;they disguise the same old carrots, beans, and potatoes under a mass of impressive modifiers. As printaniere they are spring-grown, young, tender, and thinly sliced&#8230;. As julienne or allumette, they are taller and thinner, about 2 or 3 inches long and 1/8 inch through.</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handiwork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+19%3A1-2" title="Psalm 19:1-2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 19:1-2)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Have you ever spent a day in nature and come forth with a renewed sense of God&#8217;s glory? I have. Many times I have walked down our lane and have marveled at the beauty of the sun-splashed hills, covered with our magnificent firs, all backed by a brilliant blue sky. I often think, &#8220;Who could fail to see the stamp of a Creator&#8217;s hand? Who could ever believe that all this happened by chance?&#8221; And yet, even I as meditate, my self-proclaimed atheist neighbors pass by. They see the beauty too, but what a different perspective! How differently we view the same evening scene!</p>

<p>Often, on the weekend, when I&#8217;m at the coast to get respite from the allergies of the pollen-laden Willamette valley, I sit watching the waves, and again, I&#8217;m awed at God&#8217;s hand. So big, so powerful, so much in control, and yet, for what does He use all this power? God is perfect, His creation reflects His incredible perfection and detail in the most minute areas of His earth. As a monarch or dictator, He would rule perfectly&#8212;we&#8217;d each be given the blessing that marks the beauty of nature unblemished. But He let us go, gave us our free choice, and allowed us&#8212;we who are so imperfect&#8212;to choose. God has absolute control&#8212;He governs the heavens, and they glorify Him, He manages the whole earth, and it magnifies Him, but with us&#8212;there He tied His hands, He did, and gave us our choice. Did you ever think that without humans, this whole earth and heavens would be in complete harmony with God? But rather than force us into His blessings, He gave us our choice.</p>

<p> This thought has come home a bit recently to me. A child I mothered for five years has left in rebellion a few months ago. As I go through my days, I am constantly reminded of the unfinished goals we had set in the future&#8212;blessings she missed. The larger garden space granted her this year, the unfinished scrapbook, books we hadn&#8217;t read, the cherry pie I promised I&#8217;d teach her to make, blessings and memories that never came to pass. Why? It isn&#8217;t because I&#8217;m not here, ready and willing to do it. She left. She walked away. Choices she made alienated her from the blessings of home, a loving &#8220;mother&#8221; figure and family. I&#8217;ve seen her since that time and there is a haunted look in her eyes. Far from the sparkling, bouncy, always joyful child I knew, she is somber, a bit wistful and fiercely independent, walls built high to protect the hurting inside&#8212;the hurt she chose. How full of trouble is her life! How destitute of any blessing or happiness! Yet, it is the life of her choice. It is the life many people choose. It is not mine.</p>

<p>By God&#8217;s grace, dear sisters, I want to choose God&#8217;s ways. I want to go the blessing route. God&#8217;s blessing means everything to me. Recently I went to a home that we had a thought of buying for school grounds. Although the place was lovely and ideal in many respects, God&#8217;s blessings were <i>not</i> there. I felt a great heaviness. That weight did not leave until we had given up the ideal of purchasing the place. It was not God&#8217;s choice. I did not have the blessing upon the consideration of that home.</p>

<p>For some time I have been praying about what God wants me to be doing with my life at this time. There are so many things to do. There is so much work available to do: teaching school, working with the elderly, working with children, simply being a full-time help at home, writing and publishing, music ministries, more schooling and education, preparing for a home of my own, the list goes on and on. Being the type of person I am, I always have a full plate, but the Lord has brought me to understand that is not always a virtuous trait. It is far better to be in the order of the Lord and work in the &#8220;blessing zone.&#8221; That knowledge has been slow in coming; I like to do everything. But I thank God that He has shown me that I can glorify Him only when I surrender myself as much as the heavens are yielded to God&#8217;s absolute control. I want my life to declare the glory of God. I want my life to &#8220;speak&#8221; of God&#8217;s creation. I want to be ruled by Him as the waves of the sea; flowing in the course they have since creation was set in motion, glorifying God, because I&#8217;m simply obeying.</p>

<p>This surrender is blessed. I find that as God streamlines my life, no matter how precious a work seems to me, if it&#8217;s out of the blessing zone He has for me, I must leave it behind, trusting Him to fill the lack. Through this process, it has become apparent that editing <i>Dear Princess</i> falls into this category. God has lifted His blessing in my editing of this section. I still have a burden to write, and will do so as God leads, but my season of being editor is over. Does this leave a gap? Yes. I trust God to fill this place. That is His job, not mine. I must stay in the blessing zone.</p>

<p>I remember when I started, a sunny spring day, six years ago. I didn&#8217;t know most of you; how much richer my life has been for your input! My convictions have been sharpened, tested, measured, made stronger by our discussions, your questions and comments. I appreciate all the things you all have shared, all the letters, articles, phone conversations, money offerings! I&#8217;m sure it isn&#8217;t possible to relate how often your offerings, articles, and letters were answers to prayer! Editing <i>Dear Princess</i> has often been an exercise in faith. Thank you so much to all who have prayed for us laboring in this way. Please continue to pray that God will bless and strengthen those who are still working with this, and that He will supply workers with a burden to publish. There is so much to do! If God wants you here, we&#8217;re waiting for you.</p>

<p>And I&#8217;d appreciate your prayers in what God has me doing now. I&#8217;m teaching school, and working with many unsaved and low-moral people in our area. It is a consuming work and I desire to do just the part God has for me. Please pray that the truth taught to these children and their parents will be effective, and that I will stay in the blessing zone of God&#8217;s perfect will.</p>

<p>I love you all.</p>

<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_7/Gods_Dealings_with_Scorn/index.html">God&#8217;s Dealings with Scorn</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>God&#8217;s Dealings with Scorn</h1>

<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been thinking about scorn.</p>

<p>About the attitude of scorners, and how, all too easily, this attitude comes creeping into me.</p>

<p>Pride and scorn go hand and hand, so I suspect that this problem I see has been around a long time in me, knocking for entrance in my life. However, it wasn&#8217;t until I began teaching that I realized how susceptible I am to scorn.</p>

<p>After God directed my life away from accredited teaching and honor in the public schools, after I saw the blessing in God&#8217;s way, I became more and more critical of public schools, their methods and the products of the education system. I thanked God for my opened eyes; I thanked Him a thousand times as I saw the shabby education children received. I bitterly opposed the lack of one-on-one time for children, and my main criticism centered on this point. They would learn so much more, I contended, if only teachers took the time, had smaller classes, etc., etc. Little did I realize, I was the one who had so much to learn. God knew my heart. He knew how much I needed a lesson in humility. Thus, when I opened school September the 17th, with every high hope in mind for each student, God began my lessons as well.</p>

<p>I was given a child whom I had sized up earlier as a more intellectual child than most her age, as she had a fairly good attention span when it came to books and a thoughtful mind. She had just missed the public school deadline for kindergarten by about a month, and that was the reason she was placed in our school. Her parents were not sympathetic to private schooling and trusted the public school completely – she had just inconveniently missed the deadline. In retrospect, I think my unconscious thoughts were that I was &#8220;going to show them.&#8221; I would teach their child so well that they would be &#8220;forced&#8221; to keep her out of public school unless they were so calloused that they would let her be bored there. On our first conference, I laid out all my grand plans for the coming year for their daughter. They were impressed, but their &#8220;I hope it works for her&#8221; attitude escaped me. I would remember this in time.</p>

<p>I launched forth with all the zeal that only a beginning teacher can ever possess, ready to conquer the world and more, filled with a fire to educate God&#8217;s way and to stay out of the public school system (that old rag) forever. I worked hard; I expected my students to work hard. I built fires constantly to keep them moving. I had one child that was nine, but in the first grade, and I was determined to bring her grade up, and teach her the love of learning. For long months, nothing I did caught fire. I blamed the public school for killing her desire to learn. I blamed them for how behind she was. The neglect she had received was terrible, but I did not realize that to identify an error without humility of mind can create something far worse than the error itself: deadly pride and swollen self-importance.</p>

<p>Back to my new kindergarten student whom I&#8217;ll call &#8220;Carla.&#8221; I taught her <i>Sing, Spell, Read and Write,</i> along with my other students that level, and, although I noted a lack of retention, I felt she was moving just a little slow. Months past, and with each conference, I was not able to report the progress as with other students. I was Carla&#8217;s first teacher; there was no institution to blame for her lack of interest in school or her increasing behind status. She was a normal five-year-old who loved to play, but could simply not remember her lessons. It didn&#8217;t matter how much one-on-one time I spent with her; nothing helped. I cried; I prayed, &#8220;Lord, how? What am I doing wrong? Why isn&#8217;t she learning?&#8221; By December, I was desperate. All my other kindergarten students were reading; Carla could not recognize her alphabet even though she had completed the <i>Sing, Spell, Read and Write</i> program in this area. If she had been a public school student, I would have blamed the situation on not enough one-on-one time or something to that effect, but she was <i>my</i> student, in a small class, getting more attention than <i>anyone</i> else. My grand plans were crumbling; far from any chance of convincing her parents of the value of one-on-one schooling, now I found myself faced with a conference coming wherein I felt I had nothing I could say to her parents. We had made absolutely no progress from the previous month at all.</p>

<p>Devastated, and humbled, I called to arrange for our next conference. The scorn had drained from me; I found I had no criticism left for others. How good God is! He had brought me to my knees, at the end of my rope, all the air drained from my beautiful dream balloon, and then He began to speak, as I humbled myself. With one day left until the conference, He opened up His book of understanding, and gave me afresh His way of teaching Carla&#8212;what she needed, how she needed it. She has some different problems (some signs of dyslexia as did her older siblings), but from that day forward, we&#8217;ve made progress. She has now mastered all but four of the alphabet letters (a miracle for her), and she has her foundation math concepts in place, ready to tackle first grade math.</p>

<p>We all know that God is omniscient and has all understanding, but it amazes me over and over how much there is in God&#8217;s storehouse of wisdom. A rock I slaved to move for months, flees as the clouds in the sky when God gives understanding how to move. In more stories than I could ever write, I have witnessed this over and over again. There is a key to every child and every situation. Without it, you can struggle forever, and get no success. To possess it, gives the only true success of God&#8217;s way. What keeps us from holding this key in our hands? Scorn bars the way many times. Scorn is pride and our way all wrapped up in one package. Scorn blinds our eyes and puffs us up in vain conceit. In short, the seat of the scorner is a very dangerous place. I&#8217;ve heard people speak cynically of the wonderful things that others testify that Jesus has done or given to others, saying that God has never helped them. They struggle alone in their problems, no matter how much they beg for help. They hold not the key! They feel miffed that God does not give His understanding to their problems. There is a cost for the key. We must come to the end of our way, we must be humbled, and then God is more than willing to unlock His treasure store.</p>

<p>Are you willing? The blessings are untold&#8230;.</p>

<p class="verse">Humility, thou secret vale,
<br />Unknown to proud in heart;
<br />Thy show&#8217;rs of blessings never fail,
<br />And glories ne&#8217;er depart.<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Humility/index.html" title="Humility">*</a></p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_7/With_Eagles_Wings/index.html">With Eagles&#8217; Wings</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>With Eagles&#8217; Wings</h1>

<p>The sky darkens and the breeze gathers strength as it tugs at the leaves and branches. Amid the ripples on the pond etched circles appear where the first drops of rain have fallen, soon to be joined by many others when the tempest breaks. Grasses bend low and treetops sway as rivulets of water hurry to the lowlands, while the birds and animals seek refuge under dripping bows. All nature is driven before the storm and pressed low by its fury. All, but one. Mounting high above the lowering clouds and stormy winds flies the eagle. In the golden light of the sun it soars, triumphant.</p>

<p>I stood and watched the rippling grasses, letting the cool wind brush my face and whip at my jacket, feeling the touch of the Creator in the hand of His creation. Though the May afternoon was a brisk one with promise of coming rain, the trials of the day had driven me to seek a refuge in my God. The storm had broken upon me and I needed a shelter&#8230;&#8203;or was it an escape?</p>

<p>Lifting my head I took in the beauty of the gray skies and billowing clouds. Some were dark with rain, but others were edged in silver. Here and there a bright patch of blue had turned all bordering clouds fleecy white: a promise of a bit of golden sunshine somewhere. Swallows dipped and soared above the gray-violet water, seemingly oblivious of the coming shower. When the rain came, turning the pond into dented glass, they would seek shelter&#8212;or perhaps fly up through that opening into the blue heavens.</p>

<p>I looked at the dimmed shape of the sun above the waving treetops. It somehow reflected the dull ache in my heart. The topsy-turvy feelings, the hurts, the burdens, the cares were all bound up in those clouded skies. Somewhere it must be shining brightly. Just beyond those dismal gray thunderclouds there was the shimmering golden sunlight. Then I knew that the swallow&#8217;s choice was mine, too.</p>

<p>Would I seek shelter in self-pity, complaints, and sorrows? I could spill it all out to whoever cared to listen and somehow find some solace in human comfort, under the dripping branches. I could. But what was I standing for anyway? Huddling down when a little gale overwhelmed me didn&#8217;t demonstrate a victorious life. Through Jesus I could soar; with eagle&#8217;s wings I could reach that promised rest. Yes, heavenly sunlight was mine once I reached up to claim it.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the light of God, all, all is bright,&#8221; we sing. &#8217;Tis true, but first we have to look up. The clouds have brightness not seen by many, for it is on the top. Mounting up with eagles&#8217; wings takes an effort&#8212;a seeking of more than the sheltering branches, a defying of the dark clouds about you, a desiring of Heavenly light.</p>

<p>When viewed from the light-crested clouds, the storm indeed shrinks down to proportion. Who am I to complain, after all? Is not my God Lord of the tempest, does He not know what is best? Surely we are called to touch earth and feel its woes and sorrows, but the fury of the storm should always summon us heavenward.</p>

<p>It is when we receive the heavenly vision that we can say with Paul,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; the things which are not seen are eternal.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+4%3A17%2C18" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 4:17,18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 4:17,18)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>This vision is for all that will seek it. It is the way of victory and conquering in this life: the way our Savior tread. Therefore let us now mount up with eagle&#8217;s wings and touch the throne of God.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;I bare you on eagles&#8217; wings, and brought you unto myself.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Exodus+19%3A4" title="Exodus 19:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Exodus 19:4)</span></a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Abigail,</p>

<p>I am a mother of six blessings, ages infant through 10 years. I am also a teacher with credentials and a master&#8217;s degree&#8212;so your article was of great interest to me.</p>

<p>I can speak from my own experience to let you know that I see a real blessing that the Lord is giving you. His firm and loving hand guiding you away from an education degree is a protection! You are being spared vain philosophy and deceit.</p>

<p>I spent six years in the Christian and four years in the public education systems. Sadly, all teacher education programs that are accredited are based on the Greek philosophy of education instead of the Hebrew philosophy&#8212;which is God&#8217;s way! (For more information on these two philosophies, I recommend <i>Assumptions</i> by Christian Oberman.) The damage done to my spiritual life and world view by the highly accredited teacher training I received is grievous to me. I have spent so many hours renewing my mind through scripture and Puritan writings, yet I still struggle daily as I battle with the false mindset I so easily adopted.</p>

<p>As I home educate my own children I must constantly monitor myself; am I relying on my &#8220;knowledge&#8221; or God&#8217;s wisdom? Am I seeking the Lord as to how to teach the child or am I falling back on the teacher training I received?</p>

<p>I also struggle with my lack of preparation in godly homemaking. I did not use the time before marriage and children to learn the skills that should be so easy now. Instead I use a great deal of energy to &#8220;re-mediate&#8221; my lack of knowledge. Strange that even though I gained academic honors and a 4.0 average in my degree, that now I am a remedial student in the subject of real life!</p>

<p>May God bless you as you seek His ways. God&#8217;s plan for your education is one that I pray you will continue to follow:</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Trust in the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, and do good&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+37%3A3-5" title="Psalm 37:3-5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 37:3-5)</span></a></span>; (don&#8217;t fret about the future; He will provide)</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;So shalt thou dwell in the land&#8221;</span> (Just serve where He has you)</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And verily thou shall be fed. Delight thyself also in the Lord&#8221;</span> (make it your top priority, not the accolades or degrees of men)</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And He shall give thee the desires of thine heart. Commit thy way unto the Lord, trust also in Him,&#8221;</span> (not in credentials, teaching, certificates, etc.),</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And he shall bring it to pass.&#8221;</span> (Whatever His good and perfect will is for you. Usually I&#8217;ve found the Lord does things in a way I would have never expected or could have possibly planned.)</p>

<p>My husband and I are blessed to hear how you are serving others as your preparation. This is something we had not thought about before as an option for training our own daughters when they are older. We know the Lord does not have college for our children and are praying He will reveal how we can help them be His servants as adults. Thank you for sharing your story.</p>

<h2>Now I Am No Longer Losing My Mind</h2>
<p>I am a little shy in telling a testimony of mine, but I am sure that God wants it told, at least in part.</p>

<p>I was afflicted with seizures in my head which ranged from not seeing someone across the room, but being able to talk and make movements, to ones that I could not feel coming and would completely knock me out of consciousness. One of these I had once while playing with my flute teacher, and the first thing I knew was that my flute was not in my hands and I was seated upon a chair, my teacher asking me if I were all right. Those made me feel very unsure that I could be relied on, and I could not be confident my brain would behave itself to be trusted very far.</p>

<p>I remember the first one I had, when nine or ten years old, as I was playing a piece for my piano teacher. I told her very proudly that I had not been able to see a little while as I was playing, but had played anyway. She was worried and very concerned. I could not see anything to be concerned about and thought it silly for my parents to think anything serious about it, also.</p>

<p>Years passed and the seizures slowly worsened, and still I passed it off as nothing. As long as I could be outside with fresh air to breathe and had extra sleep I could keep them down and most of the time could fake them off as though nothing unusual had happened. When worse seizures without any warning began to come, I made sure I was always with my mom, and only at home, or close friends&#8217; homes was it &#8220;safe&#8221; to do things by myself.</p>

<p>My parents, grandparents and good family friends prayed for me again and again. Some of the time I was glad, but most of the time I didn&#8217;t care. For I had not kept up my life with Jesus I had received when I was a little girl, and God didn&#8217;t seem very real to me. At times I hoped fervently that none of them would ask me if I were a Christian, for I hated to lie; that was the one thing I could not hardly bear to do. No one ever asked, though, and God did not answer their prayers for healing.</p>

<p>There is a reason God does not answer prayer sometimes. I believe that He refused their heart-felt requests again and again for the reason that I would not be able to leave the home. Later, as I threw away my salvation entirely, I could not leave the preaching, which before had been as a nice song in my ears, but which turned into warnings to sinners, sinners, sinners. That was all I seemed to hear, though I knew that half of the time that was not what the testimony or message was about, I heard only that part. This made me plenty angry, though I kept it to myself. I realized, too, that God had gotten me in a place so I couldn&#8217;t escape: I had to listen, I had to stay with people with which I felt alienated (I had chosen an alien path, right?). I grew more angry and left off trying to do right and follow right things. I choose the way I wanted and as a reward&#8212;for we each receive a reward
(<span class="scripture">&#8220;Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+6%3A2%2C5%2C16" title="Matthew 6:2,5,16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 6:2,5,16)</span></a></span>)&#8212;I was chained to the devil and to the sins of which I could not free myself.</p>

<p>The Lord loved me, He loved me so much. He was not content to let me go untouched. I believe He had seen the rebellion coming after so much cooling off (beware of the cooling off), and that was why I was given the seizures to slow me down. He talked and talked with me, day after day. Often I was in the garden working alone and I would get fed up and nearly shout, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care!&#8221; I would not be reasoned by anything, until He changed the subject. I could not squirm away from His grasp as He made me look at myself, what I would become. I was furious, absolutely furious. I said I would not become that and I would prove to the whole world that one did not have to be a Christian&#8212;most Christians were fake anyway&#8212;to have a nice, happy life. But in about a week, I was convinced otherwise. Very unwillingly I had to face the plain fact that all the good quality I had had was going and there wasn&#8217;t much left. I couldn&#8217;t hold on to it, try as I did. I was convinced; the Voice was right. I didn&#8217;t say so, but I was. All there was left to do was not give in to the patient persuasive Voice that continued to talk to me. I came out of my room one morning, went out of the door into the sweet air of a brand-new morning. The Voice said again as it had said many times, &#8220;Which will you choose?&#8221; And it seemed to echo as an empty hall and as the scripture says, the voice that is as the sound of many waters. &#8220;What are you going to choose? You still have a choice.&#8221; I gave in, my heart stopped kicking. He was right. I said I was tired of fighting. &#8220;Would He,&#8221; I said feebly, without much hope after fighting and kicking at Him for so long, &#8220;if there was any hope, could He talk to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>I had a horrible time getting free from the devil. Nearly all my faith in God was shattered, it seemed to be beyond repair. But I didn&#8217;t want to become the future me I had seen and I wanted to get the rotten, cancerous values out of myself. But I couldn&#8217;t do it. I tried with all I had, but I failed. The devil said, &#8220;You&#8217;ll never be free; were you ever? Just do your best.&#8221; I got very angry at the him and screamed, &#8220;It&#8217;s all your fault, it&#8217;s your fault I&#8217;m here, that I&#8217;m becoming rotten.&#8221; And he would laugh, and chant it back to me, &#8220;It&#8217;s all your fault; you chose me. Aren&#8217;t you happy?&#8221; His laughter would echo, and echo. &#8220;It&#8217;s all your fault; it&#8217;s all your fault.&#8221; There was nothing I could say. Often Mama asked me how I felt, thinking of my head, and I replied I didn&#8217;t feel real well. Guess where I didn&#8217;t feel well. Inside.</p>

<p>At this point, my parents were praying for me, I am certain. It was troubling to anyone who loved the Savior, specially my parents who loved me, that God wasn&#8217;t real to me any longer.</p>

<p>God&#8217;s hand was ready, though invisible to me, to pull me out of the mire, to break off the chains, to remove the spirit that dominated me. One evening my sins were very heavy upon me, and I hadn&#8217;t hardly a hope, it seemed in the world–I had thrown away all the good ones. Nothing was left. I kneeled beside my bed and cried out in the dark, &#8220;Oh, if there is a God up there that can take away these sins and make me clean once again, could You answer me? Is there anyone more powerful than the devil?&#8221; To be clean, clean, all filth washed away was what I wanted. If the God my parents had taught me about didn&#8217;t have it, I wanted to find who did. I squished down the fearful thought that there was no hope and that all people managed to cope successfully. As long as the small hope was there, hope that Someone good was more powerful than the devil that held me fast, I might, perhaps escape.</p>

<p>I have escaped, for which I praise Him, and by His help, won&#8217;t ever stop! The Savior answered that desperate call. He was and still is a good Savior. He has helped me out of the filth, the stinking, tar-like mire that held me. At my earnest pleadings, He removed the love of my sins and then broke the chains that were so strong. A favorite song of mine says, &#8220;The Lion of Judah has broken every chain.&#8221; He broke mine that I could serve Him, fleeing forever my old master.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of [thee]. But [thou] shall serve the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> [thy] God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+30%3A8-9" title="Jeremiah 30:8-9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jeremiah 30:8-9)</span></a></span>
This was the promise I was given, which He has throughly done, proving yet another scripture true,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isiah+55%3A11" title="Isiah 55:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isiah 55:11)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p class="verse">Awake, my soul, to joyful lays,<br />And sing thy great Redeemer&#8217;s praise;<br />He justly claims a song for me,<br />His loving-kindness, oh, how free!<br />Loving-kindness, loving-kindness,<br />His loving-kindness, oh, how free!</p>

<p class="verse">He saw me ruined in the fall,<br />Yet loved me, notwithstanding all;<br />He saved me from my lost estate,<br />His loving-kindness, oh, how great!<br />Loving-kindness, loving-kindness,<br />His loving-kindness, oh, how great!</p>

<p class="verse">Though num&#8217;rous host of mighty foes,<br />Though earth and hell my way oppose<br />He safely leads my soul along,<br />His loving-kindness, oh, how strong!<br />Loving-kindness, loving-kindness,<br />His loving-kindness, oh, how strong!</p>

<p class="verse">When trouble, like a gloomy cloud,<br />Has gathered thick and thundered loud,<br />He near my soul has always stood,<br />His loving-kindness, oh, how good!<br />Loving-kindness, loving-kindness,<br />His loving-kindness, oh, how good!<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Loving_Kindness/index.html" title="Loving-Kindness">*</a></p>

<p>Now that from the very bottom things were righted, my feet planted in the only good path, my heart cleansed and love of false things removed, He began to help me along the true path. I stumbled and struggled, mostly because what I had fooled around with had left scars and unhealed places, which as I discovered and asked for help, were healed and faith in God grew stronger. When I was no longer tempted to look back with favor on my old path, that is, when the temptation was no longer tempting to my heart, He began to talk with me about healing my head.</p>

<p>I had stupidly decided that God had no interest there, since He had been and still was very intent upon my heart being right and correct with the heavenly way. I responded unenthusiastically, feeling that I was fine, I could deal with having seizures. But God said, Perhaps you can, but you cannot deal with the devil. What? With the devil? I thought I was freed from him. But he was laying ground work for another victory.</p>

<p>I would get very depressed because of the extra work I caused, how other people didn&#8217;t understand why I didn&#8217;t feel safe except around my parents and a very few others. My seizures caused my parents to be sad, and beside that, I could tell the seizures were getting worse at a quick pace; I could no more predict when one would happen than change into a different person, physically. Often I wished I could die to free the others up, so they wouldn&#8217;t have to bear me any longer. So I when I asked what He meant by not being able to deal with the devil, He showed me a scripture Isaiah had written,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+54%3A14" title="Isaiah 54:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 54:14)</span></a></span>
The word oppression stood out as though it had suddenly become three-dimensional, as did the words, fear, and terror. Yes, I was afraid nearly all the time and terror would jump on me without warning. And as for oppression, I had it all right. Does God oppress His children? No, He does not. And so I understood that, though God had put it on me to work His will then when I was out on my own and not in His fold, if it was not gotten rid of now, it would be the cause of my downfall. The devil could now use it to discourage and depress me until I would lose sight of heaven once more, forever perhaps.</p>

<p>I quickly chose, and I chose the righteous side in spite of all the whisperings that I was not worth it, hadn&#8217;t I done so many wrong things in the past?&#8230;&#8203;Why did I think God loved me anyway? Then the devil got mad. He said I&#8217;d be sorry and left. Tremblingly, I felt for the comfort of my Savior&#8217;s hand&#8212;just in time, for temptations like I&#8217;d never felt before came boiling over me. I couldn&#8217;t see, hear, or feel God&#8217;s promises. I thought that this surely must be what it is to fall in to the Devil&#8217;s Churn, which is an deep, open crevass, thirty feet long and two or three feet across which runs inland from the sea on the Oregon coast. When our family had visited it, I had stood beside the narrow crack watching as the tide ran in, dashing this way and that, and toward the end, being sucked under, perhaps in a deeper hole, with an awful sound.</p>

<p>If you will choose the right, when faced with the fury of the devil, there isn&#8217;t much he can do. If you die, he will have lost you. If you live, he will lose, too. So don&#8217;t give in; hold on to the good God&#8217;s given you and the storm will have to clear. Maybe not immediately, but God &#8220;knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations&#8221; and will do it if you will not turn from Him. God helped me, though I could not tell He was there, and I held on to Him by His help. The devil finally left, and I felt as limp as a piece of wet seaweed. But the seaweed felt glad!</p>

<p>Thus I went through the lessons, God helping me, giving grace and needed understanding and teaching me how to pray for things I could see I needed.</p>

<p>Very carefully I thanked Him for each relief, each little blessing that pointed to the fulfillment of the promise to be far from the devil&#8217;s oppression, and the fear and terror that always accompanied it. The devil spoke reasonably that wasn&#8217;t this enough, to be able to call for relief and receive it? I replied that it was too dangerous to not want all the promise done and finished, and after I had told my Savior about it, the devil fell silent.</p>

<p>I was greatly afraid of presuming a healing finished, and it proving to be not completed. If this happened, I feared I could be easily captured by my enemy again. So I told my Savior about it, though He already knew, and said that I believed He was working on healing me, and asked that He would let me know when it was completed and that the devil would know, too, so he could not bother me about it.</p>

<p>I had a friend up in Canada with whom I felt safe. She had invited me to come with her and a group of friends to visit China Town in Vancouver, British Columbia. It would be a lot of walking (a lot of energy expended) and so I marked in my mind to take along some favorite dried fruits and nuts to keep my head from going completely out. (If I got hungry, and didn&#8217;t get some sort of food in ten or fifteen minutes, I could just count on having trouble.) Well, I forgot. Totally forgot. You know, sometimes, God helps us forget on purpose! When we started out from the car, I felt hungry, and remembering then the food I had forgotten to bring, I told the Lord, &#8220;Just please don&#8217;t let me be a problem for them after they have so kindly let me come.&#8221; He quietly replied, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry.&#8221; We walked an hour through the shops, looking and exclaiming over the unusual things we saw. Then we had to retrace our steps. That hour going back was for me a heavenly hour. I did not have one seizure, though I was so hungry, I should have had a dozen. My head was not faint, and my heart–my heart was full of praise. It seemed that Jesus was stepping along beside me, and the devil was gone. Surely God had done something marvelous; He had done a miracle for me. I could hardly believe it, yet there it was–shown so plainly that the devil had not room to suggest anything. Isn&#8217;t God good? Don&#8217;t we have a wonderful Savior?
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherefore thou art great, O L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Samuel+7%3A22" title="II&nbsp;Samuel 7:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Samuel 7:22)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p class="verse">I serve a risen Savior,<br />He&#8217;s in the world today.<br />I know that He is living,<br />Whatever men may say.<br />I see His hand of mercy,<br />I hear His Voice of cheer;<br />And just the time I need Him,<br />He&#8217;s always near.</p>

<p class="verse refrain_line">Refrain:</p><p class="verse refrain">He lives, He lives;<br />Christ Jesus lives today.<br />He walks with me, and talks with me,<br />Along life&#8217;s narrow way.<br />He lives, He lives,<br />Salvation to impart!<br />You ask me how I know He lives?<br />He lives within my heart.</p>

<p>As I wrote at the top of this testimony, I was very shy in letting a part of the precious treasure go to print where perhaps a thousand eyes would see it; some would be offended at it, to others it would be lovely song without real meaning, but I pray that some may find what God had in mind for them. I have given my part&#8212;may God give the rest.</p>
