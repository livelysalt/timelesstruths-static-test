<h1>Parent and Child</h1>

<p class="author">Anonymous</p>

<h2>I</h2>
<p class="verse">Once a child, now child&#8217;s come,<br />To the time the childhood&#8217;s done.<br />Grown to be a child no more,<br />Decision knocks upon life&#8217;s door.<br />Each young lion seeks a bride,<br />To bring forth his crowning pride;<br />And every mourning dove, it seems,<br />Seeks the husband of her dreams.<br />Now a couple, young and strong,<br />Seeks to find a place among<br />All the partnerships of earth,<br />Where they may, through loving birth,<br />Strike a note (a living chord),<br />Bring forth a child blest of the Lord.<br />Behold the joy the bosom feels<br />When child&#8217;s life is first revealed!<br />Once a twinkle, faith alone could see,<br />Is now a blest reality.<br />And notice Parent full of pride,<br />The warmth of joy so deep inside<br />Comes bursting forth in radiant love<br />And praise to God the King above.</p>

<h2>II</h2>
<p class="verse">But soon after that, joy will lack,<br />As child becomes accepted fact.<br />Child&#8217;s novelty soon wears away,<br />His presence occupies each day.<br />He who once was a joy to care<br />Becomes a burden hard to bear.<br />Child&#8217;s naughtiness is soon revealed,<br />His innocence so soon repealed.<br />Did Parent actually believe,<br />Was Parent possibly deceived<br />To thinking that sweet child would<br />Be sweet, innocent, and always good?<br />Could Parent have been unaware<br />In helpless child, lurking there,<br />Were seeds of wrath, by nature laid,<br />Hidden since child first was made?<br />Poor Child, he was not to blame<br />For Adam&#8217;s sin within his frame,<br />&#8217;Twas given him without a choice,<br />He couldn&#8217;t raise rejecting voice.<br />So, as was custom of his clan,<br />Parent followed their master plan.<br />Poor Child, with sin original,<br />Was brought to the Baptismal;<br />And there the priest declared sin dead<br />By pouring water on Child&#8217;s head.<br />Yet this could not destroy that pest,<br />But wash Child&#8217;s head alone, at best.<br />That fiend remained in Child&#8217;s heart,<br />Child&#8217;s misery was soon to start.<br />And so that root, it sought always<br />A chance to go on bold display,<br />A chance to raise its ugly head,<br />Refuse the right, do wrong instead.</p>

<h2>III</h2>
<p class="verse">So Parent and Child grew side by side,<br />The gulf between them growing wide.<br />Each thought alone his way was right,<br />They battled on through many nights.<br />A rod of pride did Parent wield;<br />Stern child yet refused to yield.<br />Poor Parent in his clumsy way<br />Hoped Child would understand and say:<br />&#8220;Yes, yes, I see you seek my good,<br />You treat me as you think you should.&#8221;<br />But Child, so slow to comprehend,<br />Refused time and again to bend.<br />Grim discipline, he could not bear,<br />Child thought hard Parent did not care.<br />Child did not understand nor know,<br />Poor Parent tried his love to show.<br />He hoped to form his child like him,<br />But Child esteemed this hope as dim.<br />(This child had brethren who before<br />Had yielded unto Parent&#8217;s roar.<br />For fear of punishment they ran<br />And quick obeyed his each command.<br />Now with them Parent did delight,<br />They neither did resist nor fight,<br />But meekly bowed to his control,<br />A thing well pleasing to his soul.)<br />But this child came of different stock.<br />Parental bellows failed to rock<br />Child with his spirit free and grand;<br />And Parent could not understand.<br />Thus Child, through rebellious tone,<br />Spent much of childhood alone.<br />He couldn&#8217;t relate with brethren meek;<br />Help from Parent he&#8217;d never seek;<br />Too proud to ask of or confide,<br />Child bottled up all things inside.<br />Child&#8217;s shell-like outside never failed<br />To keep his fragile inside veiled.<br />Thus Child struggled and suppressed<br />The longing deep within his breast,<br />And staunchly fought and held his ground<br />When Parent threw his orders &#8217;round.<br />As warriors in a battle sore,<br />When deep engaged in bloody war,<br />Gain mutual respect and fear,<br />So Parent and Child through strife drew near.<br />Though each maintained his way was right<br />And laboured on with all his might,<br />Both hoped the storm of war would cease<br />And that they&#8217;d find that unknown peace.<br />But warfare lingered long and cruel.<br />His brethren thought Child a fool.<br />As years of conflict pressed the gate,<br />In Child sprang up bitter hate.<br />The fight, Child never would concede,<br />So mounting his subconscious steed,<br />Retreating to his secret den,<br />(where Parent could not hurt again),<br />The one place Parent could not find:<br />The deep recess of Child&#8217;s mind.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>
<p class="verse">For many years, Child hid in there,<br />Oblivious to Parent&#8217;s care,<br />Exploring every hidden thing.<br />In Child&#8217;s hideout, Child was king.<br />Here Child threw off every net<br />Placed by Parent he&#8217;d soon forget.<br />And now, with every stop removed,<br />With no more Parent to reprove,<br />Poor Child started on the path<br />That nearly brought him quick to death.<br />The roots were laid for sin&#8217;s career.<br />In Child&#8217;s mind, his plan was clear.<br />He walked the wild side of life,<br />Forgetting all Parental strife.<br />He swam in liquor&#8217;s murky pools,<br />In Child&#8217;s world, Child made the rules.<br />He followed every fleshly thought,<br />Dark carnal lust alone he sought.<br />He tried tobacco&#8217;s Stygian smoke,<br />To further smash Parental yoke.<br />Wild Child ran from sin to sin,<br />Suppressing growing guilt within.<br />Then sin, through long continuance,<br />Became the lord for whom Child danced.<br />While sin appeared as sociable,<br />Poor Child grew uncontrollable.<br />For Child by force had been dethroned,<br />As sin became king all alone.<br />Yes, Child was forced, sin to obey,<br />no longer choosing his own way.<br />He&#8217;d tried the road of sin and found<br />His hopes came tumbling to the ground.<br />Oh, how he longed for former days,<br />When his free spirit, then ablaze,<br />Would challenge all authority,<br />Refuse to bend a humble knee,<br />Unflinching &#8217;neath the threatening wave,<br />Displaying blazing courage, brave!<br />Now, in defeated misery,<br />Forced to concede the victory,<br />Held fast by sin&#8217;s infernal mire,<br />Was Child – bound for eternal fire.<br />And Parent in the shadow stood,<br />Unable to help if he could,<br />For Child turned his back on him,<br />The bond between stretched paper thin.<br />Their years of war in Child bred,<br />A heart of stone, a conscience dead.<br />(Wonder if Parent ever came<br />To realize he was part to blame?)</p>

<h2>V</h2>
<p class="verse">Yet, if we&#8217;ll strain, in Child we&#8217;ll see<br />A tiny spark of honesty.<br />For years, &#8217;twas hid from mortal sight,<br />But Jesus, in His holy might,<br />Had recognized Child&#8217;s true desire<br />And fanned that spark to burning fire.<br />He caught Child on the downward slope<br />And filled his heart with living hope.<br />There Jesus sent two angels in,<br />Whose words convinced Child of his sin.<br />They spoke of heavenly things above,<br />Detailed a Savior&#8217;s precious love;<br />They cried, &#8220;Faith is the Victory&#8221;,<br />The Word of Life the holy key,<br />By whose example Child was sure<br />That Jesus was his only cure.<br />Now Child, engulfed in gloomy woe,<br />Contested with a greater foe.<br />No longer wishing Sin to serve,<br />His protest did that king unnerve.<br />There Hell recoiled with all its might,<br />And threw its fierceness to the fight;<br />Unwilling to let Child go,<br />Its fiery darts more swift did throw.<br />And each time Child seemed to gain,<br />Sin fought the more, king to remain.<br />Child&#8217;s past parental war seemed bliss;<br />Seemed child&#8217;s play, compared to this.<br />In trying to break sin&#8217;s control,<br />Child warred for his immortal soul.<br />Child found that sin, once his delight,<br />Had chained and bound him choking tight.<br />Days, weeks, months, and years did flee,<br />Each closer to eternity.<br />Poor Child with bitter disgrace<br />And bleak despair across his face,<br />Was tempted, as sin would entreat,<br />To quick accept his sure defeat.<br />And oft Child nearly gave in,<br />nearly declared the victor: Sin.<br />But Jesus, bless His holy name,<br />Kept hope alive in Child&#8217;s frame,<br />Not willing that Child be lost<br />Since He had paid such awful cost.<br />He longed to set Child&#8217;s path aright;<br />In His blood, wash Child&#8217;s garments white.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>
<p class="verse">So Child, in anguish deep and loud,<br />This same child who once was so proud,<br />Came bowing low at Jesus&#8217; feet,<br />For full salvation did entreat;<br />And Jesus, faithful to His word,<br />When Child&#8217;s humble cry was heard<br />Sent glowing peace to Child&#8217;s soul;<br />In that great moment, Child was whole.<br />Oh, how dear Child&#8217;s spirit danced,<br />Aglow with God&#8217;s deliverance.<br />Joy permeated every nerve,<br />A joy Child never did deserve.<br />For he, who was so dead, had been<br />Miraculously born again.<br />He sat now in a heavenly place,<br />Peace and contentment on his face,<br />And from this lofty spirit plane,<br />Reviewed his past as dead and vain.<br />The sin, he once blindly enjoyed,<br />By Jesus&#8217; power, had been destroyed.<br />While pondering this precious find,<br />Rejected Parent came to mind.<br />All hate and wrath now purged away,<br />Child sought dear Parent night and day.<br />A song of joy could Child sing,<br />A ray of hope to Parent bring.<br />Child, sure that Parent would desire,<br />The warmth of Christ&#8217;s refining fire,<br />Declared the miracle within,<br />That Jesus saves and keeps from sin.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>
<p class="verse">Now, Parent had religion, too,<br />And was devoted through and through.<br />Each Sunday found him on his knees,<br />Other six found him as he pleased.<br />Did his God not require much,<br />Just now and then to keep in touch?<br />Did God say do the best you can,<br />And I&#8217;ll accept you in the end?<br />There seemed no need to read God&#8217;s word,<br />He seemed content with what he heard.<br />Parent would not investigate<br />The words he heard the priest relate.<br />Like his parents, and theirs before,<br />He clung to their tradition lore.<br />And all this, Child understood,<br />For Child, too, in childhood,<br />Devoutly followed Parent&#8217;s lead,<br />Adopting his religious creed.<br />For every Sunday, Child, too,<br />Would occupy his special pew<br />And listen as the priest would tell<br />Their set way of escaping Hell.<br />But one thing bothered Child then,<br />One gnawing question deep within,<br />He&#8217;d heard about a God above<br />Whose special attribute was love.<br />In worship Parent would proclaim<br />And call himself by Jesus&#8217; name,<br />Yet Child often wondered hard<br />At family life, so battle-marred.<br />If God were love, and they were His,<br />Then why did so much war exist?<br />Child couldn&#8217;t figure out nor see<br />What caused this inconsistency.<br />Did Parent actually believe&#8230;&#8203;<br />Was Parent possibly deceived&#8230;&#8203;<br />In thinking the whole problem lay<br />With Child&#8217;s refusal to obey?<br />Could not the God, whom Parent served,<br />Supply the grace to calm his nerves?<br />Why did he waste such energy<br />By fighting to gain loyalty?<br />Could he not have by secret prayer<br />Approached God with his every care?<br />Poor Child felt Parent&#8217;s fury burn,<br />But children by example learn.<br />In Child, blame in part did lay;<br />He willingly would disobey,<br />But Parent was to blame in part,<br />Forgetting from the very start,<br />The Bible rule on Child&#8217;s behalf,<br />&#8220;Fathers, provoke them not to wrath.&#8221;</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>
<p class="verse">But now willing to lay aside<br />The differences which did divide,<br />Child, beaming out his new-found peace,<br />Knew in his heart that war had ceased.<br />So sure was Child, as told before,<br />That Parent would with joy explore<br />This Canaan land of liberty,<br />Of record clean and conscience free.<br />All full of love, Child drew near,<br />Declaring truth in Parent&#8217;s ear,<br />But Parent, much to Child&#8217;s dismay,<br />Paid little heed to all he&#8217;d say.<br />Poor Parent! He was satisfied<br />That Child was wrong again and cried,<br />&#8220;I have religion and will stay<br />Devoted &#8217;til my dying day.&#8221;<br />Up, up, the shield of blind defense,<br />Gird up thy loins, with ignorance,<br />Take superstition&#8217;s crooked blade;<br />Again through force, try to persuade.</p>

<h2>IX</h2>
<p class="verse">And so it seemed that fate had sealed<br />These warriors to the battlefield.<br />But clashing in a bloodless fray,<br />Unlike the wars of yesterday,<br />Strong Child attacks in godly fear<br />And loves his foe and holds him dear.<br />Unlike the wars of yesterday,<br />When selfish Child sought his own way,<br />He battles now for truth and right,<br />And labours in Jehovah&#8217;s might.<br />So full is Child of confidence<br />With God&#8217;s own word as his defense,<br />Child hurls shots at Parent&#8217;s wall,<br />The force of which prepare its fall.<br />Parent&#8217;s religion cannot stand<br />The light of Heaven&#8217;s master plan;<br />For though her edifice is grand,<br />She&#8217;s built on ever shifting sand.<br />And though for years, she&#8217;s made her boast<br />Of holding sway o&#8217;er heaven&#8217;s host,<br />Her history, inscribed with blood,<br />Shows not the love of Holy God.<br />And Child, beholding Parent&#8217;s face,<br />Can sense a lack of saving grace.<br />Each challenge Child can prepare<br />Is met with hollow, empty stare.<br />Poor Parent, by his silence shows,<br />That deep inside, he surely knows:<br />He may be wrong. He may be lost.<br />Pride carries such an awful cost.<br />Is Parent making big mistake?<br />Won&#8217;t he consider for soul&#8217;s sake?<br />Why will he stubbornly ignore<br />The Word of God when brought before?<br />Young Child has weighed the evidence,<br />Given both sides an equal chance,<br />Can by the power of heaven&#8217;s might,<br />Declare which of the two is right.<br />But Parent cannot make that claim,<br />And Parent is alone to blame.<br />For he has been endowed from birth<br />With intellect of precious worth.<br />And he does willingly refuse<br />The Holy Volume to peruse.<br />If he be lost eternally,<br />&#8217;Twill be his fault exclusively.</p>

<h2>X</h2>
<p class="verse">So Child, by night, and every day,<br />Fervently ceases not to pray<br />That Parent may be reconciled,<br />First unto God, then unto Child.<br />But as for Child, he&#8217;ll never cease<br />His upward trek for Heaven&#8217;s peace.<br />For though his Parent he holds near,<br />Child&#8217;s God and Christ remain more dear.<br />If Child had to choose between,<br />He&#8217;d choose the Parent never seen,<br />For He&#8217;s true Father, He above,<br />Who saved Child by His boundless love,<br />Who washed away confusion&#8217;s mist,<br />And gave Child purpose to exist.<br />Yet love for Parent, Child will keep,<br />A love through bitter years grown deep;<br />&#8217;Tis love expressed for Parent&#8217;s soul,<br />In hopes, to God, he&#8217;ll give control.<br />So, toiling on in endless prayer,<br />Child hopes that Parent will prepare.<br />Oh blessed thought, there reconciled,<br />Saved Parent and his lowly Child,<br />Together at Jehovah&#8217;s throne<br />In Heaven&#8217;s blessed endless home.</p>
