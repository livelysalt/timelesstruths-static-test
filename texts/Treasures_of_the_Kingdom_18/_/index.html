<h1>Great-Aunt Irma&#8217;s Gift</h1>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a package from Great-Aunt Irma,&#8221; Chad said, laying a cardboard box on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s it for?&#8221; asked Rosie, as Mother began cutting the tape.</p>

<p>Daniel peered over her shoulder and read aloud: &#8220;To Danny, Rosie, and Emma Coleman.&#8221; The box contained two books and one little package marked &#8220;for my dear grand-nephew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I guess this must be for you,&#8221; Mother said, handing it to Daniel with a smile. With careful fingers he removed the wrapping and pulled out a silver box with &#8220;Sheaffer Pen&#8221; printed on it. Inside, under a piece of paper, was a silver and green pen with a golden clip. Daniel could only stare at it with shining eyes, but Rosie was impatient.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it out and see how it works. What does the paper say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel took out the paper. One side of it had printing and the words: &#8220;How to fill a Sheaffer Lever-Filler.&#8221; On the other side Great-Aunt Irma had written: &#8220;I found this while cleaning out my desk drawers. It belonged to your great-grandfather and I thought you should have it since you bear his name. Your family is so delightful and well mannered. Do take time to write us sometime. With love, Great-Aunt Irma.&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_18/gift_daniel.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="309" /></div>
<p>Carefully Daniel picked up the pen and looked at it. His own name stared back at him: <i>Daniel Coleman</i>. Under the cap he found that the pen was tipped with a square metal piece. It was shiny gold. &#8220;How does it write?&#8221; he asked in surprise.</p>

<p>Chad looked at the instructions. &#8220;It&#8217;s an old-fashioned fountain pen&#8212;you have to dip it in ink and pull up this lever to fill it. Let&#8217;s try it out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I try it, too?&#8221; Rosie asked, eagerly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll share my book with you. It is all about sea animals.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel didn&#8217;t answer. It was a very special pen and he didn&#8217;t want to share. &#8220;It might get wrecked if everyone tries it,&#8221; he said aloud. &#8220;I&#8217;m just going to use it for special occasions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother came in with a small jar of ink and some paper. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you try it out writing Great-Aunt Irma a thank-you letter,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It was really kind of her.&#8221; She looked straight at Daniel. &#8220;Especially when you didn&#8217;t deserve it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel&#8217;s cheeks grew pink. He remembered how naughty he had been on that visit last summer. Now he could make it right about those gumdrops&#8212;he would write Great Aunt Irma right away.</p>

<p>Rosie watched as Chad helped him fill up the pen. The tip was dipped into the ink and a little lever lifted on the side and sucked it up. At first the pen sputtered and left dark blotches when he wrote. Daniel was persistent, and soon he was making smooth lines easily. He tried not to notice Rosie&#8217;s watchful eyes as he printed:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_18/gift_letter.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="222" /></div>
<p>Daniel paused. How should he tell her about taking the gumdrops? She had thought he was a good little boy who never was bad. It would be easier not to say anything. Besides, she was going to give them the gum drops anyway. But Jesus would want him to tell.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to say now?&#8221; Rosie asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing. I&#8217;m going to finish it later.&#8221; Without looking up Daniel capped the pen and put it back in the little silver box. He gathered everything up and tucked them away in his desk for safekeeping. Maybe he would feel like finishing the letter later.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>That night, while he sat with the family in devotions, Daniel wasn&#8217;t paying much attention. He was thinking of the wonderful pen that had belonged to his great-grandfather. Grandfather had lived in England and had been a secretary in the army during World War I, Daddy had said. Daniel imagined the far places and fierce fights his pen had gone through. It was very valuable&#8212;he would have to take good care of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of treasures do <i>we</i> have?&#8221; Dad&#8217;s question broke into Daniel&#8217;s thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have a nice house, food, and clothes, and furniture,&#8221; suggested Irene.</p>

<p>&#8220;And my dolls and toys,&#8221; little Emma said.</p>

<p>&#8220;My new pen is really special,&#8221; said Daniel, &#8220;&#8217;cause it belonged to great-grandfather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have many treasures,&#8221; Dad agreed, &#8220;but what did Jesus tell us in the verses we read?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to lay up treasures on the earth, where they will get ruined and stolen, but to lay up treasures in heaven,&#8221; said Chad.</p>

<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Lay up&#8217; means to store and keep carefully,&#8221; Dad explained. &#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t we put a lot of importance on our treasures here?&#8221; Everyone was quiet. Daniel was thinking about his pen, his very special, valuable pen. <i>I&#8217;m not going to let it get ruined or stolen,</i> he told himself.</p>

<p>Mom finally spoke up. &#8220;Because Jesus said that <span class="scripture">&#8216;where your treasure is, there will your heart be also,&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+6%3A21%3B+Luke+12%3A34" title="Matthew 6:21; Luke 12:34"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 6:21; Luke 12:34)</span></a></span>&nbsp;&#8221; she said softly. &#8220;If we focus on keeping these things safe, we will lose the eternal treasures.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel didn&#8217;t have much to say at prayer time. <i>What treasures will I lose if I keep my pen safe?</i> he thought. <i>It is mine and no one said I had to share it.</i> &#8220;What about Jesus?&#8221; a voice seemed to whisper. &#8220;He wants you to love others more than yourself. Are you going to obey Him?&#8221; Daniel frowned. <i>I know I should, but I don&#8217;t feel like it. I want that pen to be mine.</i> &#8220;And do you want to be the old, selfish Daniel again?&#8221; the voice asked. <i>No, but&#8230;.</i> With a sigh he pushed the troubled thoughts away and went to bed.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>&#8220;For writing today I want everyone to finish their thank-you letters,&#8221; Mom said the next morning. Daniel slowly pulled out his paper and pen box. The silver and green barrel felt wonderfully smooth in his hand and he was just uncapping it when Rosie came by.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Daniel! Could I please use your pen for the front of my card? I&#8217;ll be very careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m using it right now,&#8221; he said with a scowl. But he stared at the letter a long time before he started to write: &#8220;When I was at your house I took som gum drops. I am sorry becus&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_18/gift_pen.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="146" /></div>
<p>He stopped. <i>How can I say that I&#8217;m sorry and inside be mean and selfish about the pen?</i> Daniel was not one bit happy. The ink had run out and made a dark blot and he suddenly felt like throwing the old pen. <i>It&#8217;s true about the treasure,</i> he thought. <i>Everything is wrong because of this stupid pen.</i> He remembered how happy he had been when Jesus had helped him do the right thing. Daniel knew what he must do. He bowed his head to ask Jesus for help.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rosie?&#8221; He stood by her desk with the silver box. &#8220;You can use my pen if you want,&#8221; Daniel said with determination. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show you how it works.&#8221;</p>

<h1>True Treasures</h1>

<p>When we talk about treasures, we talk about things that are special and valuable. It is a treasure when we want to keep it safe and not lose it. It is a treasure because it brings us happiness or comfort for a while. When you are little your favorite bear or blanket may be your treasure. As you get bigger, you think of more important things&#8212;special gifts, money, and people. But do these things last a long time?</p>

<p>Jesus tells us that true treasures are things that last forever. How can anything last forever? It can&#8217;t be things we see, or people we know. Those things fall apart, get old, or die. The Bible says that this whole world will burn up one day. True treasures come from heaven. They are not things we can see or touch. But they are the most valuable things we can ever have. Do you know what they are?</p>

<p>In the story Daniel learned about one of these treasures. It is called peace. When Daniel was doing what was right and choosing Jesus&#8217; way, he had a good feeling inside. He knew God was happy with him. But when he started thinking about keeping things to himself, he wasn&#8217;t happy any more. What happened? He let a robber steal his peace! The robber was Selfishness.</p>

<p>There are many robbers that try to steal our true treasures. They cheat us and trade the true treasures for false ones. Selfishness made Daniel think that a pen was really worth a lot and that he should not share it with Rosie. He didn&#8217;t listen to Jesus&#8217; whisper to watch out, so he lost his peacefulness. He only had a pen and wasn&#8217;t happy at all. Was it a good trade? No. Remember always to listen to Jesus and keep the true treasures safe.</p>

<p>The animal friend we will think about today is a long-legged baby. You&#8217;ve seen pictures of it, with big ears, wide eyes, and a black nose. Just maybe you&#8217;ve had a chance to see the spotted little creature in the woods with its mother. But you probably won&#8217;t ever see it curled up in its forest bed. It lies so still you would never see it. For our favorite friend is</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_18/fawn_tracks.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="179" /></div>
<h1>The Hidden Fawn: Meekness</h1>

<p>The fawn is a very obedient baby animal. If you could watch it all day long, you might be surprised. For long hours it must lie quietly while mother deer goes off to eat. That is just one reason we call it &#8220;Meekness.&#8221; If ever it is frightened or in trouble, it just falls into a spotted heap and doesn&#8217;t move. The dull brown and white fur is God&#8217;s way of hiding it. Besides blending right into the leaves and grass, it has another special secret. A fawn has no scent! When a hungry wolf or mountain lion goes sniffing for supper, it will pass right by the fawn without even knowing it.</p>

<p>How can we be like the lovely gentle fawn? We can learn to listen and obey, without asking &#8220;why?&#8221; If the fawn asked &#8220;why?&#8221; instead of lying down quietly, what might happen? God has given us parents to take care of us. Learning to obey quickly is <i>meekness</i>. Jesus was like that, too. He obeyed when He was a small boy, and He obeyed when He was grown up. He listened to God, His Father, and did His will, even when He had to die.</p>

<p>Another thing to remember is how the fawn lies down so still and small when there is trouble. When there is trouble you may want to blame others or defend yourself. God wants us to be humble, and not think we are always right. Would it help if the fawn stood up tall and stomped its feet? Of course not! A wolf could kill it easily with one chomp. It is only by staying low down that it is safe. God will protect us and help us if we stay low down. He says that His strength works best in our weakness and smallness. We are just little, but God is big enough for every problem.</p>

<p>The hidden fawn is beautiful. The Bible says for us to have our lives hidden away in God. Let us remember the lesson. How much better if we are not seen or heard at all!</p>

<h2>The Bird&#8217;s Lesson</h2>
<p class="verse">A little bird, with feathers brown,
<br />Sat singing on a tree;
<br />The song was very soft and low,
<br />But sweet as it could be.</p>

<p class="verse">And all the people passing by
<br />Looked up to see the bird
<br />Whose singing was the sweetest
<br />That ever they had heard.</p>

<p class="verse">But all the bright eyes looked in vain,
<br />For birdie was so small,
<br />And, with a modest, dark brown coat,
<br />He made no show at all.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Dear Papa,&#8221; little Gracie said,
<br />&#8220;Where can this birdie be?
<br />If I could only sing like that,
<br />I&#8217;d sit where folks could see.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;I hope my little girl will learn
<br />A lesson from that bird;
<br />And try to do what good she can&#8212;
<br />Not to be seen nor heard.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;This birdie is content to sit
<br />Unnoticed by the way,
<br />And sweetly sing his Maker&#8217;s praise,
<br />From dawn to close of day.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;So live, my child, to do some good,
<br />Let life be short or long;
<br />Though people may forget your looks,
<br />They&#8217;ll not forget your song.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grandpa, I can&#8217;t see why Jessica doesn&#8217;t talk to me anymore,&#8221; Alice said. &#8220;Her dad doesn&#8217;t believe in God, and he didn&#8217;t like us learning Bible verses together, but&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grandpa smiled sadly. &#8220;It has happened before. Shall I tell you a story? It is called</p>

<h1>The Weeping Prophet</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Jeremiah was a boy when King Josiah reigned in Jerusalem. His father was a priest and taught him to pray to God and obey when he was little. At first life was happy for Jeremiah. King Josiah was a good king who wanted to do right and obey God, too. But the people had been turning away from God for a long time, and God was not pleased.</p>

<p>One day the Lord told Jeremiah, &#8220;I have chosen you to be my prophet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jeremiah was surprised and said, &#8220;Lord God, I can&#8217;t speak to people. I&#8217;m just a child.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Lord only said, &#8220;I have words for you to say. Be not afraid of the people, for I will be with you to take care of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>God did have words for Jeremiah to say to the people. &#8220;You have turned away from God and lived very wickedly,&#8221; Jeremiah said. &#8220;The Lord is very displeased and He will send judgment upon you.&#8221; The men were thinking about their money and business. They didn&#8217;t want to listen. The women liked their pearls and beautiful idols, and ignored him. The children laughed and called him silly. They ran off to their selfishness and cheating and lying. Jeremiah was left alone.</p>

<p>Even if the people turned away, God was still there. Again and again He sent messages to the people. Perhaps Jeremiah got tired of seeing their glaring eyes and hearing their mean words. But he obeyed God and kept on doing right. Many times he wept and cried to think how his people were heading for trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only admit your wrongs against God and turn back to Him,&#8221; he pled, over and over. Soon he didn&#8217;t have many friends, but a crowd of enemies.</p>

<p>A new king that didn&#8217;t love God was ruling now. &#8220;The Babylonians are coming and the city will be captured,&#8221; Jeremiah warned. The rulers didn&#8217;t want to hear that. They put Jeremiah in a dark dungeon with black sticky mire. But God took care of him there and sent someone to get him out. And God&#8217;s word was true: the city was surrounded and captured. The men and women were bound as prisoners and the beautiful city was ruined.</p>

<p>It must have broken Jeremiah&#8217;s heart to see the judgment come! But God gave him a promise: &#8220;The day will come when the captivity will return again and I will bring them back. And you shall be my people, and I will be your God.&#8221; Even though he never lived to see that day, Jeremiah trusted and obeyed his God.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a sad story,&#8221; said Alice thoughtfully. &#8220;It must have been hard when no one listened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that is a sad thing,&#8221; agreed Grandpa. &#8220;God loves people, but He never <i>makes</i> them listen and obey. He gives us each a choice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of choice?&#8221; Edward had heard only the end of the story. &#8220;It seemed like God just punished them and let them get captured.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He warned them and pled with them to change for a long time first,&#8221; said Grandpa.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would have listened if God warned me,&#8221; Edward said. &#8220;I would have&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about now?&#8221; interrupted Grandpa with a smile. &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t God still warn us now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess so&#8212;in the Bible,&#8221; Edward said slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And our conscience,&#8221; added Alice. &#8220;Maybe that&#8217;s why Jessica&#8217;s dad doesn&#8217;t let her come. His conscience is probably bothering him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grandpa smiled. &#8220;Remember, we each have choices whether to listen or not. Jeremiah could have quit, too, but he knew it was worth much more to please God than to have others like him.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Something You Can Do</h2>
<p>We all like surprises and making a surprise for someone else is double fun. If you like working in the kitchen, why not make a hidden treasure surprise for dessert? It is especially delicious when Mom has had a long tiring day or everyone has been working hard. Make sure you have the ingredients before you begin.</p>

<h1>Hidden Surprise Dessert</h1>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_18/something_dessert_A.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="66" /></div>
<p>You will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>yellow cake, pound cake, or muffins (leftovers are good)</li>

<li>Instant vanilla pudding (plus milk and eggs to add to it)</li>

<li>Fresh or canned fruits (bananas, berries, peaches, or jam)</li>

</ul>
<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_18/something_dessert_B.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="85" /></div>
<p>Plus:</p>

<ul>
<li>small bowls or dessert dishes</li>

<li>electric blender</li>

<li>mixing bowl</li>

<li>knife and spoon</li>

</ul>
<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_18/something_steps.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="383" /></div>
<ol>
<li>Follow the directions for the instant pudding (one box will make enough for four to six people). Be careful to measure accurately!</li>

<li>Cut up the cake or muffins into bite-size chunks with a knife. Or just break them with your fingers.</li>

<li>Prepare the fruit. Rinse any fresh berries. Cut the larger fruits into small slices.</li>

<li>Now assemble! In each small dish first put a layer of cake pieces. Next spoon on the fruit. Put different kinds into different bowls (this is the surprise part). Last, cover with pudding so that no fruit shows.</li>

<li>Serve on a tray with a big smile. No one will guess what is under the pudding until they take a bite!</li>

<li>Wait! What will make the best surprise? A fancy treat with a big mess in the house won&#8217;t be too special, will it? An extra dose of thoughtfulness will be just the right topping for this hidden treasure!</li>

</ol>

<h1>Respectful Words</h1>

<p>&#8220;Tom!&#8221; Johnny called. &#8220;Tom! Where are you?&#8221; There was no answer and Johnny sat up in bed. &#8220;Mary! MARY!&#8221; Johnny got up and ran down the hall. He stopped. Yes, there in the kitchen was Mary. She seemed very tall, standing at the stove, cooking breakfast. She wore a long dress which almost touched the floor, and her hair was in a big gray bun on her head.</p>

<p>She looked at him and smiled. He liked Mary. Her smile was very kind.</p>

<p>The door opened and Tom came in with an armload of wood. He towered over Mary, and Johnny was a little afraid of him because he was so big. But when he smiled, Johnny felt better, too.</p>

<p>He had been here for two visits now. For two visits to his mother, that is. Tom and Mary had taken him in their car to visit his mother at the prison. Johnny didn&#8217;t like that place. He wished his mother was not in there. She couldn&#8217;t take him home and be his mother.</p>

<p>Before Tom and Mary, there had been Bill and Alice. Then a man and a woman whose names he could not remember. They were mean. Before that were others. Johnny could not even remember much about them.</p>

<p>After breakfast, Tom and Mary would always read the Bible. There was something very special about it. Then they would pray. It was not hard to believe that God listened to their prayers, and that He loved everybody.</p>

<p>This morning, Tom read, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the Lord.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Leviticus+19%3A32" title="Leviticus 19:32"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Leviticus 19:32)</span></a></span> Then he read <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Kings+2%3A23">II&nbsp;Kings 2:23</a> and told the story of the little children who mocked the prophet, Elijah.</p>

<p>&#8220;These children knew they were not being respectful of the prophet,&#8221; Tom said. &#8220;They wanted to make fun of his bald head, and they did not believe that God took care of him.&#8221; He looked at Johnny. &#8220;So, a terrible thing happened to them.&#8221; Then Tom told about the two mama bears that killed them.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we are respectful of those who are older than us,&#8221; said Mary, &#8220;it will show in our words and in how we act. We will want to speak of them with respect. We will not speak to them as we do others our own age.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny thought for a little while. &#8220;You mean I should not call you &#8216;Mary&#8217;?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What do you think you should call us?&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny remembered how he was first told their names. &#8220;Mr. and Mrs. Logan?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Tom Logan nodded. &#8220;Yes, Johnny,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;It would be much more respectful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Johnny,&#8221; Mrs. Mary Logan said, &#8220;you can call us Aunt Mary and Uncle Tom, if you want to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny smiled. &#8220;I love you, Aunt Mary,&#8221; he shyly said. He took Uncle Tom&#8217;s big hand and held it tightly. &#8220;I love you, too, Uncle Tom,&#8221; he whispered.</p>

<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Princess,</p>

<p>There is a very important thing I wish to tell you. It is something the Princess Precious learned the hard way, so perhaps you can pay attention and learn from her mistake.</p>

<p>It was sewing day in the palace school and all the princesses were working on making baby outfits. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to give mine to my new cousin,&#8221; said Precious, stroking the fuzzy soft blue and white fabric. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it going to be cute?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother Matron smiled. &#8220;You are doing a very good job,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If you do as well with the sleeves and hood it will be a lovely present.&#8221; Precious bent to her work with a smile. Of course she would do a good job! She wasn&#8217;t a beginning sewer anymore&#8212;not after sewing a doll blanket all by herself.</p>

<p>Mother Matron was busy with Princess Joy when Precious finished her hemming. &#8220;It will be awhile before she can help me,&#8221; Precious thought. &#8220;I&#8217;ll just work on the next part by myself.&#8221; The pieces of fabric were stacked neatly. Precious took the top piece and looked at it carefully. &#8220;This looks like a sleeve, I&#8217;ll gather the end like I saw Princess Carefulness do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Precious felt very pleased with herself when she had finished the sleeve. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I need Mother Matron&#8217;s help at all,&#8221; she said, and began working on the other sleeve. In and out her needle went through the soft fabric. &#8220;It will be a surprise to show her how much I&#8217;ve done,&#8221; Precious thought as she held up her work. The fabric didn&#8217;t meet at the edge, but a quick scissors snip took care of that.</p>

<p>Class was over and Princess Carefulness stopped by. &#8220;How does it look?&#8221; asked Precious with a smile.</p>

<p>Carefulness looked puzzled. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that sleeve a little different from the other one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it looks quite all right,&#8221; Precious said quickly. Carefulness was probably just jealous of her.</p>

<p>Precious folded the gown and took it up to Mother Matron for inspection. As she saw how far behind the others were, she smiled. But her self-confidence didn&#8217;t last long.</p>

<p>When Precious handed in her work, Mother Matron opened her mouth in surprise. &#8220;Why, dear! How is it that you put the sleeves on without me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t they look nice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m afraid not. You have sewed them up wrong&#8212;and this one is shorter than the other one. What did you do to it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cut the end off to make it straight,&#8221; Precious said in a small voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only thing is to take them off and cut new ones.&#8221; Mother Matron sighed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe we have any blue check left. You&#8217;ll have to use white.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it won&#8217;t look very nice,&#8221; Precious said, blinking back tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but perhaps it will help you learn an important lesson, Precious. When you think you know everything, that is the when you most certainly don&#8217;t.&#8221; So it was that a sorry princess found out that undoing mistakes is much harder than doing it right in the beginning.</p>
