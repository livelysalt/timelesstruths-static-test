<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Princess,</p>

<p>There is a very important thing I wish to tell you. It is something the Princess Precious learned the hard way, so perhaps you can pay attention and learn from her mistake.</p>

<p>It was sewing day in the palace school and all the princesses were working on making baby outfits. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to give mine to my new cousin,&#8221; said Precious, stroking the fuzzy soft blue and white fabric. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it going to be cute?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother Matron smiled. &#8220;You are doing a very good job,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If you do as well with the sleeves and hood it will be a lovely present.&#8221; Precious bent to her work with a smile. Of course she would do a good job! She wasn&#8217;t a beginning sewer anymore&#8212;not after sewing a doll blanket all by herself.</p>

<p>Mother Matron was busy with Princess Joy when Precious finished her hemming. &#8220;It will be awhile before she can help me,&#8221; Precious thought. &#8220;I&#8217;ll just work on the next part by myself.&#8221; The pieces of fabric were stacked neatly. Precious took the top piece and looked at it carefully. &#8220;This looks like a sleeve, I&#8217;ll gather the end like I saw Princess Carefulness do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Precious felt very pleased with herself when she had finished the sleeve. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I need Mother Matron&#8217;s help at all,&#8221; she said, and began working on the other sleeve. In and out her needle went through the soft fabric. &#8220;It will be a surprise to show her how much I&#8217;ve done,&#8221; Precious thought as she held up her work. The fabric didn&#8217;t meet at the edge, but a quick scissors snip took care of that.</p>

<p>Class was over and Princess Carefulness stopped by. &#8220;How does it look?&#8221; asked Precious with a smile.</p>

<p>Carefulness looked puzzled. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that sleeve a little different from the other one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it looks quite all right,&#8221; Precious said quickly. Carefulness was probably just jealous of her.</p>

<p>Precious folded the gown and took it up to Mother Matron for inspection. As she saw how far behind the others were, she smiled. But her self-confidence didn&#8217;t last long.</p>

<p>When Precious handed in her work, Mother Matron opened her mouth in surprise. &#8220;Why, dear! How is it that you put the sleeves on without me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t they look nice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m afraid not. You have sewed them up wrong&#8212;and this one is shorter than the other one. What did you do to it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cut the end off to make it straight,&#8221; Precious said in a small voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only thing is to take them off and cut new ones.&#8221; Mother Matron sighed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe we have any blue check left. You&#8217;ll have to use white.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it won&#8217;t look very nice,&#8221; Precious said, blinking back tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but perhaps it will help you learn an important lesson, Precious. When you think you know everything, that is the when you most certainly don&#8217;t.&#8221; So it was that a sorry princess found out that undoing mistakes is much harder than doing it right in the beginning.</p>

<p class="signature">With love,<br />Aunt Faith</p>
