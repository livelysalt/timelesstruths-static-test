<h1>Great-Aunt Irma&#8217;s Gift</h1>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a package from Great-Aunt Irma,&#8221; Chad said, laying a cardboard box on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s it for?&#8221; asked Rosie, as Mother began cutting the tape.</p>

<p>Daniel peered over her shoulder and read aloud: &#8220;To Danny, Rosie, and Emma Coleman.&#8221; The box contained two books and one little package marked &#8220;for my dear grand-nephew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I guess this must be for you,&#8221; Mother said, handing it to Daniel with a smile. With careful fingers he removed the wrapping and pulled out a silver box with &#8220;Sheaffer Pen&#8221; printed on it. Inside, under a piece of paper, was a silver and green pen with a golden clip. Daniel could only stare at it with shining eyes, but Rosie was impatient.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it out and see how it works. What does the paper say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel took out the paper. One side of it had printing and the words: &#8220;How to fill a Sheaffer Lever-Filler.&#8221; On the other side Great-Aunt Irma had written: &#8220;I found this while cleaning out my desk drawers. It belonged to your great-grandfather and I thought you should have it since you bear his name. Your family is so delightful and well mannered. Do take time to write us sometime. With love, Great-Aunt Irma.&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_18/gift_daniel.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="309" /></div>
<p>Carefully Daniel picked up the pen and looked at it. His own name stared back at him: <i>Daniel Coleman</i>. Under the cap he found that the pen was tipped with a square metal piece. It was shiny gold. &#8220;How does it write?&#8221; he asked in surprise.</p>

<p>Chad looked at the instructions. &#8220;It&#8217;s an old-fashioned fountain pen&#8212;you have to dip it in ink and pull up this lever to fill it. Let&#8217;s try it out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I try it, too?&#8221; Rosie asked, eagerly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll share my book with you. It is all about sea animals.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel didn&#8217;t answer. It was a very special pen and he didn&#8217;t want to share. &#8220;It might get wrecked if everyone tries it,&#8221; he said aloud. &#8220;I&#8217;m just going to use it for special occasions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother came in with a small jar of ink and some paper. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you try it out writing Great-Aunt Irma a thank-you letter,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It was really kind of her.&#8221; She looked straight at Daniel. &#8220;Especially when you didn&#8217;t deserve it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel&#8217;s cheeks grew pink. He remembered how naughty he had been on that visit last summer. Now he could make it right about those gumdrops&#8212;he would write Great Aunt Irma right away.</p>

<p>Rosie watched as Chad helped him fill up the pen. The tip was dipped into the ink and a little lever lifted on the side and sucked it up. At first the pen sputtered and left dark blotches when he wrote. Daniel was persistent, and soon he was making smooth lines easily. He tried not to notice Rosie&#8217;s watchful eyes as he printed:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_18/gift_letter.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="222" /></div>
<p>Daniel paused. How should he tell her about taking the gumdrops? She had thought he was a good little boy who never was bad. It would be easier not to say anything. Besides, she was going to give them the gum drops anyway. But Jesus would want him to tell.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to say now?&#8221; Rosie asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing. I&#8217;m going to finish it later.&#8221; Without looking up Daniel capped the pen and put it back in the little silver box. He gathered everything up and tucked them away in his desk for safekeeping. Maybe he would feel like finishing the letter later.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>That night, while he sat with the family in devotions, Daniel wasn&#8217;t paying much attention. He was thinking of the wonderful pen that had belonged to his great-grandfather. Grandfather had lived in England and had been a secretary in the army during World War I, Daddy had said. Daniel imagined the far places and fierce fights his pen had gone through. It was very valuable&#8212;he would have to take good care of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of treasures do <i>we</i> have?&#8221; Dad&#8217;s question broke into Daniel&#8217;s thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have a nice house, food, and clothes, and furniture,&#8221; suggested Irene.</p>

<p>&#8220;And my dolls and toys,&#8221; little Emma said.</p>

<p>&#8220;My new pen is really special,&#8221; said Daniel, &#8220;&#8217;cause it belonged to great-grandfather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have many treasures,&#8221; Dad agreed, &#8220;but what did Jesus tell us in the verses we read?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to lay up treasures on the earth, where they will get ruined and stolen, but to lay up treasures in heaven,&#8221; said Chad.</p>

<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Lay up&#8217; means to store and keep carefully,&#8221; Dad explained. &#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t we put a lot of importance on our treasures here?&#8221; Everyone was quiet. Daniel was thinking about his pen, his very special, valuable pen. <i>I&#8217;m not going to let it get ruined or stolen,</i> he told himself.</p>

<p>Mom finally spoke up. &#8220;Because Jesus said that <span class="scripture">&#8216;where your treasure is, there will your heart be also,&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+6%3A21%3B+Luke+12%3A34" title="Matthew 6:21; Luke 12:34"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 6:21; Luke 12:34)</span></a></span>&nbsp;&#8221; she said softly. &#8220;If we focus on keeping these things safe, we will lose the eternal treasures.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel didn&#8217;t have much to say at prayer time. <i>What treasures will I lose if I keep my pen safe?</i> he thought. <i>It is mine and no one said I had to share it.</i> &#8220;What about Jesus?&#8221; a voice seemed to whisper. &#8220;He wants you to love others more than yourself. Are you going to obey Him?&#8221; Daniel frowned. <i>I know I should, but I don&#8217;t feel like it. I want that pen to be mine.</i> &#8220;And do you want to be the old, selfish Daniel again?&#8221; the voice asked. <i>No, but&#8230;.</i> With a sigh he pushed the troubled thoughts away and went to bed.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>&#8220;For writing today I want everyone to finish their thank-you letters,&#8221; Mom said the next morning. Daniel slowly pulled out his paper and pen box. The silver and green barrel felt wonderfully smooth in his hand and he was just uncapping it when Rosie came by.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Daniel! Could I please use your pen for the front of my card? I&#8217;ll be very careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m using it right now,&#8221; he said with a scowl. But he stared at the letter a long time before he started to write: &#8220;When I was at your house I took som gum drops. I am sorry becus&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_18/gift_pen.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="146" /></div>
<p>He stopped. <i>How can I say that I&#8217;m sorry and inside be mean and selfish about the pen?</i> Daniel was not one bit happy. The ink had run out and made a dark blot and he suddenly felt like throwing the old pen. <i>It&#8217;s true about the treasure,</i> he thought. <i>Everything is wrong because of this stupid pen.</i> He remembered how happy he had been when Jesus had helped him do the right thing. Daniel knew what he must do. He bowed his head to ask Jesus for help.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rosie?&#8221; He stood by her desk with the silver box. &#8220;You can use my pen if you want,&#8221; Daniel said with determination. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show you how it works.&#8221;</p>
