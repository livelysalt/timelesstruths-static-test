<h1>Dear Reader</h1>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Nehemiah+2%3A17" title="Nehemiah 2:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Nehemiah 2:17)</span></a></span></p>

<p>The Lord wants to build the walls of salvation in our lives to take away the reproach of the marks of sin and ungodly traits in our lives. God has designed a way for us to keep growing more like Him, and keep getting the dross (ungodly things) purged out of our lives.</p>

<p>At my work two opportunities recently came to get some more dross out of my life. First, a little background. For years I was a team leader of a technical team in a government agency, and had a reputation for quality work. I quit that position to work part-time for a while, then quit entirely to attempt to develop a business at home. It did not succeed, but the Lord preserved a part-time place for me back at my old office, now in a humbler role. For a number of reasons (time spent away from that profession, normal mental decline with aging, having to learn the ropes in new areas, etc.), I have made considerably more mistakes than I used to, much to my embarrassment, although they still are happy to have me work there. The first situation I want to mention occurred like this:</p>

<p>Someone was mentioning my name in the context of something that wasn&#8217;t organized very efficiently, and I went to investigate. In a process involving several steps where the work was divided among several people, one person was wondering aloud why the step I worked on didn&#8217;t accomplish more of the process than it did&#8212;she felt the person doing the next step was having to do some of what I should be doing. In my heart I knew reasons to justify myself, but the Lord spoke to my heart to ignore that aspect and just show a willingness to get it &#8220;fixed.&#8221; I did just that, and within an hour or so I had made and tested the necessary changes to everyone&#8217;s satisfaction.</p>

<p>The second situation occurred when my team leader and I met with a customer from another office in the government agency I work in. This customer felt there was a flaw in a process as well as a mistake in its design. I at first defended the notion that there wasn&#8217;t a flaw (in my mind, there seemed good evidence against it), but the Lord began to deal with me about it and I got quiet. We agreed to changes in the design and the customer left. Then my team leader speculated a cause for the flaw the customer thought existed, which I told him I doubted, but would examine it to see. He was right&#8212;I had created that flaw in the process, and I admitted it to him, feeling much humbled in spirit. The Lord showed me I needed to call the customer about it. It was rather difficult and embarrassing for me to make that call, but the Lord helped me&#8212;I thanked the customer for being persistent in insisting that there was a flaw, and that there was one indeed, and that I was fixing it, and I apologized for the error. She responded graciously, and I felt the blessing of the Lord in my heart.</p>

<p>The Lord has been dealing with me in these types of situations about the ungodly sense of ego and superiority that built into my life before I was all His. Doing good- quality work is something to endeavor to do because we love God and it is right, not so we can be proud because people think highly of us. This concern for reputation is a reproach that the Lord is working to get out of my life, and I want it out, too!</p>

<p>My prayer is that this issue will encourage you, together with us, in getting those walls of salvation built stronger and higher!</p>

<h1>God at Work Today</h1>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;O give thanks unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. Let the redeemed of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy; And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+107%3A1-3" title="Psalm 107:1-3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 107:1-3)</span></a></span></p>

<p>The following are some excerpts from recent correspondence. We are limited by space, but wanted to share some testimonies of the Lord working for the encouragement of others of His children.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">God has been teaching us so much. After being involved in Christian schools for some years, God led us to homeschool eleven years ago, at a time when we knew not one other person who was doing it. We were treated very harshly by our church (which ran their own Christian school) for heading in this direction, but God comforted us. It is hard to know what to do sometimes&#8212;we read godly advice which sounds excellent, yet it often conflicts with other excellent godly advice. So we pray. We believe God would have us be a little &#8220;isolated&#8221; for His purposes at this season.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">I&#8217;ve had a number of health problems in the past years. The most difficult to deal with was one where my intestines would tend to twist and fold&#8212;it is extremely painful. We went to a number of doctors, got x-rays, CAT scans, ultrasounds, and a number of other tests. They could tell me what was going on, but not why or how to stop it. The medications that I was given would take the pain down a few notches but the side effects of blurry vision, tiredness, and lack of concentration were not worth it. I decided to try to live with the pain. The past eight years have been the worst&#8212;hard to sit, sleep, stand, ride in a car, almost anything. I was moody and angry with my family and friends. Pain 24/7 takes its toll.</p>

<p>Then, a couple of Wednesdays ago, at Bible study we were discussing angels, healings, and a number of other things. One of the brothers told a story of how his wife was delivered from alcohol addiction&#8212;in an instant. Something in his story struck my heart. At home I thought, &#8220;maybe I should pray for healing.&#8221; But I also felt guilty. God has done so much for us in this short time I felt it almost greedy to ask for anything else. But He says in His word, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Ask, and it shall be given.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+7%3A7" title="Matthew 7:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 7:7)</span></a></span></p>

<p>So, I did. It wasn&#8217;t your conventional prayer, I guess. I stood in the middle of my room with outstretched hands and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m so tired, please take this away from me!&#8221; Then I immediately sat down on my bed and felt something odd and warm on my right side. I touched it&#8212;it was a lump as big as a golf ball. I said out loud, &#8220;Well, this can&#8217;t be good.&#8221; So, I pressed it very lightly and it collapsed&#8212;and all the pain left my body.</p>

<p>I ran out and told my wife. I was bending and twisting back and forth. Nothing&#8212;it was gone. You have no idea how it felt&#8212;pain for so long, then just&#8230;&#8203;gone. In ten days more things have changed than you can imagine. Every time I do something new I wasn&#8217;t able to do before I thank God again. I&#8217;ll never be able to thank Him enough.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">First, allow me to tell you that I am saved and living a holy life the best I know how through the power of the Holy Ghost. I love the Lord and live for Him with all He has given me&#8212;body, soul, and all else. Please, continue to pray for me to live a victorious life all the rest of my life.</p>

<p>God had initially showed me in a vision that He has a clean, pure, and spotless Church, made up of only the pure in heart here on the earth. I did not comprehend the meaning of this wonderful vision then, in October 1977. So I jumped from one group to the other, hoping it was the pure Bride of Christ I had seen in the vision, but only to be frustrated.</p>

<p>Then, around June 2002, God, in His love, care, and grace, sent me another wonderful vision, which I did not comprehend clearly until the beginning of 2003. He showed me that I was faithfully going after Jesus but before I would reach Him, a group would emerge in between with its fogs. I would get enmeshed in this group and get blinded by the fog, but would almost as soon find out that Jesus was not in the group. Then I would get out, see Jesus afar off on the Way ahead and start running after Him again, only to be obstructed by a group again. It was not until I had run clear out of every group division that I caught up with Jesus, who hugged me and kissed me and held me by the hand to lead me on.</p>

<p>As said before, I did not see what the Lord was teaching me in this vision until January 2003. When the full meaning of this vision sunk into my mind, I completely stopped looking for groups, confessed my unfaithfulness to the Lord, and fully consecrated to serve Him and Him only as He showed and led me free from all divisions and their inherent evils. I offered to Him my whole being and asked God to fill me with His Holy Ghost, which I understood as His fully taking His abode in my body (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+14%3A23%2C+1+Corinthians+6%3A19-20">John 14:23, I&nbsp;Corinthians 6:19-20</a>), cleansing me wholly from all carnality and giving me the power to live holy all my life. It was then peace flooded my soul, joy unspeakable became part of my life in all circumstances and love for God and all His creation is now so much my part of life that I would give everything to live this way. I am rejoicing in this glory up to now, for which I truly thank God. I made all effort to do restitution to the best of my ability and I am still willing to do it whenever I become aware of anything of the past not corrected or returned to whoever owed.</p>

<h1>A Bible Definition of Pride</h1>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Oh, to be but emptier, lowlier,
<br />Mean, unnoticed, and unknown,
<br />And to God a vessel holier,
<br />Filled with Christ, and Christ alone!&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/God_in_Heaven_Hath_a_Treasure/index.html" title="God in Heaven Hath a Treasure">*</a></p>

<p>I feel a burden to write about pride, and I want to address the subject in such a way as to be of practical benefit to those who love God and want to walk worthy of the vocation to which they are called (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+4%3A1-2">Ephesians 4:1-2</a>).</p>

<p>The Bible tells us that <span class="scripture">&#8220;the pride of life&#8230;&#8203;is not of the Father, but is of the world.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+2%3A16" title="I&nbsp;John 2:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 2:16)</span></a></span> God has made us capable of achievement, but there is an attitude that arises naturally with achievement that is not of the Father, but of the world. To have victory over pride is to excel and achieve without giving a place to this sinful attitude. In this way, it is similar to being a steward over material increase. <span class="scripture">&#8220;If riches increase, set not your heart upon them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+62%3A10" title="Psalm 62:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 62:10)</span></a></span> You can see at a glance that it is both possible to set your heart upon earthly riches, and it is possible to avoid doing so. The same Father who has made us capable of achievement has also made a way to do exploits and yet possess a lowly mind. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+31%3A20" title="Psalm 31:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 31:20)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Pride, then, is a mental attitude; it is not attainment itself. An individual was once told, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you can keep from being proud because you read so much.&#8221; But it wasn&#8217;t the amount of reading or retention that mattered; it was the attitude of the heart toward the acquisition of knowledge. Jesus was full of goodness and success, but He was able to say, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+11%3A29" title="Matthew 11:29"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 11:29)</span></a></span> We can learn from Him how to be meek and lowly in heart, while conquering and overcoming through the power of God. Jesus was able to reply to the rich, young ruler, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+19%3A17" title="Matthew 19:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 19:17)</span></a></span> Now He was full of goodness, and the servant is as his Master, but the goodness comes from the indwelling God, <i>and the attitude of the heart toward the virtue within is right, i.e., lowly and humble.</i> Jesus was quick to give the credit to God. Although He was God Himself, come down from heaven to offer Himself as an atonement for us, He quickly and reflexively gave the credit for virtue to His heavenly Father. It is this set of heart and mind that avoids the pride of life and lives in humble reliance upon God.</p>

<p>When the man stood in the temple and prayed with himself (not God), it was not that what he had done was wrong, nor was it the fact that he was living more virtuously than other men that condemned him. It was appropriate and right that he was not an extortioner, or unjust, or an adulterer. It would have been wrong, a shame, and a disgrace if he had been guilty of those things. <i>It was the attitude of his heart toward what virtue he had in his life that was dead wrong.</i> He was wrong while he was right, at least in some things. The pride of his heart separated him from God. It kept the door of mercy closed against him. A far more reprehensible man beside him was able to humble himself and attain mercy.</p>

<p>You can readily see that an attitude of deep thankfulness and an attitude of pride are mutually exclusive. There is an independence of God and God&#8217;s bestowals in a proud outlook that renders any attempts at appreciation and gratitude as hollow and insincere. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Daniel+4%3A30" title="Daniel 4:30"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Daniel 4:30)</span></a></span> Notice the independence from God in the declaration of Nebuchadnezzar. There is no acknowledgment whatsoever of how much this king owed his position and worldly success to the God of heaven. The proud Pharisee in the temple <span class="scripture">&#8220;stood and prayed thus <b>with himself</b>.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+18%3A11" title="Luke 18:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 18:11)</span></a></span> He did not pray with God, who resisteth the proud and heareth the humble, but <span class="scripture">&#8220;with himself.&#8221;</span> He went through the motions of giving credit to God, saying, <span class="scripture">&#8220;God, I thank thee,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+18%3A11" title="Luke 18:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 18:11)</span></a></span> but it does not take much insight to see that he was not really leaning on the Lord to live with integrity, nor did he possess the accompanying graces from God that come with receiving His help. For the power and glory that comes from God to make His children overcomers also comes with full provisions for a deep feeling of unworthiness and gratitude.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;I am only an earthen vessel,
<br />The graces within are not mine,
<br />For the love and the power and glory
<br />Belong to the Savior divine.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Only_an_Earthen_Vessel/index.html" title="Only an Earthen Vessel">*</a></p>

<p>Before you can be delivered from pride and be a humble child of God, you must face this inner conviction that you believe that you are superior to others and you must come to an absolute certainty that there is no merit or goodness in you <i>of yourself</i>. Only inasmuch as God is present within you are you good, and then it is not your goodness, but His (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+1%3A17">James 1:17</a>). It cannot be overemphasized how needy we are of God&#8217;s help in this matter of discovering all pride within us. Verily, we cannot do it by ourselves, no matter how rigorously we discipline ourselves. The awful irony is that the very vigor with which we pursue pride in ourselves will induce a hidden pride in that very effort. Proud of our attempts to get rid of pride! Is it possible to escape the pride of life?</p>

<p>Yes, a soul can wait on God with trust in Him (trusting in His provision, <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+11%3A40">Hebrews 11:40</a>) that He will discover everything that needs to be discovered. This waiting is death to the flesh. It is a continuing confession of our need&#8212;very humiliating to our powers of reason, etc. But it is facing reality&#8212;the reality that only God can free us and keep us free of this deadly trait. And, in its essence, humility is simply a coming to terms with this reality: <i>I am weak; I am really weak; really, I <b>am</b> weak; I will always be weak; always, I will be weak; I need God; I will always need God.</i> How utterly, appallingly weak and needy I am! I will never get to a place where I will not be so needy of Him.</p>

<p>There is <i>nothing</i> that I can do to escape my inherent weakness. Even being filled with the power of God does not change the fact that I, myself, continue to be weak. I can be full of might and power by the infusion of His power, but it is always His&#8212;I am still weak in myself.</p>

<p>I repeat, it is not possible to get to this place without the help of the Holy Spirit, who alone knows all and how to bring what He knows to light in just the right way as to be of help. In every way, it is a personal Divine Revelation of the soul&#8217;s need to the mind and will. It is informative to an incredible degree in that wonderful way that God has of saying so much with such little said. He touches the keys to the soul in every case, unlocking and manifesting, revealing and convicting; all with that wonderful tender love and hope that speaks better things than the best of the glory of the natural man. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+39%3A5" title="Psalm 39:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 39:5)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A12-13" title="Hebrews 4:12-13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 4:12-13)</span></a></span> He reveals to us what we need to know to have and retain His approval, and the process is ongoing and precious beyond words. There is such an encouragement in it!</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Hark! I hear Hope sweetly singing
<br />Softly in an undertone,
<br />Singing as if God had taught her,
<br />&#8216;It is better farther on.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/It_Is_Better_Farther_On/index.html" title="It Is Better Farther On">*</a></p>

<p>With all this comes an overwhelming conviction of the rightness of God&#8217;s way&#8212;we plainly see and acknowledge our humble state. Listen to the conviction in these words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Pride must die in you, or nothing of heaven can live in you. Under the banner of this truth, give up yourselves to the meek and humble Spirit of the holy Jesus&#8230;. Humility must sow the seed, or there can be no reaping in heaven. Look not at pride only as an unbecoming temper, nor at humility only as a decent virtue; for the one is death, and the other is life; the one is all hell, and the other is all heaven.</p>

<p>So much as you have of pride, so much you have of the evil one alive in you; so much you have of true humility, so much you have of the Lamb of God within you. Could you see with your eyes what every stirring of pride does to your soul, you would beg of everyone you meet to tear the viper from you, though with the loss of an hand or an eye. Could you see what a sweet, divine, transforming power there is in humility&#8230;&#8203;how it expels the poison&#8230;&#8203;and makes room for the Spirit of God to live in you, you would rather wish to be the footstool of all the world than to want the smallest degree of it.</p>

<p>Only when the soul is fully stirred and aroused to an understanding of its need, only then can you fervently and effectually call on Him who is able to deliver in fervency and faith.</p>

<p>My experience has been that God will break something in you. Something that will help you to keep &#8220;prostrate in the dust&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Oh_This_Blessed_Holy_Rest/index.html" title="Oh, This Blessed Holy Rest">*</a> before Him. It will be as Jacob, who wrestled with an angel all night to get help from God. He would not let go until he was blessed; and finally, <span class="scripture">&#8220;[the angel] touched the hollow of [Jacob&#8217;s] thigh; and the hollow of Jacob&#8217;s thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+32%3A25" title="Genesis 32:25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 32:25)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;And [the angel] said unto [Jacob], What is thy name?

This was what he was&#8212;he had been named accurately. And the angel required him to acknowledge it. After this humbling experience, Jacob never walked as he had before. He limped. His name was changed to Israel, and he was no longer the proud, sly Jacob, but he limped the rest of his life.</p>

<p>And thus it is when God touches us and breaks our self confidence before the awesome truth that <span class="scripture">&#8220;without [Him we] can do nothing,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+15%3A5" title="John 15:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 15:5)</span></a></span> that is, nothing worthwhile.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Only one life, &#8217;twill soon be past;
<br />Only what&#8217;s done for Christ will last.&#8221;</p>

<p>Regarding the natural things of life, we limp. We have come face to face with a great reality, and it takes away our confidence in natural gifts, abilities, talents, energies, etc. With Brother Paul, we can say we have <span class="scripture">&#8220;no confidence in the flesh,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+3%3A3" title="Philippians 3:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 3:3)</span></a></span> and we prove it, too, counting all else but dung that we might win Him and be found in Him; that He might approve of us, use us, and dwell within.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+32%3A10" title="Genesis 32:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 32:10)</span></a></span></p>

<p>When my inner image of myself is adjusted to my needy reality and I have accepted my poverty as a fact of life, then the door is opened for a deep and heart-felt gratitude. How impossible it is to be truly thankful without a humbled heart!</p>

<p>The poet said,</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;None but the holy and innocent sing,
<br />Out of a bosom where pleasures abide.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/The_Happy_People/index.html" title="The Happy People">*</a></p>

<p>This is certainly true, but I would like to put another thought beside it: you can only know real thankfulness as your heart is humbled.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Enshrined within the bosom
<br />Of Father&#8217;s tender love,
<br />We seem in deep mid-ocean

<p>Just as there are certain vantage points of view in observing the landscape, etc., there are places which open to us more perfectly the nature of our relationship with God, with His plan of salvation, and with our small part in the general scheme of things. It is needful to live very lowly to bear the yoke that God has for us with Him. How much damage is done by the pride of men&#8217;s hearts! How necessary it is to be meek and lowly of heart to do the works of God! Jesus commands us, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+11%3A29" title="Matthew 11:29"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 11:29)</span></a></span></p>

<p>In the book <a href="../../../texts/A_True_Story_in_Allegory/index.html" title="A True Story in Allegory">A True Story in Allegory</a>, written by Sister Lottie Jarvis, she writes of &#8220;The Taming School.&#8221; This was and is a way devised by the Apostasy family to control the preaching of the gospel wherever they can. Who were the best candidates for the preachers of apostasy? &#8220;Grade One: This grade will be for those <i>who are a little high-headed, self-sufficient or inclined thereto.</i>&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../texts/A_True_Story_in_Allegory/The_Taming_School/index.html" title="A True Story in Allegory/The Taming School">*</a> Just as it is necessary to be very humble-minded to do the Lord&#8217;s work, it is just as necessary to be at least a little proud to do the devil&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>Some years ago, the author observed a number of precious people who had a great zeal for God, a real missionary burden, and a spirit of sacrifice to pay any price and endure any hardship. They realized that the group of people where they had found the Lord were letting down and compromising truth, and they abhorred that. They withdrew with a lot of blessing, high hopes, and confidence toward the future. I would to God they would have realized all they envisioned.</p>

<p>Years later, I was talking with one who had been part of that. &#8220;I noticed their pride,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I reasoned that they had something to be proud about.&#8221; This brother was young in the Lord and did not realize that all the work of the Holy Spirit in people starts, continues, and ends with lots of humility. In spite of the high profession of these people, the pride was a dead give-away that something was badly amiss. Furthermore, the pride would hinder them from seeing their need.</p>

<p>Thus it has proved out. Soon a hierarchy began to manifest itself among them. One with more experience insisted that he prevail. As did Diotrephes in the Bible, he <span class="scripture">&#8220;love[d] to have the preeminence among them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=3+John+1%3A9" title="III&nbsp;John 1:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (III&nbsp;John 1:9)</span></a></span> The group accepted his dominance. He recognized some as more spiritual than others. In this way, an &#8220;inner circle&#8221; emerged. They lorded it over the others, all in the name of decency and order. The thrust and weight of such scriptures as <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+23%3A8-12">Matthew 23:8-12</a> and <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+5%3A3%2C5-6">I&nbsp;Peter 5:3,5-6</a> were ignored. If you had questioned what was happening, you might be answered by such scriptures as <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+13%3A17">Hebrews 13:17</a>. This is the effect of pride. It exaggerates the direction in which it already has an inner inclination, until lines are crossed and sin is committed. The effect of pride among these dear people was such that the ministry were exalted to the place that should be occupied by the Holy Spirit alone. <i>The entire spirit and nature of the people within the movement changed character as men submitted to men, thinking they were doing God service.</i></p>

<p>But you might say, &#8220;Does not this scripture in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+13%3A17">Hebrews 13:17</a> teach a submission to the ministry?&#8221; Yes, but for it to be properly understood and followed, there must be an humble ministry which will not take advantage of the people whether by accident or design. Such a ministry will stay in the order of God, and that is the kind of ministry that was in the New Testament of which the writer of Hebrews was speaking. It was a ministry in which all children of God&#8212;those anointed to preach the Word and those anointed to hear the Word&#8212;submitted to each other constantly in the Lord. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Yea, <b>all of you be subject one to another</b>, and be clothed with humility.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+5%3A5" title="I&nbsp;Peter 5:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 5:5)</span></a></span> It was not just the hearers submitting to the Lord in the speakers, but the speakers submitting to the Lord in the hearers, also.</p>

<p>Back of all this subject of ministerial authority is the great fundamental difference in the Old Testament and the New. We find it in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+8%3A11">Hebrews 8:11</a>&#8212;<span class="scripture">&#8220;And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.&#8221;</span> God only spoke through some to others in the Old Testament dispensation because no one possessed the law of God written in the mind and heart that is the centerpiece of the New Testament. But in the New Testament, <span class="scripture">&#8220;all shall know me.&#8221;</span> The Lord can and does use any as He sees fit, and others of His children hear His voice and submit. Yea, <span class="scripture">&#8220;a little child shall lead them,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isiah+11%3A6" title="Isiah 11:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isiah 11:6)</span></a></span> as long as that little child is an earthen vessel for the solemn and august voice of God. For His sheep <span class="scripture">&#8220;know his voice. And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+10%3A4-5" title="John 10:4-5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 10:4-5)</span></a></span></p>

<p>But in a given person or group of people, everything depends on their level of humility, which determines how much and how easily they are persuaded by what <span class="scripture">&#8220;seemeth right unto a man.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+14%3A12" title="Proverbs 14:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 14:12)</span></a></span> A great dearth of self-sufficiency in a person will keep you waiting on God, for you will feel your need greatly.</p>

<p>This is what happened to the people mentioned above. Their pride deceived them. They thought they were pretty special. In fact, there was and is definite traits in them of this scripture: <span class="scripture">&#8220;No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Job+12%3A2" title="Job 12:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Job 12:2)</span></a></span> Their human enthusiasm and elation were inspired by their flesh, rather than from heaven, though they knew it not. They were very sincere at first and wanted to do it right, and this seemed right. So they did it. They followed whatever seemed best to their ministry, and their ministry tried to do what seemed best to it, as well.</p>

<p>What followed was classic. Something else was leading, not the Spirit of God. God was faithful to them, but the little checks and warnings were ignored in the general excitement and determination to follow this path. A spirit of emotionalism characterized their meetings. They were full of enthusiasm for display and show, all in the name of demonstrating unity and convincing others of the rightness of &#8220;the way.&#8221; The more they did; the more strenuously they <span class="scripture">&#8220;strain[ed] at a gnat, and swallow[ed] a camel,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+23%3A24" title="Matthew 23:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 23:24)</span></a></span> the more highly they thought of themselves. They could not imagine any reason <i>not</i> to think highly of themselves. They really were superior in life, missionary outlook, and unity to everybody around! They became impatient with humility in others&#8212;especially others coming to them. It became synonymous in their minds with infantile feebleness, and was a thing to be left behind as soon as possible.</p>

<p>In this way, the door was opened to all kinds of errors and oppressions. For, just as humility is the door of entrance into every manifestation of God&#8217;s grace (unmerited favor), pride is the entrance into all manner of evil work. Envy and strife came in like a flood in the absence of humility, and the movement would have fallen apart if the leadership had not clamped down a brutal and oppressive requirement to submit to them in everything. This stopped the tendency toward anarchy, but it did nothing to restrain the growth of pride. For God&#8217;s kingdom works by love for what&#8217;s right and this inner conviction of the soul that one needs and wants whatever God determines is best for oneself. When this love-for-truth through humility is supplanted by desire fueled by pride and ambition, then the humble waiting on God by both ministry and everyone else is gone.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+2%3A3" title="Philippians 2:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 2:3)</span></a></span></p>

<p>I will now quote a little from the writings of Brother Pink:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">When I came in contact with this movement in 1903, I met a people that manifested great love for each other, all spoke the same thing, and at least seemed to see eye to eye. I attended a campmeeting where there were 329 preachers, and there were no lords over God&#8217;s heritage, no Reverend&#8217;s, D.D.&#8217;s, or other lordly titles, only brethren. There were no programs in advance, or committees to guard the pulpit. God was able to bless. There were four sessions every day for ten days, and usually there would be 30 or 35 ministers on or around the platform when time came for services. Usually someone moved out leisurely and delivered the message. I never saw two make a start for the pulpit at the same time. A time or two, they would sing and pray and no one went to the pulpit. They sang and prayed again, but still no one rnoved. Finally someone rose up and said, &#8220;I believe the Lord wants a general testimony service.&#8221; It proved to be a real blessed time in the Lord.</p>

<p>Other times someone would get up right in the rear of the audience and walk leisurely to the pulpit and deliver the message. No one was ever over anxious to get to the pulpit, afraid someone would beat them to it. <i>They knew that no matter who delivered the message, it would be the same truth.</i> Surely the Spirit of God was leading as it should. I have remarked many times that that was the nearest sitting in heavenly places in Christ of any place I have known.</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[<i>Old Paths vs. New Light</i>]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>Meetings such as Brother Pink described I have known in the 1970&#8217;s, although the numbers of people and ministers were much less. And I can testify in the same way as this brother to the blessing that comes from being lowly-minded and letting God have His way. &#8220;They knew that no matter who delivered the message, it would be the same truth.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;I am only an earthen vessel
<br />That Jesus may use as He will,
<br />Whether much I may do in His vineyard,
<br />Or small be the place that I fill.&#8221;</p>

<p>This disposition of lowliness, of focusing on my ungainly characteristics, my need, my poverty, my inadequacies, my general ineffectiveness is just the appropriate and suitable attitude for me to take in the kingdom of heaven. <i>It is an acknowledgment of a solemn reality.</i> &#8220;I am <i>only</i> an earthen vessel.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;I am only an earthen vessel,
<br />But Jesus has pleasure in me;
<br />While I gladly submit to His purpose,
<br />A vessel to honor I&#8217;ll be.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Only_an_Earthen_Vessel/index.html" title="Only an Earthen Vessel">*</a></p>

<p>When the angel appeared to Gideon and hailed him as a mighty man of valor because the Lord was with him, Gideon did not see himself as mighty or valorous. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? Behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father&#8217;s house.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Judges+6%3A15" title="Judges 6:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Judges 6:15)</span></a></span> Although lacking in many ways, he was at least rich in lowliness of mind and heart, which opened the way for God to be with him and use him, and the Lord told him, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Judges+6%3A14" title="Judges 6:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Judges 6:14)</span></a></span> For when we are little in our own eyes, there is no limit to what God can do with us.

Such people will not get in the way; they want God to be glorified.</p>

<p>Note that the might of that hesitant, doubtful man (Gideon) was his humility to God. That humility led to instant obedience, even as the army of Israel was minimized more and more, completely contrary to all human reasoning and common sense. It also led to Divine deliverance with all kinds of implications for good (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Judges+7%3A2">Judges 7:2</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">The writers of the epistles speak of humility in language similar to the language of Jesus. Paul said,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;In honour preferring one another.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+12%3A10" title="Romans 12:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 12:10)</span></a></span> Do not seek to be the greatest; do not seek for highest honors; but seek the lowest place and prefer that your brother have the honor. This text Conybeare and Howson render thus: &#8220;In honor let each set his neighbor above himself.&#8221; It reads as follows in Rotherham&#8217;s translation: &#8220;In honor outdoing one another.&#8221; The word rendered <i>prefer</i> means &#8220;to take the lead&#8221; in being nothing. &#8220;Be ambitious to be unambitious.&#8221; Outdo each other in being humble and show this by preferring that others have all the honor. Some have grace enough to be willing that honors be given to another if they themselves can have equal honors; but to the truly humble such grace is given as enables them to secretly desire all honor to be given to others. Is this your experience?</p>

<p>Suppose that in company with three other brethren you went to pray for a man dying of consumption. The man was healed instantly and in a few days was a well and strong man. Someone, in telling of this wonderful healing, told who the other brethren were that prayed for the dying man, but failed to mention you. An account of the healing appeared in the paper, giving the names of the other brethren that were present and prayed, but omitting your name. Would you secretly rejoice? Would you be really and truly glad if it should never come to the ears or minds of anyone that you, too, were present and prayed for the man? O my brother, if you are humble, you will rejoice to be unknown and unnoticed.</p>

<p>At one time two brethren made a visit to some sisters. Several beautiful songs were sung by the sisters. Finally one of the brethren sang a very inspiring hymn. There was, however, but little comment upon the hymn. After the lapse of a few moments the brother asked whether any of the company had ever heard that hymn before. The reply was that they had not. He then told them that the Lord had given him that song down in the rural districts of one of the southern states. The point for the brother to examine closely is, Did he desire to magnify the Lord, and the Lord alone? Or, did he have a secret desire to let the company know that he was the composer? Self has a desire to be set forward, an itching to be noticed. The Apostle John would have said, &#8220;The Lord gave a disciple that song to His own glory.&#8221; How beautiful a grace is humility! Self sometimes gets so cunning as to seek applause by seeming to shun it.</p>

<p>Now the same God that humbled Nebuchanezzar is able to humble you. He wants your consent, however. He is able to humble you without your consent and do good thereby, but for you to really get the blessing out of it that He wants to give you, you must <span class="scripture">&#8220;humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+5%3A6" title="I&nbsp;Peter 5:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 5:6)</span></a></span> God will do His part, but you must humble yourself. That is your part. You must pass condemnation upon whatever the Spirit of God reveals as pride in your life. God provides humbling circumstances and situations to everyone on earth, but only a few are getting out of this all that they should. If you want to be one of those who receives all the benefit of God&#8217;s dealings with you, you must humble yourself. This means more than just deciding to be humble. You must embrace the reality and let the conviction of your great need and dependence settle deep in your heart. You must cry for assistance to do this, for we are so needy, that we cannot even humble ourselves appropriately without Divine assistance. How little we are; how insignificant in ourselves! How little we matter as human beings; how little we count in the great scheme of things! And, as individuals, how small and cramped are our gifts! There are many who can do so many more things better than we can. And God can bless anyone at any time to surpass our feeble efforts greatly!</p>

<p>How unreasonable it is to be proud! How foolish to exalt ourselves! How ungainly and awkward an earthen vessel! How unlearned; how lacking in eloquence! How easily brought to confusion; how easily baffled and perplexed! And together we are just as needy as individually! We have been created to need God, and, oh, do we ever need Him!</p>

<h1>Kidnap Attempt!</h1>

<p>About eight-thirty in the morning, my older daughter heard the sound of a car idling on the road. She had stayed the night with her sister and her four-month-old baby. C&#8212;&#8212; was scared. Her sister had been followed several times recently, and she had heard that relatives of the baby were looking for the baby to take it.</p>

<p>The car sounded as if it had stopped on the road, and the engine continued to run. C&#8212;&#8212; could not see very well, so she quickly went and told A&#8212;&#8212; about the matter, whereupon my younger daughter quickly went to the window and saw a sight that chilled her through and through. A young Hispanic man was running down the driveway to the back of the house. His face was contorted into a grin of fiendish glee, and he carried two great green things, apparently of glass, in each hand as he ran. They seemed to be wine bottles. (We surmised that he might have intended to break them to use as weapons.)</p>

<p>A&#8212;&#8212; immediately called the police. We speculate that the young man heard them talking to the police on the phone, and he went back to the car and left. After talking to the police, A&#8212;&#8212; called her mother and me, and I advised her to leave the house immediately. They did. The sheriff&#8217;s deputy found no trace of the young man or his car. When we came back to my daughter&#8217;s house later, however, the back door had been forced open; the inner door within had been broken, as well. Nothing was missing from the house. The young man was not a burglar; he had come to kidnap the child.</p>

<p>We learned later that the mother of the baby&#8217;s biological father wanted the child. The father was in jail on the day of the kidnap attempt. But we were told that he had taken a son of his when he was a child and held him five years before the authorities recovered him.</p>

<p>This incident brought a level of stress and fear to our family which was unprecedented. Every white vehicle and every Hispanic male driver was scrutinized as we drove or as we watched who came down the street. My daughter was afraid to go back to her home, and she and her baby became guests in her parents&#8217; home. We were nervous and jumpy to an incredible degree, insomuch that the baby cried and cried. She could sense that something was wrong.</p>

<p>My daughter had been advised against taking this baby because she was unmarried and only nineteen years old at the time. She had been taking foster care classes to assume responsibility for a school-age child. A mother of one of A&#8212;&#8212;&#8217;s school students told her that her niece was to lose her baby to the state when it was born, as the mother was an unfit mother and the boyfriend (father) was abusive and violent. This was sad and undesirable, but an equally unattractive case could be made for a single parent family, with all that would hold for the future. The child would be raised without a father.</p>

<p>The mother of the child and my daughter had played together as children, and she decided that she wanted A&#8212;&#8212; to have her baby, since she would not be allowed to keep it. The mother of another family wanted to adopt the baby, and A&#8212;&#8212; talked the birth mother into giving her baby to this family, but then the father of that family could not feel clear to take on that responsibility, and so my daughter ended up with the child. My wife and I had prayed that the Lord would block the matter. But, to our amazement and consternation, our prayers were overruled; and the baby was given by the judge to our daughter. She was awarded permanent custody and guardianship.</p>

<p>At that point, we recognized that God had permitted this trial, that He had allowed A&#8212;&#8212; to have this awesome responsibility, and that He would give us grace to bear what would need to be borne.</p>

<p>All of this had seemed hard enough. After about a month after the birth of the baby, the birth mother wanted the baby back&#8212;even though she would never be permitted by the state to keep the baby. And now, an attempted kidnapping?</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Beloved, <b>think it not strange</b> concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+4%3A12" title="I&nbsp;Peter 4:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 4:12)</span></a></span> These words stood out to me as I grappled with the effect of this crime on my family.</p>

<p>I found myself assaulted with powerful feelings of revenge. It was suggested over and over to me to bring this to an end by whatever means were necessary. Scenarios of violence and ambush were vividly painted in my imagination, all of them concluding with a promise of satisfaction and closure. Against all this temptation, I began to lay hold again on the promises of God to get the good out of the trial. <i>To work the trial, rather than allow the trial to work me.</i></p>

<p>I recognized first that God had allowed and measured out this trial, working as usual through others. He had foreseen the exact consequences on all of us, and He had exactly the amount of grace and help that were necessary to go through the trial with victory. Furthermore, the Lord helped me to realize that we <i>needed</i> this trial. I needed more love for the young man who was terrorizing my family. I began to see the matter from his standpoint&#8212;as God had seen it all along. This child (my guardian grandchild) was actually bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. The child really belonged to his family. His family had failed miserably to take care of the child, so much so that the child was taken from them, but the child was really theirs. This was humbling to acknowledge, but it was and is the truth. A great deal of grace was released to my heart with this realization and confession. I was able to love the kidnapper from my heart. Praise the Lord! Furthermore, I felt sorry for him. He was deprived of his family&#8217;s child. She was being raised in the home of a different race. It was plain that he needed grace from God to acknowledge the painful fact that his people had failed the child to the extent that the state had intervened and taken the child from them. I began to get a burden to earnestly pray for him (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+5%3A44">Matthew 5:44</a>). I began to pray that he and his kindred would abandon the quest to retrieve their baby <i>for the very highest and finest of motives</i>. The painful temptations to resist began to melt before these blessings. Praise God! <span class="scripture">&#8220;He is able to succour them that are tempted.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+2%3A18" title="Hebrews 2:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 2:18)</span></a></span> (See also <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+5%3A39+and+James+5%3A6">Matthew 5:39 and James 5:6</a>.)</p>

<p>A week later, on a Sunday night, my wife awoke me. &#8220;Honey,&#8221; she said, &#8220;there is a white truck in the driveway, and a Hispanic man has come to the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>My daughter fled to the bathroom in the back of the house with the baby. As I went to the door, the thought kept occurring of the shotgun I keep to shoot skunks and possums that raid the chicken yard, but (praise God!) it was not hard to push away. At the door, before opening it, I called, &#8220;Who is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>A man&#8217;s voice answered, &#8220;Bob Davis!&#8221; It seemed that this was someone for whom my wife had baked a pie, so I opened the door. A Hispanic-appearing man stood there. I knew the police had been called, and could be arriving any moment, so I said, &#8220;The police have been called.&#8221; I did not want him to be alarmed if they did arrive while he was there. And sure enough, he was there for the pie.</p>

<p>The next day, around noon, my older daughter came to me and said, &#8220;Daddy, there is a white car on the street, going very slowly!&#8221; I looked out at the street, but the car was not there. It was in our driveway! A man was getting out. He was not Hispanic, but he carried a box. What was in the box? He certainly had our attention. To our relief we realized he was the piano tuner. It was the first time he had been to our house.</p>

<p>A trial of God&#8217;s appointing goes everywhere, purging, refining. It is all-pervasive; it accomplishes that whereunto it is sent. We are crowded. The nerves and strength of my wife and myself are not what they have been in the past, during our child-bearing and child-raising years. God has measured out a trial that has brought it all back in focus. &#8220;Beloved, <b>think it not strange</b>.&#8221; He loves us. He wants us to make it to heaven.</p>

<p>God is quite capable of dealing with us. He knows how to bring us an agony that will present us the truth in inescapable terms. It is His mercy that does so. He could even allow this child to be taken from us to effectively work His will on us. He can strip us of health, of money, of family members and friends through even death, to help us be willing to come to an end of ourselves and voluntarily surrender to and embrace the truth. He will put a longsuffering in your heart, a joy in sorrow, and a profound thankfulness. Yea, <span class="scripture">&#8220;The L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, endureth for ever.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+138%3A8" title="Psalm 138:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 138:8)</span></a></span></p>

<h2>Hudson Taylor&#8217;s Spiritual Secret</h2>
<p>by Dr. and Mrs. Howard Taylor, edited and revised by Gregg Lewis</p>

<p>Find the riches of a life abandoned to God! Hudson Taylor is stirred to read China&#8217;s millions with the gospel, and learns to lean entirely on God through life&#8217;s trials and suffering. From one who became characterized by his perfect peace:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">&#8220;But how inconsistent unbelief always is! I had no doubt but if I prayed for fellow-workers, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, they would be given.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8203;But I had not then learned to trust God for keeping power and grace for myself, so no wonder I could not trust Him to keep others who might be prepared to go with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8212;early 1865</p>

</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p class="first">&#8220;I strove for faith, but it would not come; I tried to exercise it, but in vain. Seeing more and more the wondrous supply of grace laid up in Jesus&#8230;&#8203;the fullness of our precious Savior, my guilt and helplessness seemed to increase&#8230;. What was I to do?</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8203;the Spirit of God revealed to me the truth of our oneness with Jesus as I had never known it before. &#8216;Ah, there is rest!&#8217; I thought. &#8216;I have striven in vain to rest in Him. I&#8217;ll strive no more. For has not He promised to abide with me&#8212;never to leave me, never to fail me?&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8212;letter to his sister in 1866</p>

</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p class="first">&#8220;My need now is great and urgent, but God is greater and more near. And because He is what He is, all must be, as is, all will be well. Oh, my dear brother, the joy of knowing the living God, of seeing the living God, of resting on the living God in our very special and peculiar circumstances!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8212;letter to a close friend in 1872</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Originally shared by his son and daughter-in-law, the edited and revised version weaves the narrative and personal letters into a compelling story. We value this book because its focus is on what God can do through a life fully submitted to Him, rather than the man himself. It is a spiritual inspiration to the last page.</p>

<h1>&#8220;I Write unto You, Young Men&#8221;</h1>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first"><span class="scripture">&#8220;I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+2%3A14" title="I&nbsp;John 2:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 2:14)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+5%3A22-23" title="Galatians 5:22-23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 5:22-23)</span></a></span></p>

<p>I am thinking, young men, of temperance. <i>Self-control</i>, <i>moderation</i>, and <i>restraint</i> are other words that help convey the meaning of this fruit of the Spirit. Peter speaks of temperance as something to be diligent to add to other qualities, and of its value in keeping us fruitful (2 Pet. 1:5-8). Brother Paul speaks of it as a quality that aged men should have, and a requirement for elders (Tit. 2:2; 1:5-9). I find myself in need of more temperance, the longer I live for the Lord. I want to examine some scriptures on this subject, with the help of the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+25%3A16" title="Proverbs 25:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 25:16)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Our outward man is prone to excess. If we like something, or find it satisfies something in us, we tend to indulge in it until it has obvious negative effects. Each of us is different, and either are naturally moderate or learn to be moderate in various areas, but each of us has our &#8220;honey.&#8221; Let me tell on myself as an example. When I was eight, our family went to an &#8220;all you can eat&#8221; buffet restaurant. I was an intemperate eater, and ate so much that I felt sick and actually did go vomit (in the seclusion of the restaurant&#8217;s bathroom). Such was my gluttony, that after being so relieved, I went back and ate some more. I never went to that extreme again, but I remember through my childhood and young adulthood that at special meals (particularly Thanksgiving and various special occasions) that I almost invariably felt very uncomfortable after I finished eating. This is an area of my life that the Holy Spirit has been working on me, and although I&#8217;m gaining ground, I have a great deal more ground to gain, and I&#8217;m more subject to difficulty in this area than any of my children. Now you may find it a fairly simple matter to <span class="scripture">&#8220;eat so much as if sufficient,&#8221;</span> but perhaps you have some other area. Maybe you read to the exclusion of other responsibilities, or play some game immoderately, or indulge in humor until you are hysterical or fatigued, or are undisciplined in your sleeping habits. The concept of sufficiency is something that we all naturally tend to define for ourselves, but real sufficiency is defined by God, and exemplified in Jesus. He could feast or fast, labor or rest, speak or be silent in accordance with Father&#8217;s direction, by keeping in touch with Him in prayer.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+6%3A12" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 6:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 6:12)</span></a></span></p>

<p>To be <i>expedient</i> in this use means to be helpful or profitable. A supermarket sells many different items, and is constantly trying new ones and phasing out old ones by this test, whether the item is profitable. The test of profitably isn&#8217;t as simple as it might first look, either. If I&#8217;m the storeowner and I find that a certain bagel yields me a higher profit per unit than, say, a doughnut, I could try completely phasing out doughnuts and replacing that whole section with those bagels, but what if the demand for those bagels isn&#8217;t that high? Or even if it is, what if a number of customers like doughnuts enough that they stop shopping at my store and find another one that carries doughnuts, and I lose more in overall sales than I gained by selling more bagels?</p>

<p>Even so in our lives, if we consider soberly, we find that we are not really as good at determining profitability for our souls as we think. I may do something that I know is not inherently wrong, but it may use my time and energies in ways that are to my disadvantage, spiritually. Maybe a certain interest, if indulged, dominates my thinking and hinders my appetite for spiritual things. Maybe another interest or appetite, when not restrained, begins to &#8220;suck me in,&#8221; so to speak. The &#8220;glorious liberty of the children of God&#8221; is a liberty that can only be maintained by close attention to our Guide, and a ruthlessness to keep our spirit on top of our body.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+21%3A34-36" title="Luke 21:34-36"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 21:34-36)</span></a></span></p>

<p>The word <i>surfeiting</i> refers to the giddiness and headache caused by drinking wine to excess. I hope none of you readers are those who run into this problem, but there are other things we can do to excess, such that we become giddy or have aches of either temporal or spiritual nature. In addition, our normal responsibilities in life can become cares that dominate our hearts and minds so as to leave us spiritual weak or lean. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Take ye heed, watch and pray,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+13%3A33" title="Mark 13:33"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 13:33)</span></a></span> our Lord exhorts us. Do you want to be able to <span class="scripture">&#8220;stand before the Son of man&#8221;</span>? When the day of judgment comes, will that &#8220;harmless indulgence&#8221; the Lord showed you that you needed to give up, or that enjoyment that you had to be so restrained in, be of any significance to you at all compared to being able to <span class="scripture">&#8220;stand before the Son of man&#8221;</span>?</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+13%3A13-14" title="Romans 13:13-14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 13:13-14)</span></a></span>
</p>
<p>The word <i>wantonness</i> is defined as &#8220;unbridled lusts.&#8221; Some of you may have or be familiar with well-trained horses or beasts of burden that take guidance well without bridles, but what has really happened is that they are operating with a &#8220;hidden&#8221; bridle, whether that be attributed to training, affection for the master, or some other cause. Look at the various activities we are warned against above, and consider whether the idea &#8220;unbridled&#8221; is not a common theme. What is our bridle? <span class="scripture">&#8220;But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221;</span> The more we make provision for Jesus, the less we make provision for the flesh. The more we move at Jesus&#8217; touch, the less the lusts of the flesh draw us.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+9%3A24-27" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 9:24-27"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 9:24-27)</span></a></span></p>

<p>When I was in the fifth grade, I learned to play the trombone, and was part of a band composed of elementary students from all over the school district. There were seven trombone players, and each week the band director would devote part of our session to &#8220;challenges.&#8221; A person could challenge the player one seat &#8220;above&#8221; themselves, and if the challenge was successful, they would trade places with that person. As the new student, I was &#8220;seventh trombone.&#8221; I began to practice somewhat regularly, and soon found that by challenging, I rose several positions in a few weeks. The competition grew more intense as I rose in the ranks, until I became second trombone. I found the will to spend from 45 to 90 minutes every day in practice, and challenged the first trombone player the next week. I won! I spent the following week enjoying the feeling of being first trombone, and then found myself challenged and sent back to second! I stirred myself, and soon I was first again. I think you can guess how the rest of the year went. I alternated between first and second trombone for the remainder of the year, as first one of us, then the other, would put the extra effort in to improve our skills past the other. There were times, of course, when one or the other of us had other priorities, and several weeks might go by without a challenge, but generally, we two stood apart from the rest of the trombone players because we were running to obtain, and made sacrifices in our lives to do so.</p>

<p>In the spiritual race for heaven, we are not trying to beat other people, and there isn&#8217;t only one or a small, fixed number of positions to compete for. There are, however, many spiritual opponents and obstacles, and &#8220;obtaining&#8221; requires surmounting every single obstacle that confronts you as you go along. We must be temperate in order to obtain heaven. We must run with purpose, keeping our bodies mastered by our spirits (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A13">Romans 8:13</a>), rather than the reverse, lest we fail to win the prize!</p>

<p>I see a young man starting out, overcoming every obstacle. The race grows long, and now the obstacles seem great indeed. He wonders if it is really worth it, after all, and his weariness magnifies the cost and minimizes the prize in his mind. There is one thing that stands in his way, and it really seems too much to be asked to climb this obstacle. &#8220;Why not go around just this once?&#8221; a voice whispers in his mind. Oh, young man, call on God! Remember the great prize that awaits. Your weariness will be as nothing on That Day!</p>

<p>God has promised strength to those who call for it. What? Are your senses dulled by some <span class="scripture">&#8220;honey&#8221;</span> that you have been eating beyond what is sufficient? Does something of this temporal life have power over you? Oh, young man, pray, <i>pray!</i> Cast aside whatever you must until you can pray effectually, until you again clearly see the prize, and the One who called you to run for heaven.</p>

<p>Thank God, I see the young man praying, now he climbs again, the obstacle is overcome! I have hopes of meeting him on That Day&#8212;pray for me, I want to obtain the prize, and not be a castaway.</p>

<h1>King David&#8217;s Sons</h1>

<p>David was taken from the sheepcote, where he had learned to trust God to fight the battles of life by contending with lions and bears. He was taken to a king&#8217;s court, where he discovered that there were much more deadly foes than these animals. He found himself on a sea of adversity, and every victory God gave him simply made his situation more precarious. He became a fugitive for years, an outlaw with a price on his head; and undertook the thankless job of riding herd on relatives, the distressed, debtors, and the discontented. In all of this, God had mercy on him and helped him.</p>

<p>After all these experiences, <span class="scripture">&#8220;unto David were sons born in Hebron.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Samuel+3%3A2" title="II&nbsp;Samuel 3:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Samuel 3:2)</span></a></span> Imagine the feelings in David&#8217;s heart as he gazed in turn on Amnon, Chileab, Absalom, Adonijah, Shephatiah, and Ithream. It is impossible to believe that this sensitive man, this poet, would not have played with his children, rejoicing in their little lives with each little advantage gained. It is true that each of these children had a different mother, and this was not according to the divine pattern of marriage from the beginning, but in the Old Testament dispensation, God suffered men to do many things because of the delay in providing something better for them through the blood of Jesus.</p>

<p><i>Sons</i> were born unto David. <span class="scripture">&#8220;A man child is born unto thee; making him very glad.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+20%3A15" title="Jeremiah 20:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jeremiah 20:15)</span></a></span> Surely he felt toward each of these infant boys as Jacob felt toward Rachel&#8217;s youngest, <span class="scripture">&#8220;his father called him Benjamin,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+35%3A18" title="Genesis 35:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 35:18)</span></a></span> which means, &#8220;son of my joy.&#8221; Perhaps he brought each of them presents: a miniature sword, spear, or bow; or perhaps a scroll or hammer, just as fathers imagine future capabilities and needs in their offspring today. How he must have doted on them!</p>

<p>Our children are washed and shining markerboards before us, and it seems so plausible and possible to write boldly upon them: &#8220;Thou shalt be a warrior.&#8221; &#8220;Thou shalt be a priest.&#8221; &#8220;Thou shalt be noble and do exploits.&#8221; And with this comes an uprising of consecration. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be there for you. I&#8217;ll tell you all I have discovered and know. I&#8217;ll share in your triumphs and commiserate with you in your setbacks.&#8221; At this stage of things, it seems so likely, so appropriate, that this bone of your bone and blood of your blood will become an extension of your experience, your understanding, your very life.</p>

<p>Reality intrudes. There are many other influences in the child&#8217;s life besides those of his parents. And, in addition to the influences of the spouse and the spouse&#8217;s family, what of sin and inherited depravity? The entire human race has been under the curse of Adam since the fall, and we were all born <span class="scripture">&#8220;the children of wrath.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+2%3A3" title="Ephesians 2:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 2:3)</span></a></span></p>

<p>God designed the human experience to be perpetuated through mothers, fathers, and their offspring growing up in the family. (Consider: should we not be thankful that we are not designed for continuation in the manner of turtles?) There is a wonderful divine wisdom in the process. Few things have the capacity to humble us and get a hold of our hearts as the care and nurture of our children. We catch a hint of this in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+2%3A15">I&nbsp;Timothy 2:15</a>. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Saved in childbearing&#8221;</span>! Many a young father and mother has been sobered and settled by the awesome responsibility of launching a new life. The great Creator has positioned a profound experience in the earthly existence of men which operates wonderfully on the soul.</p>

<p>As with most things that have great capacity for joy and glorious fulfillment, parenting also has an equally great capacity for the greatest desolation and searing horror. Here again, our great continual need for divine assistance is underlined and underlined again and again.</p>

<p>We get an insight into the values of King David&#8217;s parenting in the <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Samuel+13">thirteenth chapter of II&nbsp;Samuel</a> where Ammon, David&#8217;s son, and his friend, Jonadab, plan to outwit the protections designed and engineered for the safety of the members of the family. It was necessary to get the king&#8217;s (father&#8217;s) permission to execute their evil design. The family of David had built-in protections in the way access was allowed to each other; they were surrounded by walls, so to speak, and these walls must need be breached for the disastrous horror conceived by Ammon and Jonadab to succeed.</p>

<p>We also perceive that it is not enough to wisely govern or to apply solid values of virtue and honor to the family circle <span class="scripture">&#8220;Except the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> build the house, <b>they labour in vain that build it</b>: except the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+127%3A1" title="Psalm 127:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 127:1)</span></a></span> This scripture was inspired to the understanding of one of David&#8217;s sons. If the Spirit of God had given discernment to David as he visited Ammon in his faked illness and listened to his request, then Tamar would have been spared tragedy and Absalom would not have taken up his blood grudge for his sister&#8217;s sake which opened the way to his ambition to usurp the throne and murder his father.</p>

<p>All of David&#8217;s hopes that his children would grow up to be fine, noble young men and women were dependent on God&#8217;s helping him at every critical moment. He was doing his best, but <i>his best was not good enough.</i> He needed more than his best; David needed God in this. The reader can see at a glance that both things are critical for success in this most solemn of ventures: an applied understanding of heavenly wisdom in the raising, training, and governing of the young, and direct intervention and inspiration from God.</p>

<p>A mother was washing dishes one night. The voice of her Lord spoke to her. &#8220;Go outside,&#8221; He said. She lived in a farmhouse deep in the country, and there were no curtains on the windows. In obedience to the voice, she went outside. She could see inside the bedroom of her youngest daughter. This daughter was standing in front of the mirror, scissors in hand, preparing to carefully and unobtrusively cut her hair (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+11%3A15">I&nbsp;Corinthians 11:15</a>). &#8220;Delores!&#8221; the mother called out of the dark, &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Had God not alerted the mother&#8217;s heart, it is unlikely that the actions of the daughter would have been noticed. The worldliness of the daughter&#8217;s heart was rebuked, and it was rebuked in such a way that the Spirit of God used the incident to deal with her heart. She got saved, eventually married a saved young man, and is living for God today. It could have been different, but God helped the mother.</p>

<p>At the critical moment, in King David&#8217;s family, <i>God did not help David.</i> He just left him to do the best that he could. This was not arbitrary, and it certainly was not because God did not care. God did care, but David had stepped over a certain line wherein the justice of God proscribed a certain judgment. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Thus saith the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Samuel+12%3A11" title="II&nbsp;Samuel 12:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Samuel 12:11)</span></a></span> To fulfill this judgment, God did not have to do anything but withdraw. It is a sober thought indeed to consider that all God has to do is withdraw from us just a little, and then we and ours will most certainly come to grievous harm.</p>

<p>Just a little independence of God, a little stubbornness, a little wilfulness. Just a little pride in my family background, my achievements, my grasp of the whole subject of child raising. What damage it can do if God just leaves me alone or if I resist the gentle prompting of His Spirit! So much is at stake!</p>

<p>God has seen fit to allow the great majority of mankind to undergo the experience of governing other human beings. It is a solemn and weighty responsibility with lifelong consequences. Once you are a parent, you are never a non-parent again. Even if your children die and you are left, you are still a parent. If you neglect and shirk your responsibilities, you are still a parent&#8212;a neglectful and negligent parent. All Bible counsel and mandate that applies to government at other levels finds some application in this most common and serious responsibility.</p>

<p>God, in mercy, has left us an all-encompassing example of parenting. The great Father-In-Heaven tells us, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A1" title="Ephesians 5:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 5:1)</span></a></span> Another translation reads, &#8220;Be ye imitators of God.&#8221; The Bible speaks of God&#8217;s management of us in these terms, <span class="scripture">&#8220;My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A5-7" title="Hebrews 12:5-7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 12:5-7)</span></a></span> Here is a whole school in the necessity and secrets of chastisement. It is perfectly done by God the Father. Again we read, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+1%3A8" title="Ephesians 1:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 1:8)</span></a></span></p>

<p>In this sinful world, many live their lives at great disadvantage; for the iniquity of the parents is afflicted on the offspring, even to the third and fourth generation. Many parents do not know how to parent; many are clueless as to even know where to begin. Others are horribly scarred and disfigured by abuses and excesses. Some have been raised by incompetent parents; others have not been raised at all, they just grew up without any oversight. Still others have been twisted by deceptions and philosophies. Shattered homes are everywhere.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this wreckage and desolation, God the Father continues to manifest a beautiful and perfect example of comprehensive parenting. He perfectly deals with the normal and the abnormal challenges of mankind. Truly, <i>He doeth all things well.</i></p>

<p>You may say, &#8220;Well, He is God. How can I be like Him?&#8221; I will answer, &#8220;He wants you to be godly. He wants you to be a partaker of His nature and of His wisdom.&#8221; You will, of course, never even come close to His capability and capacity, nor were you intended to do so. That is not the point. It is simply that He has what you need and is able and willing to impart it to you. He is a perfect example. He is able to sustain and support you. He is able to fill in the gaps and compensate for the shortcomings in your understanding and ability. God is able to teach you how to parent even if your parents failed you.</p>

<p>We read of a mother who experienced a strange and bewildering conflict between two brothers before they born. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? <b>And she went to inquire of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>.</b> And the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+25%3A22-23" title="Genesis 25:22-23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 25:22-23)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Now God is the alpha and omega of all our needs, and this includes our children as well. He was there when the soul of the child was <i>given</i>, and He is there when the soul of the child <i>returns</i> to Him who gave it (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ecclesiastes+12%3A7">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>). He knows everything there is to know about each of us, including a perfect comprehension of those for whom we are responsible, and He imparts His wisdom to us without upbraiding (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+1%3A5">James 1:5</a>). It is our privilege to inquire of the Lord and get the answers we need to fulfill our sacred charge.</p>

<p>One of the more humbling aspects of governing other human beings is the incredible diversity of human nature and mentality. Many a mother or father has thought on one or more of their children with baffled incomprehension. &#8220;This child is not like me. He (or she) is not like my spouse. He&#8217;s just different!&#8221; As an old sister said to my wife and I after our first was born, &#8220;Each one comes with its own recipe!&#8221; This is very true, although it is frequently denied by those who insist on forcing square pegs into round holes, etc. (&#8220;Come on! You&#8217;re really round! Go on in!&#8221; <i>Wham! Wham! Wham!</i>) Because people are so different, a simplistic approach is inadequate. Many a couple has been given a submissive, easy-to-manage child as their first-born, and they have had a relatively easy time of it, as a result. This lulled them into thinking they were mastering this parenting business. Then God would given them a bigger challenge in the second, third, or fourth; and it would seem as if hardly any of the lessons grasped in the first continued to apply. The latter-born would be so different as to make the parents have to learn all over again how to do their job. Then again, at times it goes the other way; and the first-born is a real handful.</p>

<p>A parent was asked by one of her grown children if she disciplined all of them the same. The question was framed by a discussion about treating our children fairly and evenly. &#8220;No,&#8221; she replied. The listener was surprised. &#8220;Some of you needed more spankings,&#8221; the mother said. It can be unfair to treat all the children equally.</p>

<p>If we are guided by a reasoning that seeks to amplify the uniqueness of each child, we will give them a false impression of what our existence is all about. Each of us <i>is</i> a unique treasure, but each of us must deal with our Creator, with moral law, with the common boundaries that God has imposed on all mankind. If we ignore the specialness of each human being, we err. It must be considered, but <i>all</i> are subject to the Word of God. The little boy said, &#8220;I know I must be special, cause God don&#8217;t create no junk!&#8221; Yet, He is no respecter of persons.</p>

<p>Absalom thought he was mighty special. And he was. He had movie-star good looks. The Bible even informs us about how unique his hair was (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Samuel+14%3A25-26">II&nbsp;Samuel 14:25-26</a>). His daughter, Tamar (named after her aunt), was beautiful, also. These people needed special help from God to deal with their gifts, lest those gifts should prove a curse to them, and they did not get that special help. Absalom devoted the rest of his life to avenging his sister, even to the point of attempting to usurp the place that God had given to his father. He attempted this usurpation with an amazing patience and cunningness for forty years (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Samuel+15%3A7">II&nbsp;Samuel 15:7</a>) and successfully stole the hearts of Israel. His brother also attempted to seize the throne toward the end of David&#8217;s life (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Kings+1%3A5">I&nbsp;Kings 1:5</a>), and we are given an insight into their raising. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Kings+1%3A6" title="I&nbsp;Kings 1:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Kings 1:6)</span></a></span> Their father&#8217;s indulgence played a big part in their rebellion. David spoiled his boys by not &#8220;displeasing&#8221; them. There is no doubt that he loved them (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Samuel+18%3A33">II&nbsp;Samuel 18:33</a>). In spite of David&#8217;s love for his boys, he failed them. He failed them because he did not cross them and contradict them as he should have. He failed them because God left him to do the best he could by himself. As Eli and Samuel (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Samuel+3%3A13%3B+8%3A5">I&nbsp;Samuel 3:13; 8:5</a>), he did not restrain his sons.</p>

<p>I will here quote from a tract on child raising:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">We do not claim to be an expert in the raising and care of children. Generally those who have no children, or at the most only one, two, or three, can (or think they can) tell you just how to raise your children. We have six children, three boys and three girls (the youngest are twins, a boy and a girl), now grown and all married.</p>

<p>We just want to give from experience some thoughts on correcting children which we have found to be good in causing the child to respect and obey. In the first place, parents should not speak or do anything that they would not want their child to do, then or later, as the child is watching your actions and deeds. It would seem wrong to the child for you to correct or punish it for a thing that you were doing. And would it not be wrong?</p>

</blockquote>


<p>I knew a man with a large family who prided himself on how he trained his boys. He had one daughter; all the rest were boys, and they behaved quite well because they were all scared of Daddy. He had them under control. They did not dare to misbehave. He had been in the military, and he ruled his house with military-like precision. It appeared impressive at first acquaintance. Eventually, they grew up, as boys will do, and with the exception of one, they did not live right. Even the one that lived right had problems. Daddy was a hypocrite. He did not live what he enforced. He did not win their hearts. He compelled obedience, but not from the heart level. In fact, he was mean and untrustworthy.</p>

<p>By contrast, I knew another man who had two sons. He whipped them when they misbehaved, and they resented it. They did not appreciate the restraint. Then another act of disobedience occurred, and retribution was upon them. Daddy was fixing to whip them. Then he did a strange thing. <i>He broke down and cried.</i> He said, &#8220;God knows I don&#8217;t want to whip my boys, but I must. I want them to grow up to be good men.&#8221; By this time, the boys were crying, too. The whipping went on, <i>but the boys were already whipped inside.</i> They had been touched at the heart level. It was overwhelmingly evident that Daddy was chastising them because it needed to be done, not just because he was bigger and could.</p>

<p>A mother was deeply provoked by her child. He had tried her immensely in the most aggravating way possible. Chastisement was needed. The mother seized the child. &#8220;You little imp!&#8221; she said. The Spirit of God convicted her of what she said. She was a saved woman and received <i>her chastisement</i> even as she was administering chastisement to her son. The switch was in her hand, and she was about to commence with the whipping. But before she whipped the child, <i>she apologized</i>. I was that child, and the fact that Mother asked my forgiveness for calling me an imp hit me hard. I fully deserved to be called an imp, for I was doing a pretty good imitation of one from the bowels of hell; but the <i>sincerity</i> of Mother&#8217;s efforts to deal with me cut me to the heart. It helped me to see <i>how</i> wrong I was. It was not just that Mother was displeased with me. I was wrong. I was wrong, before God, before heaven, before everything important, noble, and right. It was not merely a calculated effort on Mother&#8217;s part to work on me she was trying to do right, too.</p>

<p>The first governors of the child, typically the parents, are the early pioneers in encountering the subtility and deceptiveness of the child&#8217;s unregenerated human heart. <i>It defies analysis.</i> <span class="scripture">&#8220;The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+17%3A9" title="Jeremiah 17:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jeremiah 17:9)</span></a></span></p>

<p>We tend to read into the actions of the child what is in our heart. If we are affectionate, loving, and empathetic, then we notice hopeful appearing things in the child. If we are suspicious, morose, and distrusting, we will interpret the child&#8217;s actions in that light. And so on: jealousy, hardness, indulgence, wickedness, fanaticism, and pride. These thoughts are all our own imaginings. The reality is that the human heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked <i>beyond</i> the asserted will of the little baby. It is a thing <i>by nature</i> (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+2%3A3">Ephesians 2:3</a>). This nature produces a sinner one who deliberately and rebelliously offends before God. The little sinner will take any one of thousands of paths of disobedience and be condemned before God. It does this before it knows any better, therefore knows no condemnation; but a day comes when the child <i>does</i> know and is accountable to God.</p>

<p>To be a saved parent is to size this up correctly and to know that the only good ending to this is repentance from the heart and inspired faith in the mighty Savior. The only other end will be rejection of the striving of the Holy Spirit and a final destination in hell at the end of the way. To be a saved parent is to be an humbled ambassador who represents God to the child. With the Apostle Paul, we are compelled to confess, <span class="scripture">&#8220;And who is sufficient for these things?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+2%3A16" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 2:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 2:16)</span></a></span> Godly parenting is to respond to the call, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+6%3A8" title="Isaiah 6:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 6:8)</span></a></span> with a burdened heart, crying to God for what we need to meet the burden of the hour.</p>

<p>Make no mistake. To be a parent is to be a foot soldier in the trenches. It is to endure hardship as becometh a good soldier of Jesus Christ. It is to be a little pastor to a little flock wherein much more is taught by example than by tongue, yet there is definite, critical work for the tongue, the knees, and the will, as well. It is to give your heart, your mind, your nerves, yes, your very life to the struggle against sin in the inward parts of your child. You have no chance at all without being used and greatly helped by the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>It is a wise parent who tarries at the Pentecostal altar until he or she is endued with power from on high. If Jesus is <i>everything</i> to you indeed, and you are <i>filled</i> with the Spirit, then you will be helped to see things as He sees them, and you can work the works of God in your family. You will see firsthand the desperate struggle of the Spirit of God as He strives to enlighten and convict the sinful soul of its need. God has thus planned to give us a little part in the great battle of right against wrong. It is your privilege to be an earthen vessel in the great conflict with stakes of the highest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">One of our boys, when eight or nine years of age, began to slip money. Wife would lay some change on the cupboard shelf and would sometimes miss a nickel or a dime. We suspected this boy of taking it, but refrained from accusing him of it. We prayed about it, asking God to clearly uncover the matter in some way.</p>

<p>One day while I was working in the office, wife came in and told me that our oldest boy had missed a quarter from his money and that he was accusing the other boy of taking it. He was stirring around about it considerably and said that he saw him eating candy and felt sure that he had bought it with his money. This news made us feel bad, for we felt it would be a serious thing to charge the boy of stealing, should he not be guilty. With heavy hearts, we fell on our faces before God and asked Him to give us wisdom in the matter so the boy could be corrected and taught a lesson that he would not forget. After the day&#8217;s work was done, we went to the house and called the boy to us. We told him that we were feeling bad and very much grieved for we had always taught him to do right. As we continued to speak, he burst into tears and confessed taking the money. We talked to him of the wrong of this and what it would lead to, and told him that it was needful for us to whip him for this as it was too great a thing to let go, and that we wanted him to remember not to do that way any more. Also, he was to pay back the money just as fast as he got it, so his wrongs would all be made right. We have never had reason since that time to think that he ever took any more money. In this time of need, we simply looked to God for wisdom, and all came out well, and so it will in all things that perplex and puzzle us. As we look to God, He will untangle and show us how, when, and what to do.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Judges+13%3A12">Judges 13:12</a>, we read of Samson&#8217;s father. He did a wise thing. He asked of God through His angel how to go about the task of rearing the child. <span class="scripture">&#8220;How shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him?&#8221;</span> We have no reason to believe that Samson&#8217;s parents did not do all they could to raise Samson properly, <i>yet Samson did not respond as he should.</i> In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Judges+14%3A3">Judges 14:3</a>, we observe a willfulness in this boy that did not augur well for the future. (It is true that God used Samson&#8217;s stubborn desire for a heathen wife to restrain the Philistines, but this sinfulness in Samson was a bad thing, nevertheless.)</p>

<p>In this business of raising the next generation, there is no guarantee that our children will turn out well. That is between them and God. It cannot be otherwise. We cannot take away their right to choose right or wrong by how well we do our job. Some have felt that <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+22%3A6">Proverbs 22:6</a> means that our children cannot possibly go astray if we train them up well. They would have us believe that if the child goes astray, he was not trained as he should be. The scripture reads, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.&#8221;</span> If the child is trained in the ways of righteousness, it will leave a lifelong impression which the individual will never completely be able to escape.</p>

<p>This was true in the case of Samson. He was blessed in his early life, but lost a lot of that blessing in his more mature years because of his sinfulness. He retained his supernatural strength as long as he kept the conditions God had commanded, but even before he broke those conditions, it is painfully evident that Samson&#8217;s life was a wretched disappointment. There was no happy home. There were no nurtured children. There was no beneficial relationship with a loving wife. Instead, we see the unequal yokes, the mutual exploitation, the restless, loveless, and selfish parodies of two-becoming-one. We see the lack of prayer in Samson&#8217;s life&#8212;there is <i>so</i> little of it! Finally, he is reduced to blindness and slavery. How could it be otherwise? Many today, who are &#8220;successful&#8221; in the world, are really in the same condition. Standing in the great hall, mocked and ridiculed by his enemies in the very last hour of his life, <i>he remembers the God of his upbringing.</i> He prays and God is entreated of him. <span class="scripture">&#8220;When he is old, he will not depart from it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>The great heavenly Parent suffers constantly at the rejection and rebellion of sinful children, yet continually pursues and exercises a loving oversight and responsibility toward each member of the human family upon the face of the earth. He gives us a little part in this. If we take our responsibility to heart and cry earnestly to God for assistance, we become closer to God. It reveals to us our great need and plays a part in preparing us for our eternal home. It is a great privilege to be an earthen vessel parent.</p>

<h1>Cream Pies</h1>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;She perceiveth that her merchandise is good.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+31%3A18" title="Proverbs 31:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 31:18)</span></a></span></p>

<p>King Lemuel&#8217;s mother&#8217;s advice and desire was for him to look for a girl who was industrious and who could produce good results. Now good results take more than just a fast shot at any given thing. Good results come from time and time again doing a certain thing. This applies to the subject we have today.</p>

<p>I recall the first lemon pie a young girl made from a box mix. After the meal was over, her mother gently asked if she had used water for the liquid. The young cook had not carefully read the instructions on the box, but just took it for granted that it was like the coconut or chocolate mixes, which called for milk! That first lemon pie was not clear and lemony, but she never forgot the lesson. Be sure you carefully read the instructions and go by them! If your cream pies still haven&#8217;t been the best, don&#8217;t be discouraged. Keep trying, and note the results on the recipe. Next time, perhaps it can be altered and made more palatable! Analyze what could have perhaps made it better and jot that down to try next time. Research at the library is very helpful in answering any question you may have. A lot of time can be saved by reading about what others have learned by experimentation.</p>

<p>When we were selling pies in our community, we desired to deliver a really good product for the money. What could be done about the meringues weeping and the crust around the edge all becoming soggy by the second day? Or the whipped cream turning watery! Pumpkin pie crusts tend to be soft, too. What could be done about these problems?</p>

<p>We trust that the following recipes and tips, that have been discovered to solve the above problems, will be of value to you in serving your family and friends &#8220;good merchandise.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">Before slicing a meringue-covered pie, take the knife and slice through margarine.</p>
</div>



<hr class="minor" />
<h2>Chocolate Pie</h2>
<p><i>The use of half water and half milk gives a clear chocolate flavor. Honey also enhances the flavor of chocolate and makes it silky smooth!</i></p>

<li>1 c. water</li>

<li>1 c. milk</li>

</ul>
<p>In small bowl combine:</p>

<ul class="recipe">

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">Two ways to keep scum from forming while filling is cooling. Stir often or cover with saran wrap, so that it makes contact with top of filling.</p>
</div>



<hr class="minor" />
<h2>Coconut Cream Pie</h2>
<p><i>Corn syrup gives it smoothness.</i></p>

<p>In double boiler heat:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>2 c. milk</li>

</ul>
<p>In small bowl combine:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>1/2 c. sugar</li>

<li>1/4 c. flour</li>

<li>1/3 c. cornstarch</li>

<li>pinch of salt</li>

</ul>

<li>3 large egg yolks</li>

<li>2 T. corn syrup</li>

<li>1/4 c. milk</li>

</ul>
<p>Pour into hot milk and stir constantly with a whisk, beating out any lumps as it thickens. Remove from heat and add:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>1/2 t. double strength vanilla</li>

<li>1/4 t. coconut flavor</li>

<li>2 t. butter or margarine</li>

<li>1/3 c. flaked coconut</li>

</ul>
<p>Cool until &#8220;just warm&#8221; before pouring into baked crust.</p>

<p>Cover with fine cake crumbs and top with meringue and a generous sprinkling of coconut and bake till browned.</p>

<p>Variations:</p>

<p>For <b>Banana Cream</b>: substitute banana flavor for the coconut; omit coconut flakes and fold in 2 large, thinly sliced bananas.</p>

<p>For <b>Butterscotch</b>: substitute 2/3 c. brown sugar for the white; omit all coconut.</p>


<hr class="minor" />
<h2>Meringue</h2>
<p><i>This cornstarch mixture helps to stabilize, makes it tender and easier to slice. It also does not shrink as much or overcook as easily as meringues without it.</i></p>

<p>In small sauce pan place:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>2 t. cornstarch</li>

<li>1/4 c. cool water</li>

</ul>
<p>Let stand 1 minute. Then stir well.</p>

<p>Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. The mixture will be thick and slightly cloudy.</p>

<p>Let it cool for a couple of minutes, while preparing the egg whites.</p>

<p><i>Have utensils absolutely free of grease and egg whites without a trace of yolk.</i></p>

<p>Place in mixer bowl:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>3 large egg whites</li>

<li>1/8 t. salt</li>

<li>1/4 t. cream of tartar</li>

<li>1/4 t. vanilla</li>

</ul>
<p>Add the above cornstarch gel, a tablespoon at a time, while beating the egg white mixture.</p>

<p>Beat until soft peaks form.</p>

<p>Add:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>T. sugar, one T. at a time</li>

</ul>
<p>Continue beating until the peak does not fall when the beater is lifted.</p>

<p>Spoon onto pie filling, being sure to seal well at the crust. If it is not sealed well at all points, it will pull away during baking. Bake at 325&deg;-350&deg; for 12-15 minutes. If using convection oven, bake at 315&deg; for 7-8 minutes or until nicely browned. If you have the option of convection bake, by all means use it. It really seems to produce a better meringue with less weeping. Perhaps it is the dry hot air.</p>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">To avoid little sugar drops or beading and also shrinkage, cool meringues in a warm place, away from cold drafts.</p>
</div>


<div class="blurb"><p class="first">A tip that is really worth the effort: Finely crumb a cake donut, or use fine yellow cake crumbs and sprinkle a thin layer over the warm filling. If there is any leakage from the meringue, the crumbs absorb it. Especially when using the yellow cake crumbs, not a single crumb is detected upon slicing the pie!</p>
</div>



<hr class="minor" />
<h2>Whipped Cream</h2>
<p><i>For two pies. Gelatin and powdered sugar are the stabilizing secrets.</i></p>

<p>In mixer bowl pour:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>1 c. cream</li>

</ul>
<p>While beating on medium high, slowly sprinkle in:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>1/2 t. unflavored gelatin</li>

</ul>
<p>Continue beating and add:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>4 T. powdered sugar</li>

<li>1/2 t. double strength vanilla</li>

</ul>
<p>Care is needed to beat just until it forms soft to medium peaks. With long­er beating, it will lose its smoothness and start looking rough. Stop beating or you will have butter instead of whipped cream! Put on cold pie filling in decorative swirls. Never put on a warm pie filling. It must be cold all the way through to keep the whipped cream from melting. Keep refrigerated until ready to serve.</p>

<p>If you have trouble with the fast, easy way of just sprinkling the gelatin in, you may try softening 1/8 t. gelatin with 2 T. cream in a cup. After stirring and softening for 5 minutes, set cup in bowl of hot water to dissolve gelatin. Pour 7/8 c. cream in mixer bowl, adding the softened gelatin, powdered sugar and vanilla and beat.</p>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">Another way of getting gelatin in is to bring 2 T. marshmallow cream to room temperature, and add to cream before starting to beat. If you try adding it while beating, it may just end up wound around the top of the beaters! You will need to stop the mixer and scrape the bowl to help get the marshmallow cream mixed in. Adding a softened marshmallow didnt work. It immediately hardened up again upon contact with the cold cream!</p>
</div>



<hr class="minor" />
<h3>To avoid soggy Pumpkin Pie Crust:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Roll the pie crust extra thick and use a pyrex pie plate.</li>

<li>Beat the eggs that are to be put in the filling. Using a pastry brush, paint the inside of the unbaked pie crust with a little of the beaten eggs. Place in refrigerator to dry the egg coating, while mixing the remainder of the filling.</li>

<li>Or press 1-1/2 T. graham cracker crumbs into bottom and up sides of crust. Bake at 350&deg; for 15 minutes. It may puff up a little. Just press down again with spoon. Then pour in filling and bake in the lower one-third of oven. (These graham cracker crumbs, pressed in before baking, also make for an extra crispy crust for cream pies.)</li>

<li>Adding 1 to 2 T. flour to your favorite filling recipe will help it firm up and not get watery. Baking at too high heat will make it watery, so keep the heat down to 325&deg;!</li>

</ol>
<p>The pie crust recipe appeared in issue <a href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_9/Nothing_Like_a_Freshly_Made_Pie/index.html" title="Foundation Truth 9/Nothing Like a Freshly-Made Pie">Number 9</a>. One reader reported that it seemed to be too oily. There are differences in brands of flour and whether you sifted the flour or not. Just use a little less oil or a little more flour to fit your needs. Or you could add a couple tablespoons of wheat germ. I know from experience that if you cut the oil too much, the dough is harder to roll out. On warm days, I have rolled the ball of dough in flour before rolling out. Also, the dough needs to be rolled out right away, and not allowed to set or the oil begins to seep out. Hope this helps those of you who had trouble.</p>

<p>The above coconut filling recipe was shared with another sister. When she made it, her pie turned out much more stiff than desirable. In trying to figure out the reason, we compared our dry measuring cups. How surprised we were to discover that not all measuring cups are created equal! Hers were a little bigger! She adjusted the flour and cornstarch and tried it again, with much better results. These recipes, tips and information have all been passed down from mothers, grandmothers, aunts, friends, books, and newspaper clippings. Thank you all so much. Now it is up to us to use them and pass them on to our daughters and teach them the value of &#8220;good merchandise.&#8221;</p>

<p>May God bless and help you in your learning and teaching experiences,</p>

<p class="noindent first">Dear Princesses,</p>

<p>I am the father of three daughters, varying in age from 11 to 24. I want to share with you a chapter from <i>Beautiful Girlhood</i>, by Mabel Hale, because I have found the truth illustrated in the lives of my daughters so compelling. To the extent they get these oils in their lives, I find my home to be an early glimpse of heaven. Certainly I add some of the friction that is referred to in the following, as a father who must sometimes overrule their wishes, as another member of the home who arrives home in the evening tired and hungry, and simply as another human being with my own faults and mysteries. To my own daughters, God bless you for the help you so often are, and my prayers are with you to gain still more ground in this area. To all you other daughters, sisters, and young ladies, whether still in your parents&#8217; home or in homes of your own now, may I commend to you the following.</p>

<p class="signature">Sincerely,
<br />The Editor</p>

<h1>The Oils of Life</h1>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first"><span class="scripture">&#8220;Mercy and truth preserve the king.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+20%3A28" title="Proverbs 20:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 20:28)</span></a></span></p>

<p>The great engine upon the track might have every part complete, with fire in the box and steam in the boiler, but it will not go as it should unless it is well oiled. While perfect workmanship and fire and water are all necessary, the oil is needed also.</p>

<p>Just so it is with our lives. We may build high ideals and have lofty aspirations, may do many good deeds and be prepared for usefulness in many ways, but if there is not in our lives the oils that lubricate the machinery of life, we shall be unable to make progress. You have heard the creak and groan of wheels that needed oil, and you may have tried to use a machine whose oil cups had become dry, friction dragging the whole machine. Unoiled lives are just the same, running hard, with much complaining. You can tell them by their lamentations and murmurings, and by the friction they produce.</p>

<p>There is the oil of kindness, which should go down into the heart, and which, working out from there, will make the daily life go smoothly. In fact, this oil is of little use if it does not go down into the heart; for any that is only put on the tongue or over some special act for the time being will soon wear off and leave the machine as creaky as before. But she who gets kindness down into her heart will find it working out in her words and actions until she becomes a constant blessing in the household.</p>

<p>One who has kindness of heart is able to look upon the failings of others with consideration and patience, for she remembers that she herself is not without fault. She who has this precious oil in her life is not saying cutting things and giving way to hard speeches, which wound and hurt her companions.</p>

<p>Another oil very good to put on with kindness is called politeness. Used alone it does not do thorough work, because it does not reach every part. It will help in conduct toward those who are higher or of more apparent consequence, but the tongue and actions will be rough as toward the poor and old and weak. But politeness with kindness makes a very smooth and pleasant combination of oils. Only when politeness is used in this way will it show a genuine character. Little courtesies help along very much in oiling life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; and, &#8220;If you please,&#8221; are two short phrases that oil a request and make it smooth and pleasing to the one receiving it. &#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; and, &#8220;Please excuse me,&#8221; are two more little polite remarks that make good lubricants.</p>

<p>To rise and give your seat to an older person, to show particular courtesy to the aged, to speak respectfully to and about the old and infirm, are little things, but they make glad the hearts of the aged pilgrims through life and cause their faces to shine. It has been said that these little courtesies are like air cushions, nothing in them, yet they still the jars of life immensely. Let us have plenty of them to help us over the bumps of life.</p>

<p>Kind thoughts are also a good oil to place on troubled waters. If one will, by God&#8217;s help, always keep his thoughts of those about him kind and forgiving, no matter how trying things may be, then he can go along without friction. Every unkind word and act is the result of some unkind thought. And some of these thoughts bear fruit almost immediately. So long as I can keep a thought of kindness in my heart I can treat my brother well.</p>

<p>Patience is another oil much needed in life&#8217;s machinery. There is so much that tends to annoy and fret a girl, that goes crosswise to what she wants it to go, there are so many days that she has to spend doing things she does not care to do, so many disappointments and little vexing things, that if she does not keep well oiled with patience she is liable to become cross and sharp-spoken. When anyone in a home runs low with patience it is keenly felt by all the rest. The expression of the countenance, the tone of the voice, the manner of speaking&#8212;all tell instantly that patience has run low. Every girl needs a good supply of this precious lubricant, which not only smoothes the rough places but gives to the life a fragrance that is very pleasant. She who is both kind and patient is always desirable.</p>

<p>Thoughtfulness and consideration are two more oils needed in any home. The members of a family live so closely together that when one member is rusty it affects all the rest, more or less. On the other hand, if the daughter of a family can keep always well oiled in tongue and spirit with kindness, thoughtfulness, and patience, her sunny, pleasant smile will drive the shadows away and bring the sunlight into the home.</p>

<p>When I find that I am getting sore and fretted with the annoyance of someone rubbing me the wrong way, I may know that my oil cup is getting low; for when I have plenty of the oils of life I can stand a great deal of rubbing without getting peevish. And again, if I find I am rubbing someone else till he or she is getting all worn, I had better look; it may be that I am rough and need to stop the friction of my own acts with more oil.</p>

<p>The place to go to get fresh supplies of these precious oils is at the throne of God. Every girl who will seek may have of Him all the grace she needs to keep her life running sweet and smooth in her home and in her school, or wherever she may be. Or if she must be with those who are full of friction and strife, she may, in spite of it all, be so covered with the precious, gentle oils that the sweetness and smoothness of her life will have a quieting effect.</p>

<p>Culture takes leisure, elegance, wide margins of time, a pocketbook; drudgery means limitations, coarseness, crowded hours, chronic worry, old clothes, black hands, headaches. Our real and our ideal are not twins. Never were! I want the books, but the clothes basket wants me. I love nature and figures are my fate. My taste is books and I farm. My taste is art and I correct exercises. My taste is science and I measure tape.</p>

<p>Can it be that this drudgery, not to be escaped, gives &#8220;culture&#8221;? Yes, culture of the prime elements of life, of the very fundamentals of all fine manhood and fine womanhood, the fundamentals that underlie all fullness and without which no other culture worth the winning is even possible. Power of attention, power of industry, promptitude in beginning work, method and accuracy and dispatch in doing it, perseverance, courage before difficulties, cheer, self-control and self-denial&#8212;they are worth more than Latin and Greek and French and German and music and art and painting and wax flowers and travels in Europe added together. The latter are the decorations of a man&#8217;s life, those first things are the indispensables. They make one&#8217;s sitfast strength and one&#8217;s active momentum&#8212;they are the solid substance of one&#8217;s self.</p>

<p>Father and mother and the ancestors before them have done much to bequeath those mental qualities to us, but that which scrubs them into us, the clinch which makes them actually ours and keeps them ours, and adds to them as the years go by&#8212;that depends on our own plod in the rut, our drill of habit; in a word, our &#8220;drudgery.&#8221; It is because we have to go and go morning after morning, through rain, through shine, through toothache, headache, heartache to the appointed spot and do the appointed work, no matter what our work may be, because of the rut, plod, grind, humdrum in the work, that we get our foundations.</p>

<p>Drudgery is the gray angel of success, for drudgery is the doing of one thing long after it ceases to be amusing, and it is <span class="scripture">&#8220;this one thing I do&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+3%3A13" title="Philippians 3:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 3:13)</span></a></span> that gathers me together from my chaos, that concentrates me from possibilities to powers and turns powers into achievements. The aim in life is what the backbone is in the body, if we have no aim we have no meaning. Lose us and the earth has lost nothing, no niche is empty, no force has ceased to play, for we have no aim and therefore we are still&#8212;nobody. Our bodies are known and answer in this world to such or such a name, but, as to our inner selves, with real and awful meaning our walking bodies might be labeled, &#8220;An unknown man sleeps here&#8221;!</p>

<p>But we can be artists also in our daily task&#8212;artists not artisans. The artist is he who strives to perfect his work, the artisan strives to get through it. If I cannot realize my ideal I can at least idealize my real. How? By trying to be perfect in it. If I am but a raindrop in a shower, I will be at least a perfect drop. If but a leaf in a whole June, I will be a perfect leaf.</p>

<p>This is the beginning of all Gospels, that the kingdom of heaven is at hand just where we are.</p>

<h1>The Cup of Consolation</h1>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+116%3A13" title="Psalm 116:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 116:13)</span></a></span></p>

<p>I was sitting on the floor in the sewing room when the call came. It was dark because I felt still the sting of the unkind words I had let slip to my sister after a very trying day. I sat, savoring the sweetness of God&#8217;s forgiveness and His promise to help me to not lose my temper the next hard day He would send, when through the darkness came His voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to go with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>My heart skipped a beat. What was that He had said?</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to go with <i>her</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>With her? To live with her? <i>What?</i> Why, I just failed to be patient with her! Was He really asking me to <i>live</i> with her? He must mean while she was living here at our parents. Surely. Yes, that must be what He meant.</p>

<p>My eyes were becoming accustomed to the dimness of the room; I could see my sewing machine outlined against the dusky sky. Soon it would be dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to <i>go</i> with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Involuntarily I shivered, and instantly wondered why&#8212;it was not cold.</p>

<p>No, the room was not cold at all, but my heart­&#8212;oh, dismay&#8212;my heart was as cold as ice. For I was afraid.</p>

<p>It was strange to be afraid. For why should I be? My mother, grandmother, and, as I had heard, my great-grandmothers were wonderful homemakers. My sister was good at it, too. She often said I could do it&#8212;if I would just try.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I do try, and try hard,&#8221; I protested to the darkening sky, &#8220;and it never works like them. I don&#8217;t have the knack, they must possess some secret that they don&#8217;t even know, because it makes them happy. Mind that! <i>Happy!</i> And through my mind rushed painful memories: of beans that weren&#8217;t ready on time, and of making the meal very inconveniently late. Of ill timing and wrong ingredients, of getting terribly confused with substitutes and new techniques, of accidently making chili so hot on more than one occasion that my dad could not even swallow it. Of being so frustrated with my own stupidity that I wished one never had to eat. And my poor mom! She, who deserved a much less dumb daughter had to keep patiently attempting to teach me. And I was going to make a failure out of her!</p>

<p>My eyes filled with tears of shame as I looked down. My Bible was down there on the floor somewhere&#8212;but&#8212;what was the use? I had so valiantly tried; He had said He would help me, but, well, I must be too stupid; maybe He had changed His mind.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;My grace is sufficient for thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+12%3A9" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 12:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 12:9)</span></a></span> The bright yellow letters appeared on the floor where my tears had fallen. And then His voice: &#8220;<i>My</i> grace is <b>sufficient</b> for <i>thee</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>That word <i>sufficient</i> rang in my head&#8212;it meant enough. &#8220;Do you have sufficient cash to purchase such and such?&#8221; Yes, that was what it meant&#8212;enough to cover the need. My need? He had enough to cover my need?</p>

<p>The answer was yes. And yes. And yes again. Praise Him!</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<div class="left"><img src="../../Foundation_Truth_11/consolation_flower24.jpg" alt="" width="75" height="361" /></div>
<p>And so we moved&#8212;my sister, the baby she&#8217;s adopting, and I&#8212;to a little mobile home in a quiet park just miles down the road from my parents.</p>

<p>I had promised, and I meant to keep my promise if it killed me. And I was sure it was going to kill me. All I knew how to do was the laundry, and take care of the baby. I had made main meals at home in my mom&#8217;s kitchen, with the familiar pots and ingredients. If I thought it was bad cooking at my mom&#8217;s, well, here it was impossible. And the first meals reflected it&#8212;two of them my sister could not eat. (Because of my hunger, I ate them. Like camping, I ruefully thought, one gets so hungry they can eat practically anything.) I was sure I was going to be a failure; but every time I told it to Him, He&#8217;d look quite confidently at me, and a far-away look would come into His eye and He&#8217;d say, &#8220;<i>My grace is sufficient for thee.</i>&#8221; It was like He had remeasured and, yes, He was absolutely certain that there was enough sufficiency to cover my very obvious need.</p>

<p>One evening, after another exhausting day, I tried out a new section in <i>The Works of John Bunyan</i>. And what I read gripped me, for it seemed written just for me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">These vessels therefore were for some other use than for formal worship in the house of the forest of Lebanon. The best way then, that I know of, to find out what they were is first to consider to what they are joined in the mention of them. Now I find them joined in the mention of them with Solomon&#8217;s drinking vessels, and since as they were made of fine or pure gold, I take them also to be vessels of the same kind, namely, vessels to drink in. Now if we join to this the state of the church in the wilderness, of which, as we have said, this house of the forest of Lebanon was a type, then we must understand that by these vessels were prefigured such draughts as the church has, when in a bewildered or persecuted state. And they are of two sorts: either, first, such as are exceeding bitter; or, second, such as are exceeding sweet; for both these attend a state of war.</p>

<p>First. Such as are exceeding bitter. These are called cups of red wine, signifying blood; also, the cup of the Lord&#8217;s fury, the cup of trembling, the cup of astonishment, etc. (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+75%3A8%3B+Isaiah+51%3A17%2C22%3B+Jeremiah+25%3A15%3B+Ezekiel+23%3A33">Psalm 75:8; Isaiah 51:17,22; Jeremiah 25:15; Ezekiel 23:33</a>). Nor is there anything more natural to the church, while in a wilderness condition, than such cups and draughts as these. Hence she, as there, is said to be clothed, as was said afore, in sackcloth, to mourn, to weep, to cry out, and to be in pain, as is a woman in travail. See the Lamentations and you will find all this verified. See also <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+11%3A3%2C+12%3A2">Revelation 11:3, 12:2</a>. And whoso considers what has already been said as to what the house of the forest of Lebanon met with, will find that what is here inferred is not foreign but natural. For, can it be imagined, that when the king of Assyria laid down his army by the sides of Lebanon, and when the fire was to devour her cedars, also when Lebanon was to be cut down and languish, that these vessels, these cups, were not then put into her hand. And I say again, since the church in the wilderness, Lebanon&#8217;s antitype, has been so persecuted, so distressed, so oppressed, and made the seat of so much war, so much blood, of so many murders of her children within her, etc., can it be imagined that she drank of none of these cups? Yes, yes, she has drank the red wine at the Lord&#8217;s hand, even the cup of blood, of fury, of trembling, and of astonishment; witness her own cries, sighs, tears, and tremblings, with the cries of widows, children, and orphans within her (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Lamentations+1%2C+2%2C+4%2C+5">Lamentations 1, 2, 4, 5</a>).</p>

<p>But why cite particular texts, since reason, histories, experience, anything that is intelligible, will confirm this for a truth; namely, that a people whose profession is directly in opposition to the devil and Antichrist, and to all debauchery, inhumanity, profaneness, superstition, and idolatry, when suffered to be invaded by the dragon, the beast, the false prophet, and whore, must needs taste of these cups, and drink thereof, to their astonishment. But all these are of pure gold. They are of God&#8217;s ordaining, appointing, filling, timing, and also sanctified by him for good to those of his that drink them. Hence Moses chose rather to drink a brimmer of these, <span class="scripture">&#8220;than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+11%3A25" title="Hebrews 11:25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 11:25)</span></a></span> The sourness, bitterness, and wormwood of them, therefore, is only to the flesh that loveth neither God, nor Christ, nor grace (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+75%3A8%3B+Philippians+1%3A28">Psalm 75:8; Philippians 1:28</a>). The afflictions, therefore, that the church in the wilderness hath met with, these cups of gold, are of more worth than are all the treasures of Egypt; they are needful and profitable, and praiseworthy also, and tend to the augmenting of our glory when the next world is come (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+3%3A3%3B+Revelation+2%3A10%3B+1+Peter+1%3A6">I&nbsp;Thessalonians 3:3; Revelation 2:10; I&nbsp;Peter 1:6</a>). Besides they are signs, tokens, and golden marks of love, and jewels that set off the beauty of the church in the sight of God the more (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+6%3A17%3B+Revelation+3%3A19%3B+Hebrews+12%3A6">Galatians 6:17; Revelation 3:19; Hebrews 12:6</a>). They are also a means by which men are proved sound, honest, faithful, and true lovers of God, as also such whose graces are not counterfeit, feigned, or unsound, but true, and such as will be found to praise, and honour, and glory, at the appearing of Jesus Christ (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+27%3A9%3B+Hebrews+12%3A7-10%3B+1+Peter+2%3A19%3B+2+Corinthians+4%3A17-18%3B+2+Thessalonians+1%3A5">Isaiah 27:9; Hebrews 12:7-10; I&nbsp;Peter 2:19; II&nbsp;Corinthians 4:17-18; II&nbsp;Thessalonians 1:5</a>). And this has been the cause that the men of our church in the wilderness have gloried in tribulation, taking pleasure in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, and in distresses for Christ&#8217;s sake (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+5%3A3%3B+2+Corinthians+12%3A9-10">Romans 5:3; II&nbsp;Corinthians 12:9-10</a>). Yea, this is the reason why they have bidden one another rejoice when they fell into divers temptations, saying, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Blessed is the man that endureth temptation,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+1%3A12" title="James 1:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 1:12)</span></a></span> and, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Behold, we count them happy which endure.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+5%3A11" title="James 5:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 5:11)</span></a></span> And again, <span class="scripture">&#8220;if ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+4%3A14" title="I&nbsp;Peter 4:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 4:14)</span></a></span> These therefore are vessels of pure gold, though they contain such bitter draughts, and though such as at which we make so many wry faces before we can get their liquor down.</p>

<p>Do you think that a Christian, having even this cup in his hand to drink it, would change it for a draught of that which is in the hand of the woman that sits on the back of the scarlet-coloured beast? (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+17%3A3-4">Revelation 17:3-4</a>). No, verily, for he knows that her sweet is poison, and that his bitter is to purge his soul, body, life, and religion, of death (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A11-12">II&nbsp;Timothy 2:11-12</a>). God sends His love tokens to His church two ways, sometimes by her friends, sometimes by her enemies. When they come by the hand of a friend, as by a minister, a brother, or by the Holy Ghost, then they come smoothly, sweetly, and are taken, and go down like honey. But when these love tokens come to them by the hand of an enemy, then they are handed to them roughly; Pharaoh handed love tokens to them roughly; the king of Babylon handed these love tokens to them roughly. They bring them of malice, God sends them of love; they bring them and give them to us, hoping they will be our death; they give us them therefore with many a foul curse, but God blesses them still. Did not Haman lead Mordecai in his state by the hand of anger? Nor is this cup so bitter but that our Lord Himself drank deep of it before it was handed to His church; He did as loving mothers do, drink thereof Himself to show us it is not poison, also to encourage us to drink it for His sake and for our endless health (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+20%3A22%2C+26%3A39%2C42">Matthew 20:22, 26:39,42</a>). And, as I told you before, I think I do not vary from the sense of the text in calling them cups; because, though there they have no name, they are joined with king Solomon&#8217;s drinking vessels, and because as so joined in the type, so they are also joined here; therefore the cup here is called Christ&#8217;s cup. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of?&#8230;&#8203;Ye shall drink indeed of my cup.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+20%3A22-23" title="Matthew 20:22-23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 20:22-23)</span></a></span> Here you see they are joined in a communion in this cup of affliction, as the cups in one and the same breath are joined with those king Solomon drank in, which he put in the house of the forest of Lebanon.</p>

<p>I remembered Paul had said to the Colossians, <span class="scripture">&#8220;and [I] fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body&#8217;s sake.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+1%3A24" title="Colossians 1:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 1:24)</span></a></span> Naturally, I thought the suffering had been accomplished at the cross; but being presented with the fact that there was left on purpose room for me to suffer, I began to weep. For I saw, in a very real sense, how much the Savior had suffered to give me the precious gift of forgiveness. If I suffered so much in my inadequacies in learning to be a homemaker, doing my best to obey His will, how I could I even vaguely comprehend how much He had suffered that I could be changed from being a servant of sin to a child of the King! I couldn&#8217;t really comprehend; but it was beautiful to gaze upon&#8212;His love for me had gone deeper than I ever had supposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, will you drink of the cup I have drunk of already?&#8221; He gently asked me.</p>

<p>I sat on my bed, thinking. He had already tasted it&#8212;He knew it was bitter, the prayer in the garden of Gethesame showed that. His hope had seemed cut off, like He suffered in vain. He knew how I felt&#8212;who would want a girl who had had a record of being so dumb as to not pick up the joys of knowing how to put a house in order and run it with a confident hand?</p>

<p>Many others had accepted the cup of suffering, martyrs are an excellent example. It seemed they sang to me:</p>

<p>And so I pledged and promised Him that I would drink it with Him to the very last drop, for had He not said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;My grace is sufficient for thee&#8221;</span>? Yes, He had.</p>

<p>From that hour, I began to change. Mind you, not the circumstances, but <i>I</i> began to change. I found a gem of wisdom in a book about scheduling information upon which I changed a few of the ways I was doing laundry and cooking chores. And behold, the glory of the King touched and blessed the change, and I began to&#8212;yes, you guessed it&#8212;<i>enjoy</i> the laundry and cooking. They became <i>exciting</i> activities! Instead of the unshakable mindset of dumb-things-I-have-to-do (because they must be done&#8212;and how on earth can other people find pleasure in doing them?), they became alive to me, exciting to me, challenging for me to figure out their peculiar little secrets (like in cooking, and in laundry, how to be the most efficient as possible)! Yes, <span class="scripture">&#8220;the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+9%3A2" title="Isaiah 9:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 9:2)</span></a></span> For Jesus came to help those that dwell in the shadows of death, and to me those activities were as dead as a doornail, so to speak, for they did not challenge my mind whatsoever, rather they dulled it. And so God&#8217;s great light came into this home, and my heart began to glow with the riches of His grace. Every new challenge I breathed a prayer over until it became a victory, and then how my countenance did shine! It was wonderful to work with Him beside me; oh, yes, how I do love Him!</p>

<p>I had found what the martyr Pomponius Algerius meant when he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">The heat of the prison to me is coldness; the cold winter to me is a fresh spring-time in the Lord. He that feareth not to be burned in the fire, how will he fear the heat of weather? Or what careth he for the pinching frost, which burneth with the love of the Lord?</p>

<p>The place is sharp and tedious to them that be guilty; but to the innocent and guiltless it is mellifluous. Here droppeth the delectable dew; here floweth the pleasant nectar; here runneth the sweet milk; here is plenty of all good things. And although the place itself be desert and barren, yet to me it seemeth a large walk, and a valley of pleasure; here to me is the better and more noble part of the world. Let the miserable worldling say, and confess, if there be any plot, pasture, or meadow, so delightful to the mind of man, as here. Here I see kings, princes, cities, and people; here I see wars, where some be overthrown, some be victors, some thrust down, some lifted up. Here is Mount Sion; here I am already in heaven itself. Here standeth first Christ Jesus in the front; about him stand the old fathers, prophets, and evangelists, apostles, and all the servants of God; of whom some do embrace and cherish me, some exhort me, some open the sacraments unto me, some comfort me, other some are singing about me: and how then shall I be thought to be alone, among so many, and such as these be, the beholding of whom to me is both solace and example&#8230;.</p>

<p>Now then, if to die in the Lord be not to die but live most joyfully, where is this wretched worldly rebel, which blameth us of folly, for giving away our lives to death? Oh, how delectable is this death to me! To taste the Lord&#8217;s cup, which is an assured pledge of true salvation; for so hath the Lord himself forewarned us, saying, the same that they have done to me, they will also do unto you. Wherefore let the doltish world, with his blind worldlings (who in the bright sunshine, yet go stumbling in darkness, being as blind as beetles), cease thus unwisely to carp against us for our rash suffering, as they count it&#8230;.</p>

<p>Thus do we resemble Christ our Head, which said that the disciple cannot be above his master, nor the servant above his Lord. The same Lord hath also commanded that every one shall take up his cross and follow him (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+9">Luke 9</a>)</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[quoted in <i>The House of the Forest of Lebanon</i>, by John Bunyan]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>For if we take up His cross to follow Him, He will not leave us alone with the weight and gloom of it. Oh, no. He comes and changes the cross, and it becomes a treasure house, a delectable place:</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Song+of+Solomon+2%3A8" title="Song of Solomon 2:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Song of Solomon 2:8)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.

<p>Sometimes the Master seems to like the strangest places&#8212;as in a cleft of rock, or under some stairs&#8212;just tell me what is so beautiful about those places? But if you go with Him, and I quote,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Song+of+Solomon+2%3A10" title="Song of Solomon 2:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Song of Solomon 2:10)</span></a></span> it is beautiful wherever He goes, that is, if you love Him. For He is one in ten thousand.

<p>And so it was that later I picked up the now precious passage of the bitter cup, and read on:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">But these are not all the cups that belong to the house of the forest of Lebanon, or rather to the church in the wilderness; there is also a cup, out of which, at times, is drunk what is exceeding sweet. It is called the cup of consolation, the cup of salvation; a cup in the which God Himself is (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+116%3A13%3B+Jeremiah+16%3A7">Psalm 116:13; Jeremiah 16:7</a>). As he said, the Lord is the portion of my cup. Or rather, <span class="scripture">&#8220;The L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+16%3A5" title="Psalm 16:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 16:5)</span></a></span> This cup, they that are in the church in the wilderness have usually for an after-draught to that bitter one that went before. Thus, as tender mothers give their children plums or sugar, to sweeten their palate after they have drank a bitter potion, so God gives His the cups of salvation and consolation, after they have suffered awhile. <span class="scripture">&#8220;For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+1%3A5" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 1:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 1:5)</span></a></span> Hence the apostle assureth himself concerning the affliction of them at Corinth; yea, and also promiseth them, that as they were partakers of the sufferings, so should they be of the consolation (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+1%3A7">II&nbsp;Corinthians 1:7</a>).</p>

<p>Some of these cups are filled until they run over, as David said his did, when the valley of the shadow of death was before him. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Thou preparest a table before me,&#8221;</span> said he, <span class="scripture">&#8220;in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+23%3A5" title="Psalm 23:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 23:5)</span></a></span> This is that which the apostle calls exceeding; that is, that which is beyond measure. <span class="scripture">&#8220;I am,&#8221;</span> says he, <span class="scripture">&#8220;filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+7%3A4" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 7:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 7:4)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Now he has one answering the other. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Thou hast made summer and winter.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+74%3A17" title="Psalm 74:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 74:17)</span></a></span> Thou hast made the warm beams of Thy sun answerable to the cold of the dark night. This may be also yet signified by the building of this house, this type of the church in the wilderness, in so pleasant a place as the forest of Lebanon was (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Song+of+Solomon+4%3A8">Song of Solomon 4:8</a>). Lebanon! Lebanon was one of the sweetest places in all the land of Canaan. Therefore we read of the fruit of Lebanon, of the streams from Lebanon; the scent, the smell, the glory of Lebanon; and also of the wine and flowers of Lebanon (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+72%3A16%3B+Hosea+14%3A6-7%3B+Isaiah+35%3A2%2C+9%3A13%3B+Nahum+1%3A4">Psalm 72:16; Hosea 14:6-7; Isaiah 35:2, 9:13; Nahum 1:4</a>). Lebanon! That was one thing that wrought with Moses to desire that he might go over Jordan; namely, that he might see that goodly mountain, and Lebanon. The glory and excellent beauty of the church, Christ also setteth forth, by comparing of her to Lebanon. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Thy lips, O my spouse,&#8221;</span> says He, <span class="scripture">&#8220;drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are under thy tongue, and the smell of thy garment is like the smell of Lebanon.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Song+of+Solomon+4%3A11" title="Song of Solomon 4:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Song of Solomon 4:11)</span></a></span> This house, therefore, being placed here, might be to show how blessed a state God could make the state of His church by His blessed grace and presence, even while she is in a wilderness condition.</p>

<p>Girls, you may be in a wilderness condition, being unmarried, and perhaps your hope is quite dim, but look what God has for you. If we want the beauty of a home and family of our own, we must drink first the cup He gives to us, and it may be bitter to our taste. And He knows, for He has tasted it first; but when we have drained the cup to the bottom He gives to us the cup of consolation. And that cup is so very sweet&#8212;unfathomably sweet.</p>

<p>God bless you.</p>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first"><span class="scripture">&#8220;&#8230;&#8203;for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn;and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+12%3A24" title="Luke 12:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 12:24)</span></a></span></p>

<p>The day had not really been difficult. The students hadn&#8217;t been hard to handle, nor had the lessons been difficult to teach. But, as is many times the case with us, it was a few words casually said, a little consideration of the implications, and the feelings of discouragement came piling in. Perhaps, one could say, unduly. But to my mind it was real as any cloud, and an oppression upon my heart. I went to my knees in prayer to the One who said He&#8217;d bear all our loads.</p>

<p>It was at the point when I had once more surrendered myself to His will, whatever the future might hold, that He sent me these words. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Consider the ravens.&#8221;</span> And I did so. What was it about ravens that could inspire my heart just then? Ravens are just big black birds that fly around and don&#8217;t seem particularly noteworthy for any good attributes. But <span class="scripture">&#8220;God feedeth them.&#8221;</span> And as I thought about what it was to be a raven, a beautiful picture unfolded before me. Ravens don&#8217;t lay plans for future want. As they flap around the countryside in search of food, they don&#8217;t say to themselves, &#8220;Today I will go by the fields, and on the weekend there will be picnic scraps.&#8221; Or, &#8220;Here is a road kill, but I must save it for next week in case there is nothing else.&#8221; No, they simply look for food in times of need. And God provides for them.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Foundation_Truth_11/consider_raven2.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="125" /></div>
<p>How easy it is for us to <span class="scripture">&#8220;take thought&#8221;</span> and let the worries and concerns of tomorrow pile in! The lesson of the ravens is a true one. It&#8217;s not for me to plan on how I will handle tomorrow&#8217;s cares and battles. I do not need to fret or worry because next month I will have need. No, there is a God, a loving God, who sees me and cares for me. I need only come with my want today and He will provide. I need only to trust Him and lean upon Him, and commit myself into His keeping. I am glad to be one of God&#8217;s ravens.</p>

<h1>Just Mary: Part 3</h1>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">As we continue our story, the comfort of a new mother for little Mary evaporates while Uncle Roy goes off to seek his fortune in the navy. But first he must see his beloved niece&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>


<hr class="minor" />
<p>Mary started to school at the opening of the fall term when she was six years of age and made rapid progress. She was very studious and far ahead of the other children of her age. At the close of her first term of school she was promoted to the third grade and considered one of the best spellers in the country. It was not an uncommon occurrence for her to carry off the honor of being the last one on the floor during what they called their &#8220;Friday afternoon spelling matches.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dan was indeed proud of his little daughter and was a devoted father to both his children. For some months after Elsie&#8217;s death his grief seemed too deep for any consolation, but however deep the wound it will heal in time; and that was the way with Dan.</p>

<p>Elsie had been gone fourteen months when Myra Rainey came to spend the summer with her aunt who lived near the Dennisons. She came as a helper to her aunt, who was not well and who needed someone to assist her that summer, as she had several hired men to care for, and Myra was surely a splendid helper. She was twenty years of age and a beautiful girl, very pleasant and congenial, and she soon made friends in the community. As the two families lived near each other, she was often found in the Dennison home and became very much attached to Mary and Otis, and they to her. She would often come to get the children that they might be with her when she would be alone in her aunt&#8217;s home. She was always so kind and lovable to them that they soon returned that love, and when asked who they liked best of all, would often say, &#8220;Myra Rainey.&#8221; Her being in the Dennison home so often and she so fond of the children, soon won Dan&#8217;s friendship, and it was not long until this friendship became mutual between them. The following spring the two were married. Grandmother Dennison was pleased with the match, expressing herself as &#8220;just delighted&#8221; and truly she was, for she saw Myra as a kind, good girl, one who loved Dan&#8217;s children almost to adoration. Dan took her to his own home to be the mother of his children, feeling he had found a woman whom he could trust and one who loved the children almost equal to his love.</p>

<p>She seemed to be very fond of the children, and many evenings were spent in the home with the four of them gathered together, each holding a child on his lap. But this was not for long, for she soon saw how Dan adored his children and became jealous of them, and instead of coming together with them in the evening she would often say, &#8220;Dan, put the children down, or put them to bed, and then come and sit with me for a while.&#8221; Dan paid no attention, until one evening, at his invitation to take her place with them, she retorted rather sharply, &#8220;No, I thank you; when you get through with your children, if you have any time left, you may then spend that with me, but it doesn&#8217;t seem that you care for anyone or anything else but your children. I think that is all you cared to get a wife for&#8212;just to have someone to see after them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dan was very much surprised to hear such, but from that time on took notice that she had no patience with them and would often scold them sharply for the most trivial offense. A few times he tried to remonstrate only to find that the beautiful, smiling face of Myra Rainey would be changed into the appearance of an approaching tornado, and her kind words be changed into sharp ones, cutting and slashing as they went. He could not pay any particular attention to them without an outburst from her, this to be followed up by the children being severely punished in some way; so he who had once been an adoring father became one who seldom noticed his children other than to speak to them occasionally or tell them something that he wished them to do. There were no more pleasant evenings spent together and no more preparing them for bed, for Mary had this task to do.</p>

<p>Children now began coming into the Dennison home; first Caroline; then fifteen months later, Nancy; then in eighteen months the twins, Elmer and Ellen. Mary was now past nine years of age, but there was no more school for her. There was too much to be done in the home, and she could not be spared. Myra&#8217;s own children did not suffer from want of attention, but Mary and Otis could do nothing that would not bring down sharp censure. Mary worked from morning until night, doing work that was far too strenuous for one of her age, receiving no word of praise from her stepmother and occasionally a sharp censure from her father. The twins were very cross, and it was a very common occurrence for Mary to be called from her bed at night to help take care of them. Many were the family quarrels, and the once beautiful, smiling, kind-spoken Myra Rainey had developed into a quarrelsome, nagging, old scold.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>When Mary was eleven years of age, another girl, Margaret, was born into the home, only to remain a short time. And until this time Mary had given no thought of what was beyond death. There was the funeral; and the kind minister spoke of a life beyond this one which went deep into the childish heart. As he addressed the family at the close of the discourse he quoted the words of David when he said, &#8220;I cannot bring him back, but I shall go to him,&#8221; and then told of the hope of meeting after death.</p>

<p>This did not escape Mary&#8217;s ears, and she pondered it in her heart. She did not have the privilege of attending Sunday school or church services that she might be enlightened on the subject, but she thought of it often. Although Margaret had only been with them a few months, Mary had loved her dearly. And as she had the constant care of the smaller children, Mary received her first smile and her first baby coo, and if there was any chance of ever meeting her little baby sister she wanted to know just how to do it.</p>

<p>A few weeks after the death of Margaret, Mary approached her stepmother on this subject, but as she could not enlighten her, and as the question only annoyed her because of her own lack of spiritual life, she received a sharp rebuke and was sent away. But that did not erase from her mind the thought of meeting her again, and when she had an opportunity she mentioned it to her aunt Millie, who came to spend a few days with them. This aunt was the favorite sister of Dan&#8217;s, and Mary opened her heart to her aunt regarding the question of meeting little Margaret again.</p>

<p>Millie Fletcher had not been a spiritual woman until God visited in her own home and called away her own little babe. The very thing which now was puzzling Mary had come forcibly to her, and she came before God as a penitent soul and received the assurance that she would meet her darling again. When Mary pressed her question upon her she explained it as best she could to the child, and although Mary could not understand it all, she grasped this thought, that we are two people living together, a body and a soul. The body must die and go back to dust, for God made it from dust, but the soul that lives in the body goes back to God. If it has been good it will be with God and with all good people, but if it has been bad it will never see any good people any more. This was about all the conception she had of this vital truth, but as her Aunt Millie ceased talking, she threw her arms about her neck and, laying her head on her aunt&#8217;s shoulder, began to cry as she said, &#8220;Oh Aunt Millie, I mean to be good and then some day I shall go to meet little Margaret.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the days wore away into weeks, and weeks to months, the wound healed in the childish heart, and the loss of the little sister was forgotten as the work of the home was laid more and more on her. But news came to them of Grandpa Harmon&#8217;s death, and again the thought of a life beyond this one stirred in the child heart. She had loved Grandpa Harmon dearly, but now he had been called away. As her tears fell upon receiving the news of his death, there went a cry out of her heart, &#8220;I want to meet him again.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>After the death of Father Harmon, David married and offered Roy a home with him, which was accepted, but it was only for a few months, for David was so selfish that he thought all Roy&#8217;s earnings should be given over to him, although Roy was paying his board weekly. Many times he would borrow money from Roy with a promise of refunding it in a certain length of time. When Roy really needed it and would mention the fact to his brother, he would be met with resentment. At last the day came when David again asked Roy for a loan and was refused, and a quarrel ensued in which Roy took his belongings and went elsewhere. But he could not be satisfied. One day the thought of joining the navy came to him, but he must first see his little Peachy, the only one who really claimed his love since the death of his father and mother.</p>

<p>He walked into the Dennison yard unannounced. It was a surprise to all to see him, although Dan, Mary, and Otis were delighted. He received a warm welcome, but as he looked about him, a look of sadness filled his eyes. He could see that his little Peachy was neglected. Caroline, Nancy, and the twins were dressed in nice play suits, but his Peachy was shabbily dressed in faded calico, which had been patched and repatched. He saw also she was the servant in the home, for she was up early in the morning and with milk pail in hand, away to do the milking, and while the others ate breakfast, Peachy busied herself with making beds, sweeping, and straightening things about the place. Myra was a very particular housekeeper and free to find fault with anything that did not come up to her close inspection. The younger children had time for play, but not so with Peachy, for there was no time left for her from her work.</p>

<p>Roy tried in many ways to get alone with Mary, but Myra saw to it that they were not alone, for when she found them so, she would always have something else for Mary to do which would take her away from him. But he was determined, and early one morning he met her in the barn.</p>

<p>Mary was busy milking, and all unconscious of any observer. She was singing, and the tears came to his eyes; he again heard the voice of his beloved sister Elsie, now reproduced in her daughter.</p>

<p>He approached Mary, who smiled as he said, &#8220;Here, Peachy, let me try my hand at milking. It has been some time since I milked a cow.&#8221; Sitting down on the milk stool, he convinced her in a very short time that he had not forgotten how to do it, for the milk streamed into the pail and soon the foam was running over the top. Mary laughed at the expression he had used of &#8220;pailing a cow,&#8221; and this made an opening for conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you like to go to town with me today?&#8221; inquired Uncle Roy as he looked into her face from where he was sitting on the milk stool.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would I?&#8221; exclaimed Mary; &#8220;I should say that I should, but that is not to he thought of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why is it not to be thought of?&#8221; inquired Roy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Mother wouldn&#8217;t let me go,&#8221; replied Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we will ask your father,&#8221; said Roy, &#8220;and if he says it is all right she will have nothing to say then. You leave it to me, and I shall ask him as we eat breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Uncle Roy, I have nothing to wear,&#8221; quickly replied Mary as a blush spread over her face and neck and she looked away across the field.</p>

<p>They stood in the cow lot talking for some time&#8212;Roy asking, and Mary answering questions. At the close of that conversation a real resentment rose in his heart against Dan because of some things which he permitted to be done against his daughter&#8212;Roy&#8217;s own niece&#8212;who was as much Dan&#8217;s child as were the other children in the home.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall go to town today,&#8221; said Uncle Roy as they started toward the house, Roy with one arm about Peachy and with the pail of foaming milk in his hand. How Mary&#8217;s heart went out to Roy at that time, for it was the first little act of kindness or appreciation that she had had for many, many days. She lingered about as the family sat down to breakfast to hear what the outcome would be of his inquiry to go to town.</p>

<p>When Roy approached the subject to Dan, before he had time to reply, Myra answered, &#8220;Oh, no, I could not possibly spare her today, for I have so much to do.&#8221; Roy ignored her as though she had not spoken and said again to Dan, &#8220;I want to take Mary and Otis to town with me for I am leaving shortly for the navy and may never return, and I want to leave something for them to remember my last visit with them before leaving. May they go with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they may go,&#8221; said Dan, as he gave his wife a look which was meant for silence; &#8220;and I shall go with you, too. Mary, get ready,&#8221; and he rose from the table.</p>

<p>We shall not try to picture the scene in the Dennison home when Myra found that for one time she could not have her way. Roy did not escape the bite of her sharp tongue. But Mary and Otis went to town with their Uncle Roy, returning with more clothes than they had had for some time.</p>

<p>Myra was too indignant to speak to any of them when they returned home and refused to notice Roy when he took his departure the next day. Poor Mary had to suffer for the trip which she had to town, for Myra made life almost unbearable for her! Until this time she had not resented Otis so much, for although she did not like him, his misfortune called forth all the good that was in her, and she had sympathy for him. Now her rage must be spent, and she gave him part of it. She refused them the privilege of eating at the table with the rest of the family, giving them tin plates from which to eat their food and tin cans from which to drink. Her own children received the best, and then if there was anything left, Otis and Mary could have it if they chose.</p>

<p>The material which Roy bought for Mary was left lying in the dresser drawer for weeks, because Myra refused Mary the privilege of making it, as she always had something else for her to do. But Aunt Millie asked that Mary and Otis might visit her, and when Dan was informed that Mary had not been allowed time to make dresses out of the material Uncle Roy had gotten her, there was another scene in the Dennison home, and Mary began to prepare one dress by cutting into the goods. Myra then denied her the privilege of using the sewing machine, and she stitched her dress with her fingers and a needle, but as she was very neat it looked very well. But when she went to get her dress for the trip, she found it covered with axle grease. It was completely ruined, and she could not wear it at all. There was another scene in the Dennison home, and Mary and Otis went to visit their aunt, although Myra did everything she could to keep them at home. Mary wore the dress that she had made, and when her aunt saw it she exclaimed at the neatness of it but said, &#8220;Why, Mary, dear, why did you not make it with the machine? Your mother has a machine that stitches nicely, and why did you not use it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon being informed as to the reason, she then had Mary to rip the dress apart and stitch it on her machine. But when Mary returned home, after Myra saw what had been done, she ripped the dress apart and Mary had to put it together again, stitching it with a needle.</p>

<p>How unbearable life was becoming, yet Dan never took his place in the home as he should until aroused beyond further endurance, and then there would always be a scene! So Mary kept many things from him for fear of such, for after a scene in the home Myra would usually avenge herself on the children.</p>

<p>But there were some bright spots in her life, for after Roy joined the navy, he never failed to write to his little Peachy girl. There came letters to her from Panama, Cuba, South America, Hawaii, and the Philippines. Many times he would send them some curios from different places and often money, so that Mary no longer had to clothe herself in Myra&#8217;s old dresses. She delighted also in answering Roy&#8217;s letters, but her heart was starving for the love of a tender, sympathetic, understanding parent. Aunt Millie took special interest in her, and their talks together helped Mary to develop into a girl with bright and noble ideals.</p>

<h1>God Forbid That I Should Murmur</h1>

<p class="author">Ethel Meadows</p>

<p class="verse">God forbid that I should murmur
<br />Of the hardness of the way;
<br />Of foolish things that people do,
<br />Of trifling things they say.</p>

<p class="verse">God forbid that I should murmur
<br />When another causes pain;
<br />All that ever fret and try us
<br />Are not reasons to complain.</p>

<p class="verse">They are only tools that shape us
<br />After God&#8217;s most holy plan&#8212;
<br />Oh, such love our God revealeth;
<br />Oh, such mercy unto man!</p>

<p class="verse">God forbid that I should murmur&#8212;
<br />Anything that touches me,
<br />First was suffered by my Savior&#8212;
<br />Suffered, oh, so willingly.</p>

<p class="verse">Little things that fret and try us,
<br />Causing murmur and complaint,
<br />If but borne, as He intended,
<br />Are the makings of a saint.</p>

<p class="verse">His best timbers all are tempered
<br />By the raging of the storm;
<br />And until the tool has chiseled,
<br />The marble has not shape or form.</p>
