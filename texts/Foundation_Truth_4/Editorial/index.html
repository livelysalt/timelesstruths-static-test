<h1>Editorial</h1>

<h2>About <i>Maidens</i></h2>
<p>Maidens of Virtue and Honor, formerly <i>Dear Princess</i> magazine, is a section of the publication, <i>Foundation Truth</i>, which you are now holding. In winter of 1999, <i>Dear Princess</i> changed to the name of Maidens of Virtue and Honor, and merged into a section of <i>Foundation Truth</i>. As before, I, Abigail Spinks, am laboring as editress, although Skye is no longer a co-worker in this role. I am trusting God to accomplish His purpose in this work and greatly appreciate your prayers.</p>

<h2>On Writing and Contributions</h2>
<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;The L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+126%3A3" title="Psalm 126:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 126:3)</span></a></span> Has the Lord done anything for you? We would be so encouraged to hear about it! Whether you have found any helpful tips or hints in learning a skill, or the Lord has been teaching you a lesson, given you help or answered prayer, please feel free to share. In this way you can encourage, challenge, and strengthen others in the right, for we are called to <span class="scripture">&#8220;consider one another to provoke [stir up, spur] unto love and good works.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A24" title="Hebrews 10:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 10:24)</span></a></span></p>

<p>If you are feeling like you have nothing to share, please search your heart and find why. As daughters of the King, our hearts should be full of His praises and lips ready to tell of His goodness. If that is not the case, we should find out what ails us. Don&#8217;t be cheated out of the blessing of sharing what the Lord has done for you or is teaching you! Do not let the devil tell you it is boastful or prideful to write and share what God has taught you&#8212;you are only glorifying the Teacher, which we are commanded to do.</p>

<p>We would greatly appreciate hearing from mothers, grandmothers, older sisters&#8212;we have much to learn from you. Please do write and share what experience in the Narrow Way has taught you (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+2%3A3-5">Titus 2:3-5</a>).</p>

<p>For those of you who have written; thank you all for your letters! They are a great source of encouragement to us. For as <span class="scripture">&#8220;iron sharpeth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+27%3A17" title="Proverbs 27:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 27:17)</span></a></span> Your comments, concerns and suggestions are welcome, so please write in if you have any. Keep in mind that we consider your letters for printing; therefore please state in your letter if you wish it not to be printed or if you prefer to remain anonymous, etc.</p>

<h2>Note</h2>
<p>In the fall of 1999, I found myself in the situation of having the entire ministry of <i>Dear Princess</i> placed upon my shoulder where a short time before two of us found the burden almost more than we could handle. This went on for a time as an issue was expected shortly by our readership, but the actual work was less than complete. Through that time the Lord refined us much and in due time lifted the load through the merging of the old magazine with the new of which you are reading. When this happened the relief was so great on our part and the emotional strings which were torn and buried, now resurfaced and we found ourselves in a battle in which we no longer felt a burden for this publishing work. For several months I have carried on, half numb and not with the burden I knew was necessary, simply because no other was ready to fill the place to serve the young women. The result was this place was not filled, only the name that carried this responsibility was dutifully printed as well as with a few articles that I managed to fill up my allotted pages. I want to apologize for this. For you, as readers, suffered by not receiving the books and back issues you requested or answers to your questions or having very belated orders at the least. I hope I can express how sorry I am that I was not able to meet your needs promptly. Thank you for your patience with me. I appreciate the longsuffering exercised.</p>

<p>And now to the present. I have pleaded with the Lord to bring someone to fill this place, but His answer has been, <span class="scripture">&#8220;My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+12%3A9" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 12:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 12:9)</span></a></span> He has spoken to me that I was not the one to start this ministry, to place myself in this position, and I cannot leave. He has not released me, and I apologize for acting like He had. I covet your prayers as I feel very small before the Lord and request that you pray that I would serve you in the order, direction and fear of the Lord. May God be magnified.</p>

<p class="signature">In the Potter&#8217;s hand,<br />Abigail Spinks, editress</p>

<p>Postscript: Last issue we mentioned praying about a headcovering discussion. As of this issue, we don&#8217;t feel clear in moving ahead on that. We feel the need to pray more about it and focus on other things at this time.</p>
