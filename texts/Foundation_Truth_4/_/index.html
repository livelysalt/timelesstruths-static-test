<h1>Purpose of <i>Foundation Truth</i></h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Folks,</p>

<p>Greetings in the name of Jesus, our Friend and Redeemer, who gave Himself for us, the guiltless for the guilty, that we might be saved.
Without Him, we can do nothing, but by Him, we can do all things He wants us to do (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+4%3A13">Philippians 4:13</a>).
</p>

<p>We are leaning heavily on the Lord to help us in this task. We want to be of assistance to those who desire to live for God and make heaven their home, and we want to work with the Holy Spirit in stirring and awakening all others to the great necessity of doing so.</p>

<p>That is the purpose of this publication. If we can, by God&#8217;s help, be of usefulness to even one soul, then all labor and effort will be more than repaid.</p>

<p>Now we wish to state that we love everyone, even the vast majority of you whom we have not met. How can we say this? With joy, and an inward assurance, I can declare it because
<span class="scripture">&#8220;the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+5%3A5" title="Romans 5:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 5:5)</span></a></span>
There is no one, at all, whom we resent, or to whom we bear a grudge. We do not have it &#8220;in&#8221; for anyone, nor are we offended at anyone.</p>

<p>A brother once remarked to someone he had never met before that he had a past acquaintance with them of a sort. Then he explained that he was acquainted with God, and God was acquainted with them, and so he had a sort of indirect acquaintance with them. It is because God knows you and loves you, dear reader, that we venture to write and hope. He is able to give what is needed.</p>

<p>We are but fellow pilgrims on the narrow way, rejoicing in our freedom and walking in the light that has shone upon our pathway. There are things we are persuaded of (deeply) that accompany salvation (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+6%3A9">Hebrews 6:9</a>), and there are things that we are not certain about. But our trust is in God. He has brought us safely thus far, and we trust Him to lead us safely home.</p>

<p>We could outline a list of what we are convicted of in our heart and a list of questions which occur to our mind. But I am not convinced that it would be profitable for you or for us to do so. Why? In God&#8217;s great plan of guidance and correction, you may not be at the same lesson junctures. It may not make sense at this time, although it may be just what you need at another time. We are asking the Lord to guide us. We are asking Him to hover over the paper as you read it and to assist you in getting hold of what is relevant and profitable, spiritually, to you at the time you read it.</p>

<p>If you feel it is necessary for you to know exactly where we stand on a particular principle, please contact us. Write us or call. But, if you read the paper over an extended period of time, we feel certain you will know, and we trust and hope that it will be of benefit to you.</p>

<p><b>To properly understand the Bible, it is necessary to be under the same Holy Spirit that inspired it to be written.</b> With Brother John, we must be <span class="scripture">&#8220;in the Spirit&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelations+1%3A10" title="Revelations 1:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelations 1:10)</span></a></span> to see and know and understand.
Only the Lord can enlighten the eyes of our understanding (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+1%3A18">Ephesians 1:18</a>),
and give skill and understanding (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Daniel+9%3A22%3B+1%3A17">Daniel 9:22; 1:17</a>).
The Lord will teach us to rightly divide the Word of Truth, producing a workman that needeth not to be ashamed (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A15">II&nbsp;Timothy 2:15</a>).
</p>

<p>Having been taught in this way by this wonderful Teacher for some time, we declare with great joy that we are
<span class="scripture">&#8220;not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+1%3A16" title="Romans 1:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 1:16)</span></a></span>
We would happily shout to all the glorious news: <b>IT WORKS!</b> It does just exactly as promised. Not a single part has failed in any way. Hallelujah! It is gloriously true and accurate. In spite of all who have failed to find, the treasure is yet in the field,
and there are those who have paid the full price to buy the same, and are rejoicing in full possession (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+13%3A44">Matthew 13:44</a>).
</p>

<p>If you have been hindered&#8212;if you are disillusioned&#8212;if you are hurt&#8212;bewildered&#8212;confused&#8212;desperate&#8212;in great need&#8212;we would declare to you the results of our own personal experience with God and His way: <b>IT WORKS!</b> And we would say to you, &#8220;Lift up your head. Look and live. <b>It was designed by God Himself to work in your case.</b>&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;For me the promise sure was made,<br />And sealed on Calvary.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/The_Unchanging_Word/index.html" title="The Unchanging Word">*</a></p>

<p>Finally, we ask an interest in your prayers.
Ye who love the Lord, would you help hold up our hands? (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Exodus+17%3A8-13">Exodus 17:8-13</a>).

<h1>To Receive <i>Foundation Truth</i></h1>

<p>We publish <i>Foundation Truth</i> by faith, its only support being free-will offerings that God lays on the hearts of His children to keep this ministry supplied. Therefore, there is no subscription price.</p>

<p>If the Lord lays on your heart to contribute, please make out any checks or money orders to Richard Erickson or Abigail Spinks. <b>We have difficulty depositing any monies made out to <i>Foundation Truth</i> or any other past or present publication name.</b></p>

<p>Address subscription requests or correspondence to:</p>

<p>All scripture quotations are from the King James Version unless otherwise indicated.</p>

<p>We are in the process of transition; hence, although the portion addressed to young women is a well-defined section of the publication, there is not a section specifically dedicated to young men, older men, or older women. Some columns will be regular, and others occasional. The absence of names on articles is not meant to frustrate, but to keep the focus on the message, rather than the messenger. Please pray for us, that the Lord&#8217;s will be accomplished in both format and content.</p>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">We have not had a continuation of our discussion on predestination and freewill ready for this issue. After prayerful consideration, it seemed profitable to print this letter and our response in our discussion section for this issue.</p>
</div>


<h1>Think Out of the Box</h1>

<p>Being a Christian requires one to think apart from the traditions of men, from what culture teaches, and from what is normally expected of us. Something we all do is to get a fixed idea in our head and refuse to look at the issue in a different way&#8230;&#8203;with humbleness and an objective mind. The adversary uses this stubbornness, this desire to be right and in control, to blind us to the spiritual truths of God. As Christians we need to realize that we don&#8217;t have it all figured out. Our walk with God is to be constantly growing and deepening. Therefore things we thought we understood as a baby Christian will seem like a puddle of water in comparison to a deep well, when we are much more mature in Christ. We are aliens, strangers and pilgrims walking on the narrow road of Christ. We need to &#8220;think out of the box&#8221; and live differently from the world.</p>

<p>Having said that, I would like to discuss the seventh day Sabbath. This is <i>not</i> an issue of salvation nor of denominational ties (my family claims no denomination&#8212;we are simply Christians). I do believe this is an important Bible teaching, as God&#8217;s word is <b>consistent and logical</b>. Please study this with me and check all verse references for yourself. The Bible is our absolute authority and I will be quoting from the KJV. I apologize for this being so lengthy; I&#8217;m trying to be thorough. Please bear with me.</p>

<p>God established the Sabbath in the beginning after He had finished His creation:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it He had rested from all His work which God created and made.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+2%3A1-3" title="Genesis 2:1-3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 2:1-3)</span></a></span>
The Lord blessed this particular day and sanctified it&#8212;which is &#8220;to set apart as holy.&#8221; The next reference to the Sabbath is in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Exodus+16%3A22-30">Exodus 16:22-30</a>. When God brought His people out of Egypt, He gave them manna to eat each day. But on the sixth day, they were to gather twice as much because the next day was <span class="scripture">&#8220;the rest of the holy sabbath unto the Lord.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Exodus+16%3A22-23" title="Exodus 16:22-23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Exodus 16:22-23)</span></a></span>  Both of these references occur <i>before</i> God gave the ten commandments, which included the Sabbath as one of His eternal, moral laws (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+111%3A7-8%3B+Isaiah+40%3A8%3B+Matthew+5%3A17-18%3B+1+Peter+1%3A25%3B+Acts+7%3A38">Psalm 111:7-8; Isaiah 40:8; Matthew 5:17-18; I&nbsp;Peter 1:25; Acts 7:38</a>).</p>

<p>Now we come to <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Exodus+20">Exodus 20</a> and the giving of the ten commandments. The fourth commandment reads: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Exodus+20%3A8-11" title="Exodus 20:8-11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Exodus 20:8-11)</span></a></span>  The Sabbath, <b>which is a memorial of God&#8217;s creation</b>, is now also a part of the commandments. In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+5">Deuteronomy 5</a>, Moses is reviewing the commandments to the Israelites. When he comes to the Sabbath command he gives the people an additional reason to observe it: as a remembrance of God&#8217;s deliverance from Egypt.</p>

<p>I have heard one commentator say that the Sabbath was a sign between God and the Jews to distinguish them from the heathen. <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+20%3A20">Ezekiel 20:20</a> seems to confirm this: <span class="scripture">&#8220;And hallow My sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God.&#8221;</span> Are <i>we</i> not also to be distinguished from the heathen? We, too, are called to be pilgrims and strangers (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+2%3A11">I&nbsp;Peter 2:11</a>). According to <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+3%3A28-29">Galatians 3:28-29</a>, <span class="scripture">&#8220;There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christ&#8217;s, then are ye Abraham&#8217;s seed, and heirs according to the promise.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>God&#8217;s people <i>are</i> to be different from the world. We are sanctified by the blood of Jesus (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+13%3A12">Hebrews 13:12</a>), and by God&#8217;s word, <span class="scripture">&#8220;They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. <b>Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.</b>&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+17%3A16-17" title="John 17:16-17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 17:16-17)</span></a></span> The psalmist also realized the importance of the commandments and took great delight in them (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalms+19%3A7-11%3B+40%3A8%3B+78%3A7%3B+119%3A33%3B+66%3B+89%3B+127%3B+131%3B+143">Psalms 19:7-11; 40:8; 78:7; 119:33; 66; 89; 127; 131; 143</a>).</p>

<p>Now what does the New Testament say? It is true that the fourth commandment is not restated in the New Testament. However, it is by example. Also, there is nothing that states it is to be changed. Since Jesus is <i>the</i> example, shouldn&#8217;t we walk as He walked? <span class="scripture">&#8220;He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+2%3A6" title="I&nbsp;John 2:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 2:6)</span></a></span> Jesus shows His support for the Sabbath and the right way to observe it by asking
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+3%3A4" title="Mark 3:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 3:4)</span></a></span> And in the gospel of Luke it says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, <b>as his custom was</b>, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+4%3A16" title="Luke 4:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 4:16)</span></a></span>  (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+1%3A21%3B+6%3A2">Mark 1:21; 6:2</a>). And later in Luke it says: <span class="scripture">&#8220;But he passing through the midst of them went his way, And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+4%3A30-31" title="Luke 4:30-31"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 4:30-31)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Some say that Jesus came to change the Sabbath, but He made this positive statement: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, <b>Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</b>&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+5%3A17-18" title="Matthew 5:17-18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 5:17-18)</span></a></span> Jesus kept the moral law&#8212;the ten commandments&#8212;perfectly, as no human could. He fulfilled the ceremonial laws because He became what all the types and symbols pointed to. And He fulfilled the judicial law by being a living example of God&#8217;s perfect justice. <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+5%3A18">Verse 18</a> stated <span class="scripture">&#8220;Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.&#8221;</span> <b>This emphasizes the inspiration and enduring authority of the Old Testament</b> (which is all they had at the time). It also suggests that the New Testament should not be seen as a replacement or making void the Old Testament. This also supports what the psalmist said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;All his commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+111%3A7-8" title="Psalm 111:7-8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 111:7-8)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Jesus also spoke of the Sabbath in a future event,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+24%3A20" title="Matthew 24:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 24:20)</span></a></span>
Some say this pointed to the destruction of Jerusalem in A. D. 70 (40 years <i>after</i> the crucifixion of Jesus.) Some say it points to the tribulation. Either way, He was still referring to the Sabbath in future events.</p>

<p>Jesus kept the commandments in life (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+15%3A10">John 15:10</a>), and stated that <b>if we loved Him, we, too, would keep them</b> (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+14%3A15%2C21">John 14:15,21</a>). We keep them out of love because God writes His laws in our hearts (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+31%3A33%3B+Hebrews+8%3A10%3B+10%3A16">Jeremiah 31:33; Hebrews 8:10; 10:16</a>). This is not legalism; it is obedience as a result of salvation (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+2%3A13%3B+1+Corinthians+7%3A19%3B+James+1%3A22-25%3B+1+John+2%3A4%2C+7%3B+3%3A24%3B+5%3A3%3B+2+John+6">Romans 2:13; I&nbsp;Corinthians 7:19; James 1:22-25; I&nbsp;John 2:4, 7; 3:24; 5:3; II&nbsp;John 6</a>). Jesus even kept the Sabbath in death (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+23">Luke 23</a>). He was crucified on Friday (the preparation day for the Sabbath [<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+23%3A54">Luke 23:54</a>]), and remained in the tomb through the Sabbath until the first day, Sunday; meanwhile the followers of Jesus also rested on the Sabbath (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+23%3A56%3B+ark+15%3A42%3B+16%3A1-2">Luke 23:56; ark 15:42; 16:1-2</a>).</p>

<p>When moving into the book of Acts, there are several references of the apostles keeping the Sabbath:
<span class="scripture">&#8220;And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+13%3A44" title="Acts 13:44"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 13:44)</span></a></span>  (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+13%3A14%2C+42%3B+17%3A2-3%3B+18%3A4">Acts 13:14, 42; 17:2-3; 18:4</a>). Then in Romans we find verses that show the importance of the law. Paul discusses grace through faith and the role the law plays. He says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have <b>obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine</b> which was delivered you&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+6%3A15-17" title="Romans 6:15-17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 6:15-17)</span></a></span>  (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+3%3A31%3B+7%3A12%3B+8%3A1-4">Romans 3:31; 7:12; 8:1-4</a>).</p>

<p>Now we&#8217;ll look at the reasons for Sunday worship. The resurrection occurred on the first day of the week. While this is a very meaningful and important day to the Christian, it certainly does not give us the liberty to change God&#8217;s law. Then in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+16%3A2">I&nbsp;Corinthians 16:2</a> it says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.&#8221;</span> Paul is simply telling the Corinthians to set aside their offering on this day so no collections would be made when he arrived. <i>That&#8217;s it.</i> Can more be read into this verse? A confusing passage in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+20">Acts 20</a> is <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+20%3A7">vs. 7</a>. It states: <span class="scripture">&#8220;And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.&#8221;</span> At the time of creation God established a day as going from sunset to sunset; this is what the Jews went by. So after sunset on Saturday (Sabbath), it was considered the first day (Sunday) of the week. It&#8217;s obvious, from <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+20%3A7-12">vs. 7-12</a>, that this was when the disciples met. It&#8217;s quite likely that they gathered because Paul was leaving the next morning (Sunday). Paul seemed to place no special significance on this day&#8212;if it was indeed the new day to worship on. Some say that the &#8220;breaking of bread&#8221; referred to here was communion or the Lord&#8217;s supper. If it was, that&#8217;s fine&#8212;there is no certain time stated in the Bible for when this is to be celebrated. It seems that Paul immediately began speaking until at least midnight. After he brought Eutychus back to life, they ate. By that time they must have been very hungry and in need of a break. <i>Too much</i> is being read into this passage to assume that a new worship day is being observed and that they could only be celebrating the Lord&#8217;s Supper (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+27%3A35-36%3B+Matthew+15%3A36%3B+Mark+8%3A6%3B+John+6%3A11">Acts 27:35-36; Matthew 15:36; Mark 8:6; John 6:11</a>).</p>

<p>Another point of interest is in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+20%3A19">John 20:19</a>, on the day Jesus rose from the dead (Sunday), the disciples were <span class="scripture">&#8220;assembled for fear of the Jews.&#8221;</span> It seems quite natural for them to be together, given all that had happened. Later, in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+20%3A26">vs. 26</a>, they were together again. However, <b>it was eight days later, which makes it a Monday.</b></p>

<p>Because of the above reasons the assumption has been made that the first day of the week is the &#8220;Lord&#8217;s Day&#8221; as referred to in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+1%3A10">Revelation 1:10</a>. However, in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+12%3A8">Matthew 12:8</a> it says: <span class="scripture">&#8220;For the Son of man is <b>Lord even of the sabbath day</b>&#8221;</span>  (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+2%3A28%3B+Luke+6%3A5">Mark 2:28; Luke 6:5</a>). Since Jesus declares that He is Lord of the Sabbath, it&#8217;s logical that the Sabbath is truly the &#8220;Lord&#8217;s Day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another questionable verse is <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+2%3A15">Ephesians 2:15</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Having abolished in His flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments <b>contained in ordinances</b>; for to make in Himself of twain one new man, so making peace.&#8221;</span> Jesus, through His death, abolished the Old Testament ceremonial laws, feasts, and sacrifices. These pointed to Him, and He is the fulfillment. Next we&#8217;ll look at <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+14%3A5-6">Romans 14:5-6</a>: <span class="scripture">&#8220;One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. He that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the Lord.&#8221;</span> A gentile convert may still have been influenced by special days of festivities connected with his former pagan worship and a Jewish convert may still have felt bound by the Old Testament ceremonial feasts. Some also go as far as to say that <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+15%3A28-29">Acts 15:28-29</a> are the only things necessary to obey. But if you check carefully, this was directed to new Christians. This was like milk for the baby&#8212;they were too immature to handle the solid food of the whole word. In other words, the process of obedience out of love, is a gradual process. We start small and slowly expand. Again, the Sabbath is not mentioned here. It is presumptuous of man to think he can usurp the 4th commandment.</p>

<p>In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+2%3A14%2C16-17">Colossians 2:14,16-17</a> it says: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to His cross. Let no man therefore judge you in&#8230;&#8203;respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: which are a shadow of things to come&#8230;.&#8221;</span> The word <i>handwriting</i> in vs. 14 comes from the Greek expression meaning &#8220;bond of indebtedness.&#8221; All people owe God an unpayable debt for violating His law and are under the sentence of death. But through Jesus&#8217; death on the cross, this certificate of debt has been erased&#8212;nailed to the cross&#8212;forgiven. Now what does vs. 16-17 mean by saying <span class="scripture">&#8220;holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: which are a shadow of things to come&#8221;</span>? See explanation given for <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+2%3A15">Ephesians 2:15</a>&#8212;these were the &#8220;shadow&#8221; pointing to Christ. But what about &#8220;the sabbath days&#8221;? The seventh day Sabbath in the ten commandment law is not a shadow of something, rather it is a memorial of something that has already occurred&#8212;Creation. It makes sense that &#8220;sabbath days&#8221; in v. 16 refers to <b>ceremonial sabbaths</b>. The Jews had seven feasts they celebrated each year (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Leviticus+23">Leviticus 23</a>), such as Passover and the Feast of Tabernacles. These feasts themselves were considered a sabbath of rest. They fell on various days and were observed in <i>addition</i> to the seventh day Sabbath.</p>

<p>A commentator I often hear makes this quote: &#8220;Jesus is the substance that fulfills the Sabbath.&#8221; If you look in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+3%3A7-19%3B+4%3A1-11">Hebrews 3:7-19; 4:1-11</a>, the writer is warning the readers to not be like the Israelites when God brought them out of Egypt. They saw God&#8217;s works for 40 years and still persisted in their unbelief. So almost all of that generation perished in the wilderness because God did not allow them to enter Canaan&#8212;the promised land&#8212;God&#8217;s rest. We&#8217;re to look at this example and fear, for if we do not believe, we, too, will not enter into God&#8217;s rest&#8212;His salvation. <span class="scripture">&#8220;<b>There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God,</b>&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A9" title="Hebrews 4:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 4:9)</span></a></span> or it can be said, &#8220;<b>a keeping of a sabbath to the people of God.</b>&#8221; The word <i>rest</i> in that verse is translated in the Greek, &#8220;<b>sabbath rest</b>&#8221;. The seventh day Sabbath symbolizes the rest God took after He made creation (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A10">Hebrews 4:10</a>). <b>This whole passage speaks of the rest we enter into as believers and concludes with the Sabbath as a weekly reminder or memorial of it.</b></p>

<p>Should we not follow the clear teaching of God&#8217;s Word? Should we not <span class="scripture">&#8220;obey God rather than men&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+5%3A29" title="Acts 5:29"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 5:29)</span></a></span>? Jesus warned against this sort of thing: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do. And He said unto them, <b>Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.</b>&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+7%3A7-9" title="Mark 7:7-9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 7:7-9)</span></a></span> Please prayerfully consider these things.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s now important to see where Sunday worship really did come from. Study of historical sources from the first to the fifth centuries reveal the transfer of Sabbath to Sunday was a gradual process. After the fall of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, and the Jewish revolt against the Romans in A.D. 135, the Jews were scattered and their religion was strongly opposed. Sun worship was quite common in pagan religions. To distance themselves from Judaism, as well as make Christianity more acceptable to Rome, early Christian leaders saw that Jesus&#8217; resurrection on the 1st day might bridge the gap. Both Sabbath and Sunday were observed during this process.</p>

<p>Sixtus, the Bishop of the Christian church in Rome began the process that led to the transfer of worship days. At first, Sunday worship to celebrate the resurrection was held yearly. Then in A.D. 200 Pope Victor tried to enforce this yearly observance by ordering all bishops to be excommunicated if they did not follow this plan. The first law <i>commanding</i> Sunday rest was issued by the Christian Roman Emperor, Constantine, on March 7, 321 A.D. Then in A.D. 386, Theodosius I forbid litigation or payment of either public or private debt on Sunday. Theodosius II, in A.D. 425, forbid all amusements, circuses and theatre on Sunday, and in 538 A. D., the 3rd Synod of Orleans forbid all work in rural areas on Sunday.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic Church sees the change of the Sabbath as a sign of power, and Catholic church authorities make the following quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">In response to the question, &#8220;Have you any other way of proving that the church has power to institute festivals of precept?&#8221; Stephen Keenan wrote, &#8220;Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her&#8212;she could not have substituted the observance of Sunday the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday the seventh day, a change for which there is no scriptural authority.&#8221;</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[<i>A Doctrinal Catechism</i>, pp. 174]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p class="first">Father Enright, a Roman Catholic priest, was reported in the American Sentinel, New York, as saying, &#8220;The Bible says, &#8216;Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day.&#8217; The Catholic church says, &#8216;No! By my divine power I have abolished the Sabbath day and command you to keep holy the first day of the week. And now the entire civilized world bows down in reverent obedience to the command of the Holy Catholic Church.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The early Christians had first adopted the Jewish seven-day week with its numbered weekdays, but by the close of the 3rd century the planetary week and in the 4th and 5th centuries the pagan calendar names had become general in western Christendom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two quotes from Martin Luther:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">&#8220;The Catholics allege the Sabbath changed into Sunday, the Lord&#8217;s day, contrary to the decalogue, as it appears. Neither is there any example more boasted of than the changing of the Sabbath day. Great, say they, is the power and authority of the church, since it dispensed with one of the Ten Commands.&#8221;</p>

<p>We obey because we understand our Lord&#8217;s commandments and do whatever He asks to His glory. The commandments continue to operate. The idea that they are canceled does injustice to the integrity of the word of God, and the guidance of God, in whom there is no shadow of doubt or change.</p>

<h1>Response to: Think Out of the Box</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Mrs. Stace,</p>

<p>Greetings in the name of Jesus, the Joy of man&#8217;s desiring, the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End. How thankful we are to be saved and walking with God!</p>

<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to write. I appreciate the detailed letter of your understanding and convictions about the Sabbath. I deeply appreciate your desire to live right and your carefulness to divide rightly the Word of God.</p>

<p>As far as understanding the Sabbath to be the seventh day of the week and correctly identifying the incorrect characterization of Sunday as the Sabbath, we are both in total agreement.</p>

<p>I do not know, however, if you have given a great deal of thought to <b>the profound differences between the Old Testament salvation experience and the New Testament salvation experience.</b> In carefully reading your letter to us for your understanding of the overall differences between the Old Testament and the New Testament, I find you expressing yourself in these quotes:</p>

<blockquote><p class="first">Jesus kept the moral law&#8212;the ten commandments&#8212;perfectly, as no human could. He fulfilled the ceremonial laws because He became what all the types and symbols pointed to.</p>
</blockquote>


<blockquote><p class="first">Jesus, through His death, abolished the Old Testament ceremonial laws, feasts, and sacrifices. These pointed to Him, and He is the fulfillment.</p>
</blockquote>


<blockquote><p class="first">A gentile convert may still have been influenced by special days of festivities connected with his former pagan worship and a Jewish convert may still have felt bound by the Old Testament ceremonial feasts.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>From these quotations, I have the impression that you feel that the Old Testament ceremonial laws, feasts, and sacrifices constitute the abolished part of the Mosaic Law system, while other parts of that Mosaic Law system were not abolished. (Since the Old Testament covers more than the Mosaic Law system, involving human history before the covenant with Abraham and during that covenant, I will refer to Mosaic Law&#8212;or the law according to Moses&#8212;specifically. The Abraham covenant also finds a spiritual fulfillment in the New Testament.)</p>

<p>The key to understanding correctly the entire matter is involved in <b>why the Mosaic Law system was abolished at all.</b> The writer of Hebrews plainly explains the matter in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+8%3A5-13">Hebrews 8:5-13</a>. Let us examine this passage of scripture carefully.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+8%3A5" title="Hebrews 8:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 8:5)</span></a></span></p>

<p>We note that the writer is speaking of a covenant <span class="scripture">&#8220;<b>showed to thee in the mount.</b>&#8221;</span> In the seventh verse, he calls it <b>the first covenant.</b></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+8%3A6" title="Hebrews 8:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 8:6)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Here the writer refers to <b>a better covenant, established upon better promises.</b> This better covenant obviously came after the first covenant.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+8%3A7" title="Hebrews 8:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 8:7)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Here the writer plainly tells us that the first covenant, the one showed to thee in the mount, was faulty, therefore a second covenant was sought.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when <b>I will make a new covenant</b> with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah: <b>Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers</b> in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+8%3A8-9" title="Hebrews 8:8-9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 8:8-9)</span></a></span></p>

<p>This is very plain. The new covenant will be very different from the old covenant.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;For <b>this is the covenant that I will make</b> with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; <b>I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts</b>: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people: And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest. For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+8%3A10-12" title="Hebrews 8:10-12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 8:10-12)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Now, the nature of the fault is identified. What was it that God found inadequate in the first covenant? The tenth verse informs us. The second covenant would <span class="scripture">&#8220;put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts.&#8221;</span> As David discovered, in his remorse for his transgression, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Behold, <b>thou desirest truth in the inward parts</b>: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+51%3A6" title="Psalm 51:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 51:6)</span></a></span> You will note that David lived under the Mosaic Law, and he did not have the law of God written into his heart in such a way as to keep him from sin. He realized that he would not have failed God in the way that he did if he could have had this kind of experience. But God was not satisfied to simply write His law in commandments in tablets of stone for men to strive to live to; He promised to make a new covenant where His law could be written by His handiwork in the living, fleshly tablets of the hearts of men. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+3%3A3" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 3:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 3:3)</span></a></span> The enormous and profound difference between salvation under the law and salvation under the grace and truth that came by Jesus Christ is given to us in these scriptures. It is the difference between trying to live right with wrong inside of us versus living right with right inside of us. It is the difference between defeat and victory, between failing and overcoming.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old.

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;&#8230;&#8203;To finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Daniel+9%3A24" title="Daniel 9:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Daniel 9:24)</span></a></span>
The writer of Hebrews wrote during the transition time between the old covenant and the new. A time when men were beginning to grasp by faith what had been made available to them in the gospel&#8212;even the revolutionary change of the heart in the hidden depths, thus producing a holy life in which the sinning had ended and everlasting righteousness begun. So that they could be numbered among those ninety-nine just persons who needed no repentance (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+15%3A7">Luke 15:7</a>). That they could be like Jesus in heart (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+4%3A17%3B+1+John+3%3A3%2C6-10">I&nbsp;John 4:17; I&nbsp;John 3:3,6-10</a>). All those of the old covenant could not receive this promise, for it was not ready in their time, but <span class="scripture">&#8220;God, having provided some better thing for us&#8230;.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+11%3A40" title="Hebrews 11:40"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 11:40)</span></a></span>  (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+10%3A23-24">Luke 10:23-24</a>). The bottom line of this change in covenants is that God made man holy; He requires him to live holy, and He was not satisfied with an interim covenant which did not make man holy as God required him to be. The first covenant was the best that could be given at the time to serve as a schoolmaster to bring men to Christ, and it restrained sin to an extent by bringing knowledge to man of God&#8217;s holiness and hatred of sin. But it was not good enough for what God really wanted&#8212;the heart changed to a holy heart, so that the issues of the life would be holy. Therefore he found fault with the first and taketh it away that he may establish the second.</p>

<p>It should be evident that a change of this magnitude in the heart of the one upon whom the work is wrought would be a twenty-four-a-day, seven-day-a-week salvation. For out of the heart are the issues of life, and as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he. A holy heart will produce a holy life.</p>

<p>But the Bible deals with the reality of two different kinds of sin in the individual. Sins which are acquired by transgression, which bring spiritual death (separation) between the soul and God, and sins which are not the responsibility of the individual, but are inherited from our forefathers, Adam and Eve. The impurity of inherited depravity (for we all <span class="scripture">&#8220;were <i>by nature</i> the children of wrath&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+2%3A3" title="Ephesians 2:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 2:3)</span></a></span>) causes us to go astray from the very time of our conception, although we are not accountable for those wrong things during the early part of our life, as we are innocent and unaware. Therefore, those wrong motives and actions are not imputed at that time. As Paul states, <span class="scripture">&#8220;For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+7%3A9" title="Romans 7:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 7:9)</span></a></span> He died because he realized that he was wrong, and with that knowledge came condemnation. Furthermore, he could not stop the transgressing, for he had not the power to stop. The Adam image within him had prompted him to do what he began to realize was wrong; but the realization brought no power or strength to help him to live to what he knew, so <span class="scripture">&#8220;that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+7%3A15" title="Romans 7:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 7:15)</span></a></span> In all this, he was speaking of his experience <b>under the law</b>, for he states, <span class="scripture">&#8220;for I speak to them that know the law.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+7%3A1" title="Romans 7:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 7:1)</span></a></span> Furthermore, he speaks of his deliverance from the law in these terms, <span class="scripture">&#8220;But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in <b>newness of spirit</b>, and not in the oldness of the letter.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+7%3A6" title="Romans 7:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 7:6)</span></a></span> Please note that this is in complete accord with the removal of the first covenant&#8212;that which was <span class="scripture">&#8220;shewed to thee [Moses] in the mount&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+8%3A5" title="Hebrews 8:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 8:5)</span></a></span>&#8212;that the better covenant, established upon better promises, might be obtained.

<p>The atonement of Christ has the power to purge our hearts of all acquired sin and transgression, <b>and the power to purge the inherited sin nature from our heart.</b> The entire New Testament covenant promises first an experience so profound in its forgiveness and change of heart that it is compared to being born all over again.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God&#8230;. He cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+3%3A3%2C5" title="John 3:3,5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 3:3,5)</span></a></span> But the New Testament covenant promises an experience beyond this in the heart.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, <b>let us go on unto perfection</b>; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+6%3A1" title="Hebrews 6:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 6:1)</span></a></span>
This is in the infilling of the Holy Spirit and the further purifying of the heart. It is the purging spoken of in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+15%3A2">John 15:2</a>, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Every branch that beareth fruit, he <i>purgeth</i> it, that it may bring forth more fruit.&#8221;</span> It is an experience for those who are in the vine.

That prayer was answered at the day of Pentecost when they received the Holy Ghost. Brother Peter&#8217;s testimony: <span class="scripture">&#8220;And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us; and put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+15%3A89" title="Acts 15:89"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 15:89)</span></a></span> The new covenant offers two distinct experiences to take care of two kinds of needs. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+19%3A2" title="Acts 19:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 19:2)</span></a></span></p>

<p>This subsequent work to regeneration is entered into through inspired consecration and faith. The Holy Spirit brings a depth of death to self, a ceasing of our own works, and a hallowed consecration for service to God that is all inclusive, thorough, and complete. The Holy Spirit <i>brings</i> us to this&#8212;it is far beyond the capacity of man to enter into this rest on his own. We can resist and limit God&#8212;and miss the blessing and lose what we have. Or we can allow the Holy Spirit to have His way and take us from the wilderness into this spiritual land of Canaan.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For this is the will of God, even your sanctification.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+4%3A3" title="I&nbsp;Thessalonians 4:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Thessalonians 4:3)</span></a></span>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before, This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin. Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A14-20" title="Hebrews 10:14-20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 10:14-20)</span></a></span> Here, the second work of grace in the new covenant is compared to entering the Holiest room of the Old Testament tabernacle. The first room, the Holy, would represent the regenerated experience of heart; the second room, the Holiest, here represents the perfecting experience.</p>

<p>The brethren of the New Testament, receiving and witnessing to the superiority of the new covenant in their hearts, were full of exhortations to be reconciled to God, then to go on to perfection. This is their burden in the fourth chapter of Hebrews; <span class="scripture">&#8220;<b>There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.</b>&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A9" title="Hebrews 4:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 4:9)</span></a></span> The nature of that Sabbath, or rest, in the new covenant is not a literal day. This is plain in the context of the scripture quoted, for the certain day spoken of was not a Saturday. The first day of rest mentioned here is the rest that the Israelites would find in conquering and inhabiting the land of Canaan (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A7">Hebrews 4:7</a>). They did not find this rest at the day spoken of because they doubted that God would give them the victory to take the land. Therefore, they entered not in because of unbelief. In a type and shadow sense, they were delivered from bondage at the Red Sea, wandered in the wilderness, and were promised rest in the land of promise (Canaan). But they did not enter into this rest because of their unbelief. If they had entered in (as their descendants did after forty years), then they would have entered into rest of the people of God in the old covenant. This would have been their Sabbath continually all the time, and it would have been like God&#8217;s Sabbath. God is still resting from all His work of creation. He started resting on the seventh day, and <b>He is still resting</b>. The work of creation was <i>finished</i> on the end of the sixth day. Nor does He rest every seventh day since from other of His labors. If the Israelites had entered the land of rest (Canaan) and kept the law of God, He would have given them rest about and kept them from their enemies. They would have kept resting as God did from the work of creation. But they did not. However, in the new covenant, <span class="scripture">&#8220;There remaineth&#8230;&#8203;a rest to the people of God.&#8221;</span> It is our privilege to enter into this rest of the soul, ceasing from our own works forever and working the works of God instead, forever and ever. Down here in this old world and right on into eternity. Ever to be with the Lord, resting from our own works, and busy with His. How superior is the rest of the new covenant to the rest of the old covenant!</p>

<p>The old Sabbath day was limited to a single day out of the week, and was a rest from physical labor and activity. It could be observed whether your heart was right with God or not, for it was outward and mental. It was not the rest of the soul. But the new rest can only be kept by the pure in heart, those who are all together the Lord&#8217;s. Do you doubt there is such an experience?
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A11" title="Hebrews 4:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 4:11)</span></a></span>
To assist us in entering into that rest, <span class="scripture">&#8220;the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A12" title="Hebrews 4:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 4:12)</span></a></span> Furthermore, we have a great High Priest, He who helps us to hold fast our profession, who will also help us to <span class="scripture">&#8220;come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A16" title="Hebrews 4:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 4:16)</span></a></span> It is through these great Administrators of the new covenant that we may find this experience that we may please God and do the works of God.</p>

<p>Let us now consider the holiness of the Mosaic Law Sabbath. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Exodus+20%3A8" title="Exodus 20:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Exodus 20:8)</span></a></span> Mankind at that time could not live holy from the heart because provision had not been made to regenerate the heart. Forgiveness was a legal justification; legally absolving the soul of guilt before God, but not imparting the power to live a holy life. All such promise, at that time (the time of the Mosaic Law) was in the future, awaiting the coming of the Messiah. The reality of a holy life, proceeding from a holy heart, kept by the power of God, was foreshadowed by the physical rest from one&#8217;s own labors on one day out of seven, the Sabbath. In the New Testament sense, no one lived holy <b>any day at all</b>. They sinned every day, including the Sabbath. <b>They did not keep the Sabbath holy in the New Testament sense at all; in fact, they could not.</b> The Old Testament sense in which they did keep the Sabbath day holy was in resting from their manual labor. Now it is certainly not sinful to work; indeed, idleness is condemned in the scriptures (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Thessalonians+3%3A10">II&nbsp;Thessalonians 3:10</a>). And it is blessed to be able to rest each night of each day from labor, and this is needful for us while we are in the body, but it is not holiness in the sense of freedom from sin at all. It is temporary freedom from physical labor and blessed to those who labor.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The sleep of a labouring man is sweet.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ecclesiastes+5%3A12" title="Ecclesiastes 5:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ecclesiastes 5:12)</span></a></span>
In requiring the Israelites to cease from their labor on the seventh day (the day of completeness), the Lord was pointing to the perfect rest of soul (not of body) to be made available in the New Testament.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+11%3A28" title="Matthew 11:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 11:28)</span></a></span>
Notice that this rest is every day, twenty-four hours, and seven days a week. The rest (Sabbath) of the soul. &#8220;Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you My Sabbath; ye shall find a Sabbath unto your souls.&#8221; To the humble Israelite, laboring throughout the week and resting on the Sabbath, repenting and sacrificing, obtaining forgiveness and falling into sin again and again, the lesson began to emerge: this rest on one day of the week must mean that God has a perfect (seventh) rest for my soul from this failing. Someday, God will do something that will make it possible for men to perfectly enter into rest from taking his own way, from getting out from under the hand of God. The Lord has better for us than this. Yea, ye shall find the Sabbath (rest) unto your souls.</p>

<p>Living before the great throne seven days a week, we have liberty to meet together and worship at any suitable time or place. We are not bound to a certain place or a certain day, but meet anywhere at any time and worship in spirit and truth.

Then these Mosaic Law keepers could live holy every day, as did those who thus testified to them.</p>

<p><a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+12%3A8">Matthew 12:8</a> is quoted to indicate that Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath day. Yes, He is Lord of the Sabbath, of Sunday, of Monday, of Tuesday, of Wednesday, of Thursday, and of Friday. He is Lord of all. The light and the darkness are alike to Him. It does not bother Him that some Saturdays are short and some long as the seasons change. It does not bother Him that an attempt to keep this particular day (or another) would have people on different sides of this planet worshiping at different times, even different days. He set up the particular remembrance of the Sabbath to the Israelite nation for a specific purpose (to point to Christ and the rest of the soul), and at the time He set this up, it did not matter to the Israelite nation that different parts of the world knew day and night at different times. It was&#8212;<i>for them</i>&#8212;a schoolmaster to bring them to Christ.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+3%3A25" title="Galatians 3:25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 3:25)</span></a></span> We have found the blessed reality, the eternal Sabbath of the soul.</p>

<h1>Abounding Grace</h1>

<p class="author">Charles E. Orr</p>

<p>Wide open is the way to heaven&#8217;s throne of grace. Every needy soul on earth can have access to that throne by day or by night. The gate is never closed. Come boldly, therefore, to that throne. There you will find grace to strengthen and to help you in every needy hour. Grace will sweeten every affliction. O weary one, do you believe it? Is it really so to you? It may be so. It will lighten every burden of your life; it will cast a beautiful light along your pathway and tinge every shadow with a mellow radiance, as the golden sunset gilds the fleecy cloud.</p>

<p>Lay hold, O weary one, upon the throne of grace by faith and be transported into an atmosphere of light and love, of peace and hope. Rich particles of glory can be drawn down to your soul that will lighten up your pathway and enable you to be blessedly contented in every circumstance of life, patient in every affliction, and faithful to perform every duty; that will put a modesty and meeknees into your every action, a cheerfulness into your countenance, a reverence and devotion into your spirit, a sweetness into every expression, and throw about you such an attractive luster, as will make you a blessing everywhere you go. Bow humbly and dependently before the throne of grace; there in earnest, fervent prayer bring down strength and blessings that will elevate your soul and make you more a creature of heaven than of earth. Grace ennobles the character and puts into the being a spiritual tone that allies you more to angels than to unregenerate men.</p>

<p>At the throne of grace you can wave the palm of victory; there you can sway over sin, sickness, Satan, and the world a conqueror&#8217;s scepter; there you can sing the song of triumph in the sweetest melody; there you can trample every foe beneath your feet; there you can defeat every lust of the flesh that wars against the soul; there you can be crowned a prince and king; there you can turn your back upon every dark picture and see only the bright side of things; there you can look by faith down your journey of life and see green fields, shady nooks, rippling streams, blooming flowers, and bright sunny days; there by faith you can see Jesus at the right hand of God and your eternal mansion of glory. This is not the flight of imagination, nor the excitement of sentimentalism; it is blessedly real. Come boldly to the throne of grace.</p>

<h1>More Valuable than Life: The Constitution of Marriage</h1>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money. And Naboth said to Ahab, The Lord forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Kings+21%3A1-3" title="I&nbsp;Kings 21:1-3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Kings 21:1-3)</span></a></span> This inheritance was the fulfillment of the promise of God to the forefathers of Naboth, and he valued it accordingly.</p>

<p>Man is so constituted that he needs something greater and bigger than himself upon which to build his life.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;O Lord, I know that the way of man is <b>not in himself</b>: it is <b>not in man</b> that walketh to direct his steps.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+10%3A23" title="Jeremiah 10:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jeremiah 10:23)</span></a></span> Man was so created to need something outside of himself, something higher, finer, nobler than his own natural qualities and gifts. He was made to be a partaker of the Divine nature, to receive and accept the wisdom of God (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+1%3A4">II&nbsp;Peter 1:4</a>). Man was created to walk with God. What a wonderful vocation! What a precious privilege!</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+4%3A1" title="Ephesians 4:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 4:1)</span></a></span> When Naboth said to Ahab, <span class="scripture">&#8220;The Lord forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee,&#8221;</span> he was walking worthy of this high calling. He put the value of the inheritance of his fathers above his safety. That vineyard meant more to him than a valuable piece of real estate. More than an income. More than any expediency. Ahab, who offered him money, or a better vineyard, did not understand Naboth. Ahab felt he was being generous. Ahab lived for the things of time and place, and he was greatly tried at what he perceived to be Naboth&#8217;s stubbornness. It irritated him that Naboth did not value his offer. Ahab was of the earth, earthly; while Naboth had built his life on things from above, the heavenly.</p>

<p>God instituted marriage, family government, and the care and nurture of children. It is not an arrangement of man&#8217;s choosing. <span class="scripture">&#8220;So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+1%3A27-28" title="Genesis 1:27-28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 1:27-28)</span></a></span>; <span class="scripture">&#8220;Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psa.+127%3A3" title="Psa. 127:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psa. 127:3)</span></a></span></p>

<p>The entire concept is higher than man. It is our vineyard, instituted of God, and He has designed it to yield happiness and fulfillment to those who take hold of his covenant. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And God blessed them.&#8221;</span> When a man or a woman dedicate themselves to marriage, they are dedicating themselves to something higher than just their feelings or desires. They are putting those feelings and desires into a framework of Divine design. Because marriage is of God, it has vast potential for good. This potential is there even when the ties and bonds of marriage are abused and twisted by men.</p>

<p>The understanding that the concept of marriage is higher than the desires of the individual is the key to comprehending our times and the exceeding sinfulness of sin that is all around us. <span class="scripture">&#8220;For the land is full of adulterers.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+23%3A10" title="Jeremiah 23:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jeremiah 23:10)</span></a></span> The perilous times are upon us, and men and women are lovers of their own selves, more than lovers of God (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+3%3A1-7">II&nbsp;Timothy 3:1-7</a>). God designed in marriage and the raising of children a need for unselfishness that would put a restraint on the carnality of fallen man. When people imagine vain things and endeavor to cast away these cords and bands (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalms+2%3A1-3">Psalms 2:1-3</a>), they no longer get the benefit inherent in responsible behavior. Selfishness flourishes and natural affection becomes perverted. Adultery and neglect of the young are the result. This leads in turn to a complete breakdown of government and order. Perilous times, indeed.</p>

<p>Marriage is a commitment of a man to a woman (and vice-versa). From the beginning, God ordained that a man should leave his parents and be joined unto his wife (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+19%3A4-5">Matthew 19:4-5</a>). This leaving and this joining are full of implications which are profound and vital. It is the establishment of a new family unit, dedicated to the nurture of the young. God designed the process of parenting to have a profound effect on the couple (and everyone else in society as well). <span class="scripture">&#8220;<b>She shall be saved in childbearing</b>, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+2%3A15" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 2:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 2:15)</span></a></span>
This scripture is not speaking of the change of heart that is effected by the blood of Jesus. It is addressing the positive and beneficial effects of an unselfish dedication&#8212;the consecration of a mother to her children. God meant for us to take on the care of others besides ourselves. He wants us to <i>learn</i> to love others (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+2%3A4">Titus 2:4</a>). It is important that we learn to do so. If we do not learn to love our children&#8212;our husbands&#8212;our wives&#8212;then we are greatly at a disadvantage. It is our vineyard, the inheritance of our spiritual fathers and mothers, instituted by God Himself. If our vines are not doing so well, let us take courage and petition the Comforter to dig about us and dung us, that we may bear fruit in the vineyard of our fathers.</p>

<p>When the walls of marriage have been breached and the enemy has come in like a flood, the inhabitants thereof suffer fearfully, and great havoc is wrought. The situation calls for a great humbling. Perhaps you were not responsible for what happened, and you are a victim of sin and the consequences of sin. The root of bitterness may plague you. You may find it nearly impossible to forgive. Perhaps you are tempted to throw it all away&#8212;to conclude that there must be a better way than marriage.</p>

<p>I knew a young woman who suffered bitterly from her parents&#8217; failure. She told me once that she didn&#8217;t play as other children did&#8212;she sat and brooded. When she came to mature years, she deliberately turned away from marriage. She met a boy, devoid of understanding like herself. They experienced some feelings toward each other and began to live together as husband and wife. They did not make a consecration, &#8220;till death do us part.&#8221; She was fearful of such a consecration. Although they did not realize it, they made another consecration, a thin and shabby one. &#8220;Till feelings do us part.&#8221; This turned out about how you would expect. His feelings changed; hers had not. She was deeply hurt&#8212;again. What do you think she is like now?</p>

<p>Would she not have been exceeding wise to have humbled herself before God? &#8220;Lord, my father and my mother have made a failure. Sin did it&#8212;sin between each of them and You. I see that it might happen to me&#8212;so easily. Lord, please help me.&#8221; I tell you again, the situation calls for a great humbling.</p>

<p>The Lord can break the divorce-distrust cycle in our lives <b>if we will let Him</b>. He will help us to dig deep and get down to the bedrock of His truth. <b>God has been helping people to get established on His truth all down through the centuries.</b> He will help you and me, too.</p>

<p>When Daniel realized how his people had been carried into captivity in Babylon, he humbled himself before God. <span class="scripture">&#8220;In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem. And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes: And I prayed unto the Lord my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments; We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments: Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Daniel+9%3A2-6" title="Daniel 9:2-6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Daniel 9:2-6)</span></a></span> Note the manner of his prayer. Although he was not personally responsible at all for the judgment that befell his people, yet he said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;<b>We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled&#8230;&#8203;neither have we hearkened.</b>&#8221;</span> As if to say, <i>we</i> are all in the same boat. The wickedness which is our common characterization has brought us to this. There is no evidence at all that Daniel himself had rebelled or not hearkened, but he realized that the sin of his people had an effect on every individual, including himself.</p>

<p>If mother or daddy has not lived right, this has an effect on me. I am not personally responsible for their sin, but I must deal with its effect on me. If I do not humble myself and acknowledge the reality of the sin that has been done, I am liable to do as they did in one way or another, or to get into something else wrong in my efforts to avoid their error. By acknowledging &#8220;we have sinned,&#8221; Daniel was avoiding the attitude of heart of which his people were guilty. It was his way of escape.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the Lord pondereth the hearts.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+21%3A2" title="Proverbs 21:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 21:2)</span></a></span> We are conditioned by something, and because that conditioning is typically all that we have known, it seems right (familiar) to us. <span class="scripture">&#8220;As is the mother, so is her daughter.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+16%3A44" title="Ezekiel 16:44"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ezekiel 16:44)</span></a></span>
We got the feelings and values that we have from somewhere, and there is no real changing until we acknowledge our condition, renounce what is wrong, and call on God to teach us His ways and help us to do differently.</p>

<p>If you were raised in a home where covetousness was given place, it has an effect on you. If your background involves high-mindedness, you have it to face. If irreverence was practiced, if pride was manifest, if a sectarian loyalty was there, if lust was given a place, if vain and foolish things were there, if skepticism was characteristic, if laziness was a feature, or any other thing contrary to godliness and every good work, then you must confront the fact that this was your background. You must <span class="scripture">&#8220;ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established. Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+4%3A26-27" title="Proverbs 4:26-27"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 4:26-27)</span></a></span></p>

<p>To the extent that you give place to sin, it will ruin you. The more restrained one is in giving place to sin, the more profitable and blessed is the life. This is what a good moral life is&#8212;a life in which as much sin is avoided as possible. A spiritual life is vastly better&#8212;a life in which the works of the devil are destroyed in you, you are delivered, and you are one of those just persons which need no repentance (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+15%3A7%3B+1+John+3%3A6-10">Luke 15:7; I&nbsp;John 3:6-10</a>).</p>

<p>If the foundations have been removed in your life (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalms+11%3A3">Psalms 11:3</a>), the Lord can rebuild them in you. Listen to this scripture, <span class="scripture">&#8220;And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+58%3A12" title="Isaiah 58:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 58:12)</span></a></span> Stone by stone, the Lord will build a vision of the truth within you, and He will establish you on the Rock. He will so teach you the truth of His Word and so guide you with the Comforter that your life will blend with all the others who are His. Yea, the Lord knoweth them that are His. He will help you to discern and escape everything that is not of Him, and He will guide you to heaven in the end.</p>

<p>God is not experimenting with us. He knows what He is doing. When He designed the entire relationship of human marriage, He knew the end from the beginning. In spite of all the ruined homes, the devastated lives, the dashed hopes, the debilitating despair, and the wrecked and broken dreams, marriage still has the potential for blessings and joy that God created. He knows how to make the very best of your life that it can be. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A35" title="Hebrews 10:35"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 10:35)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+2%3A13" title="Philippians 2:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 2:13)</span></a></span></p>

<h2>The Infidel Doctor of Salem</h2>
<p>Effie M. Williams</p>

<p>A true account of events in a southern part of Missouri concerning a country doctor who was also an atheist. He was convinced of the reality of God and salvation through the experience of a young woman, Etta Work, who was saved from a worldly life and healed by the power of God. Dr. Molt was unable to satisfy himself that there was nothing to Christianity after seeing these things, and he was able to seek God and die with a testimony that he was ready to meet God.</p>

<p>This narrative also describes the sectarian rivalry of two congregations in town. The antagonism between them was so great,</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">to the extent that they were not willing to use the same kind of songbooks in their song service and always tried to arrange it so that they would have services at the same hour so that there would be no opportunity of passing from one church to the other. One evening as Preacher Bennet, the minister who pastored the flock of the faith of Preacher Light, was coming to preach to his people, he heard them singing &#8220;Will There Be Any Stars in My Crown?&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Will_There_Be_Any_Stars/index.html" title="Will There Be Any Stars?">*</a> and, as there were services across the street at the same hour, he heard them singing also, but their song was &#8220;No, Not One.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/No_Not_One/index.html" title="No, Not One">*</a></p>

<p class="citation"><span>[Williams, Effie M.; <i>The Infidel Doctor of Salem</i>]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>No doubt, this contributed greatly to Dr. Molt&#8217;s infidelity and provided a definite obstacle to his salvation. One wonders how many other people were hindered in that place (and other places, for that matter) by this shameful carnality and false profession. Oh, that men would take heed to the voice of the Master: <span class="scripture">&#8220;I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+17%3A23" title="John 17:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 17:23)</span></a></span></p>

<p>In spite of this obstacle and all other hindrances, God helped Dr. Molt to find Him. He also saved Etta Work. God is still helping all honest souls to find what He has provided for them and us.</p>

<h2>The Triumph of John and Betty Stam</h2>
<p>Mrs. Hudson Taylor</p>

<p>Published by Moody Press</p>

<p>At the time of their deaths at the hands of Chinese Communists in the 1930s, John and Betty Stam were a young missionary couple with what seemed to be a great potential for many years of useful service for the Lord. Suddenly it was over, seemingly tragically cut off short.</p>

<p>As we read this book, we appreciated the sensitivity of the author to God&#8217;s dealings in John&#8217;s and Betty&#8217;s lives. Through excerpts from much of their own writings (letters and poems), the work of the Lord in the hearts and lives of His children is evident. They had learned to trust and obey. They had learned to wait on the Lord. They had already died to themselves, and lived in Christ. They had learned something of what it costs to contest the enemy of our souls for his heavily fortified ground. The judgment day will reveal just how much God&#8217;s kingdom was advanced through their obedience unto death, but even what is revealed in the pages of this book is sufficient to prove the truth of the scripture: <span class="scripture">&#8220;And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+12%3A11" title="Revelation 12:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 12:11)</span></a></span></p>

<h2>Amos Fortune, Free Man</h2>
<p>Elizabeth Yates</p>

<p>Published by E. P. Dutton</p>

<p>His tombstone reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center first">Sacred
<br />to the memory of
<br />Amos Fortune
<br />who was born free in
<br />Africa a slave in America
<br />he purchased liberty
<br />professed Christianity
<br />lived reputably and
<br />died hopefully</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The story of Amos Fortune is loaded with gems, large and small. Rather than sketch out the story line, let me quote you a brief conversation between Amos and his wife:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">&#8220;Once, long years ago, I thought I could set a canoe-load of my people free by breaking the bands at my wrists and killing the white man who held the weapon. I had the strength in my hands to do such a deed and I had the fire within, but I didn&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What held you back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My hand was restrained, and I&#8217;m glad that it was, for the years between have shown me that it does a man no good to be free until he knows how to live, how to walk in step with God.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>

<h1>&#8220;I Write Unto You, Young Men&#8221;</h1>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first"><span class="scripture">&#8220;I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+2%3A14" title="I&nbsp;John 2:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 2:14)</span></a></span></p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Dear Young Men,</p>

<p>My attention was caught recently by the phrase <span class="scripture">&#8220;For he that will love life, and see good days.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A10" title="I&nbsp;Peter 3:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 3:10)</span></a></span> It occurred to me just how much this strikes at the depths of our desires. We may express it differently; we may approach it with some other motto or watchword; and yet, is it not our deepest aspiration to &#8220;see good days&#8221;? Is not a &#8220;good day&#8221; one in which we feel somehow fulfilled, that somehow we have &#8220;met the mark,&#8221; whether we are measuring by a measure we have imposed on ourselves, or a measure that is outside of ourselves? When you readers have finished a good book, when you laborers have completed a day&#8217;s work, when you organizers have finished organizing something, when you mental gymnasts have solved a puzzle, when you socially minded have had a good visit, when you helpers have been a great help, when you competitors have successfully competed, when you disciples have done what you believe the Lord asked of you, has it not been good? Do you not then love life?</p>

<p>I think that even on the basis of personal observation alone, I can safely conclude that most people are using or trying to use some means in which they are trusting to enable them to <span class="scripture">&#8220;love life, and see good days.&#8221;</span> I can also safely conclude that most of them have only limited success at it, because most of them are building on foundations that aren&#8217;t very sound. If you were going to build a house in which to live, in a completely unfamiliar environment, you would be wise to find someone you could trust, who was familiar with the environment and the available materials, to advise you. Furthermore, if you had never built houses before, you would do well to have experienced guidance. That&#8217;s really how all of us are in this life. We are building a life with no prior experience of our own, in unfamiliar territory, and learning as we go. Fortunately, God is not only an expert builder, He is willing and interested in helping us. So we find in the scripture this counsel:</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it. For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A10-12" title="1 Peter 3:10-12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (1 Peter 3:10-12)</span></a></span></p>

<p>If you examine the context further, you find that the inspired writer has just been talking about responding to evil with good, and now he is explaining why and how this is successful. He is, in effect, showing us how to build a good house under adverse conditions.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile&#8221;</span>: to refrain is to restrain or hold back. Guile is cunning, trickiness or deceit. When we are attacked in some way, there is an instinctual response to either fight back or flee. The tongue is a ready &#8220;fighter,&#8221; and it takes a great deal of self-control to restrain it when it is ready to fight. It is also able to use guile either to fight or flee. We might flatter, we might mislead, our lips may be used to get others into trouble in some way. But the Lord stands against all this, and calls us to hold the tongue back from these things.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Let him eschew evil, and do good&#8221;</span>: to eschew means to flee from, avoid, or shun. So not only are we restraining ourselves from returning evil for evil, but we are to flee from it, and do good instead.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Let him seek peace, and ensue it&#8221;</span>: to ensue means to follow or pursue something. Peace doesn&#8217;t just come, we must seek and pursue it. To make peace with God requires a seeking, a following after, a meeting of the conditions we find necessary on the way, until God sends His peace into us. When we are treated wrongly, we may find it necessary to press hard after the help God can give us to keep our peace with and from God. Also, inasmuch as it depends on us, gaining peace with them that are mistreating us.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil&#8221;</span>: God is watching and listening, always ready to help them that set themselves to follow Him. No matter what current outward circumstances may look like, the Lord disapproves and does not help those who want to do evil. The devil will, but God won&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Does this seem a high target, a noble and lofty ideal? For everything God calls us to, He stands behind it with the grace to attain to it. <span class="scripture">&#8220;His ears are open&#8221;</span> to the righteous. Are you feeling unable? The strength lies in God, not in you. Are you unable to get this help from God? Perhaps you are not yet made righteous by His blood. Seek Him with all your heart, and He will help you to <span class="scripture">&#8220;love life, and see good days.&#8221;</span></p>

<h1>The Pilot&#8217;s Voice: Part 2</h1>

<p class="author">Isabel C. Byrum</p>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">Byron has been getting into bad company lately, despite the warning of his mother and the faithful voice of his conscience. When his chance comes to steal some eggs, Byron really has to fight the warning voice.</p>
</div>


<hr class="minor" />
<p>When Byron returned from the mill, he struggled with the conviction that he should tell the whole thing to his mother. As he put off the warnings, many excuses for waiting came to mind. Mother would be better off not knowing just yet, he persuaded himself, and until evening he kept out of sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us talk, Byron,&#8221; Mother said that night, before he had a chance to slip off to bed. &#8220;My son, I want to you be protected from the sin and wickedness in the world, because I want the best for you.&#8221; For a long while she talked to him gently and earnestly about the dangers of liquor, tobacco, and opium.</p>

<p>Before she kissed him good-night, she asked kindly, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell me what is troubling you, dear?&#8221; But Byron only shook his head and hurried off to bed.</p>

<p>In the days that followed, his mother&#8217;s words, like tiny darts, returned to prick him. Again he felt he should tell her, but it seemed always easier to keep silent. Though he avoided looking in the hidden nest for eggs, the stolen money was in Byron&#8217;s pocket the next time the cousins went to the riverside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys,&#8221; James said, after the news had all been shared, &#8220;I have our pro­gram for this evening all arranged. There&#8217;s to be a dance at a public hall two miles away from here, and I thought we&#8217;d all enjoy attending.&#8221; Though Byron knew his mother disapproved because of the degrading influence of such a place, the older boys soon had him silenced.</p>

<p>The dance had begun when they entered and Byron found the gay entertainment quite interesting. His enjoyment was cut short when a tap on the arm startled him. &#8220;Hey, Byron!&#8221; It was a neighbor boy. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t ever think to see you here the way your mother disapproves.&#8221; Byron fumbled to make some excuse, but the evening was ruined as he ducked people he knew and tried remain unnoticed.</p>

<p>He was on a nervous edge when the boys finally gathered in a dim corner near a soft drink stand. &#8220;Now we&#8217;ll have some benefit from that egg money,&#8221; said James, and he ordered a cigar for each of them.</p>

<p>Why, I surely know better than this! Byron said to himself, as he remembered the hurtful and addicting effect tobacco has on the body. After several attempts Byron had a cigar lit, but he could not feel nearly so casual and merry as the others acted. For awhile he attempted to puff little clouds like the rest, but soon sickening feeling overcame him and he hurried outside for fresh air. James&#8217; consolation didn&#8217;t help much, and he was glad when they at last turned for home.</p>

<p>It was several days before Byron was able to shake off the bad feelings that night had left him with. When the week slipped past without his mother finding out, he felt at ease once more.</p>

<p>Several weeks later the boys were gathered in the hayloft of a barn when James told them of an adventure story he had been reading. &#8220;It&#8217;s nothing like those dry old textbooks&#8212;once I started I could hardly put it down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, James,&#8221; said George smugly, &#8220;if you have such an interesting book, we had better look it over.&#8221; James hurriedly brought out the book, which had a yellow cover, entitled: &#8220;The Life of Jesse James.&#8221; Though his mother had cautioned him against such reading, the outlaw&#8217;s daring robberies and escapes had soon fascinated Byron as well as the rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys, this is true courage,&#8221; said James, when he had closed the book. &#8220;And why can&#8217;t we have one of these adventures of our own? What thrills it gives me to think of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Byron&#8217;s conscience was now quite awakened again, and he protested hotly of the real &#8220;fun&#8221; of such recklessness. &#8220;Such things will surely get us into trouble,&#8221; he said. But the boys&#8217; only mocked his priggish notions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out a few nights with George and me and your fears will soon disappear,&#8221; said James as they parted. &#8220;Make your mother realize that you&#8217;re old enough to look out for yourself, and we&#8217;ll have a gay old time together.&#8221; Byron hesitated, but finally agreed to try it out.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>It was Saturday night, the evening on which this story began, that Byron made his trek through the woods toward his first adventure. His daring escape and determination to join the boys in a night of fun wavered as again he heard the pleadings of Mother. Oh, should he turn back and repent at her feet? But he knew what the boys would think of such ideas&#8212;he must take courage and shake off these fearful thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Byron?&#8221; James exclaimed, when he finally joined them at the meeting place. &#8220;Did the old woman try to keep you?&#8221; Byron flushed, but hid his hurt feelings as he listened to his friend lay out the plans. &#8220;First,&#8221; said James, &#8220;I must pick up the mail for the farmer I work for, and if you come along we can scheme up something on the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though the other boys talked excitedly all the way to the post office, Byron made the trip in silence. With reluctance he took the cigar that James bought him, but the memories of the dance hall made him toss it away as soon as he could.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, there&#8217;s a good pal of mine!&#8221; said George, as they came upon a group joking and laughing in the churchyard. &#8220;Come along on our trip, will you, Jason?&#8221; The older boy agreed with a grin, and soon the four were wending their way down the highway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Know old Davis?&#8221; George asked as they passed an orchard of young fruit trees. &#8220;He&#8217;s a stingy old codger and has been at my dad for a long time.&#8221; Byron protested, knowing the man to be a friendly neighbor, but George only sneered. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show him a thing or two,&#8221; he said, and began slicing bark from several of the trees. Byron was startled, but other boys only grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, boys,&#8221; said Jason, &#8220;Let&#8217;s have a chicken roast tonight. I know where some fat hens can be found.&#8221; They followed him to a fine old house and watched as he slipped into the darkness. Suddenly the flapping of wings and a few smothered squawks broke the silence. With one accord the boys broke into a run and headed for the river.</p>

<p>Byron had hardly caught his breath with Jason joined them, a hen in each hand. A sickening feeling filled him as he watched the older boys pluck the strangled birds. The excitement filled him with fearful thoughts, and brought to mind his mother&#8217;s parting words. Was she still awake praying for him?</p>

<p>With longing for home, Byron followed the others along winding paths and highroads to an abandoned house. After prodding at the doors, Jason smashed a window and crawled inside. Soon the door flew open and he called out, &#8220;Step into my parlor, boys!&#8221;</p>

<p>Byron stepped in&#8212;and looked with disdain at the rubbish that littered the room. The others began heaping it up to make a fire on the old hearth, and soon the dark room was lit with crackling flames.</p>

<p>After a bit James said, &#8220;Why, what&#8217;s the matter with Byron? It looks like he&#8217;s seen a ghost&#8212;but perhaps all this is too new for him.&#8221; He smiled at Byron, whose face was quite pale, and added, &#8220;But I guess we&#8217;ve all been raised differently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you grew up without any raising, James,&#8221; George said with a wink. Byron couldn&#8217;t help joining in the laughter, but he didn&#8217;t feel like eating when the others began roasting chunks of meat over the fire. The smell of burnt chicken, smoke, and grime all made him think more longingly of home. There every advantage was awaiting him&#8212;and he had left it all to sit among thieves.</p>

<p>As the night wore on, Byron became so tired that he could scarcely keep awake. After a bit Jason pulled out a pipe and said, &#8220;When sleep takes its departure, this is the greatest comforter I have.&#8221; The tobacco smoke added to the bad odor and sickened Byron more, but he propped himself up as a pack of cards were brought out.</p>

<p>The time flew away as the four of them sat playing game after game in the flickering light of the fire. Suddenly George glanced out the window and exclaimed, &#8220;Boys, I do believe it&#8217;s getting light! We better get out of here before&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then a rooster crowed, and forgetting the fire, the boys fled out into the darkness. Byron followed James back to the farm he worked at, and the two slipped into the hayloft to catch a few hours of sleep.</p>

<p>Byron couldn&#8217;t sleep long, and as he listened to the farmer do his early morning chores, he thought of his own work at home. They would soon have family prayers, what will Mother say about me? He could almost hear pray, &#8220;O Lord, have mercy! Be with Byron and bring him safely home to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a few hours later when the boys walked to Sunday school (because they would be suspected if they didn&#8217;t), and Byron&#8217;s thoughts continued to tumble in his head. James had lied to the farmer to cover up their night-time ramblings, but Byron only felt more condemned. If Jonah were severely punished for disobeying, what would happen to him for the crimes he had committed?</p>

<p>Mother was sitting in the chapel as he had expected, but he couldn&#8217;t return her smile. He slid into a seat next to James and listened intently as the teacher spoke on following God&#8217;s guide chart to have a happy and safe life. He knew it was true, but his path was far different.</p>

<p>As he stood thinking, his mother came up and said pleasantly, &#8220;I hope you boys had a good evening together.&#8221; Byron couldn&#8217;t speak for the tight feeling in his throat, but James came to his rescue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes we did,&#8221; he said with a smile. &#8220;We stayed at the house and had a fine time reading our Sunday school lesson.&#8221;</p>

<hr />
<h2>Consider:</h2>
<p>Many times a day we make choices, either good or bad. In the first paragraph Byron made a choice. What was it? Though it seemed like a good idea, was it really?</p>

<p>As you read the story you can tell that Byron is not going in the right direction, but into more and more trouble. Why is that?</p>

<p>Count to see how many times warnings were given to turn from evil and do right.</p>

<p>Did Byron enjoy his time at the dance? Why not?</p>

<p>What is wrong with smoking cigars or cigarettes?</p>

<p>What made the book about Jesse James interesting to the boys? How could have Byron been truly brave?</p>

<p>When we hide the truth, make excuses, or tell lies it is a danger signal that we are on the wrong path. Can you give an example of this from the story?</p>

<p>Even though Byron didn&#8217;t enjoy his night with the boys, he stuck with them. Why?</p>

<h1>Being Thankful</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>I want to share some thoughts with you from a Sunday School lesson I heard recently. It was on being thankful and what benefits could be gained. How easy it is for the enemy to bring discouraging things to our mind, which will result in complaining&#8212;the opposite of thanksgiving. They can be over such little things as happened to me the other day. My husband and I were grocery shopping together. I was out of liquid Dove which I use in my bath water. I went down the soap aisle and picked one up and brought it back to the shopping cart. My husband asked how much it was and I told him. He thought we could get it less expensive somewhere else and advised me to wait. So I put it back. The devil began talking to me: &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t know you had already added water to the last little bit over a month ago to stretch it out. And you know you have been watching the ads for it to be on sale at Walgreens, Target and Wal-Mart for a long time now. How unfair of him! He buys things he wants!&#8221; Sisters, does this sound familiar to you? I am sure I&#8217;m not the only one the devil works on! Let&#8217;s watch out here. We can be under the law of our husbands, doing it in the wrong spirit of submission and miss the blessing the Lord has for us. The Lord helped me to resist those ugly thoughts and cling to the scripture, &#8220;all things work together for good&#8221;; perhaps it will be on sale next week, or it is possible it would be a lower price at another store. The enemy will try anything to rob us of our victory, thus making us a poor example in the home. A couple of evenings later&#8212;I found a sack with a bottle of Dove inside. He had found it cheaper!</p>

<p>The first verse of the lesson was: <span class="scripture">&#8220;And let the peace of God rule in your hearts&#8230;&#8203;and <b>be ye thankful</b>.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+3%3A15" title="Colossians 3:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 3:15)</span></a></span> Let&#8217;s meditate on the word <i>rule</i> a minute first. Webster says <i>rule</i> means, &#8220;an established guide for action, conduct; a fixed principle that determines conduct; habit; custom: as, morning prayer was a rule of the household.&#8221; If we keep the peace of God in our hearts, it will be a natural outflow to be thankful, will it not?</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+1%3A12-14" title="Colossians 1:12-14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 1:12-14)</span></a></span> As we work to feed and clothe our family, we have the privilege of letting our minds dwell on what God has done for us. Thank Him for saving our souls from sin and for being partakers with Him. Isn&#8217;t this is the greatest blessing of all!</p>

<p>Then there are the temporal blessings. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him. For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass. When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+8%3A6-10" title="Deuteronomy 8:6-10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Deuteronomy 8:6-10)</span></a></span>
Having a fountain of thanksgiving welling up within the soul begets obedience. Let&#8217;s not get lifted up in pride and forget from whence all our blessings have come. The Lord does bless us with earthly things, but that is not what the Lord wants to show the world through us. Think of Job and how God allowed the devil to test him. We do not admire Job for his riches, but his integrity and attitude when the trials came. Job magnified the Lord in his losses by saying, <span class="scripture">&#8220;The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; <i>blessed</i> be the name of the Lord.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Job+1%3A21" title="Job 1:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Job 1:21)</span></a></span> One definition of the word <i>bless</i> is: &#8220;to feel gratitude toward.&#8221; Just think of it; feeling gratitude toward God in all his sufferings and losses! Lord, help us to measure to all His word. And the Lord was grateful to Job for his integrity and <i>blessed</i> Job back again. What a wonderful, loving God we serve! It seems to me that thanksgiving is a short-cut to victory in our trials.</p>

<p>Have you ever thought about what David said about the <i>sacrifice</i> of thanksgiving? He said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+107%3A21-22" title="Psalm 107:21-22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 107:21-22)</span></a></span> Sacrifice means &#8220;a giving up,&#8221; or &#8220;foregoing of some valued thing for the sake of something of greater value.&#8221; Do you really think the Israelites <i>felt</i> like sacrificing the most beautiful lamb of the flock? That would be the one most desirable for a pet! Are we petting some of our desires or feelings? Are we willing to sacrifice our feelings of being misunderstood, our desires being denied, or&#8230;&#8203;? And just obey the Lord and give Him thanksgiving for it all. It is up to us. If we chose to obey the Lord, He will help us in our times of need (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+50%3A14-15">Psalm 50:14-15</a>).</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;<b>In every thing give thanks</b>: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+5%3A18" title="I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:18)</span></a></span> There is something protective and beneficial about giving thanks in all things. It&#8217;s like a heavenly chariot carrying you away from troubles and anxieties. Didn&#8217;t the song writer say,</p>

<p class="verse">Oh, what peace we often forfeit, oh, what needless pain we bear,<br />All because we do not carry everything to God in prayer!<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/What_a_Friend_We_Have_in_Jesus/index.html" title="What a Friend We Have in Jesus">*</a></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication <i>with thanksgiving</i> let your requests be made known unto God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+4%3A6" title="Philippians 4:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 4:6)</span></a></span> Many things can leave scars, but giving thanks brings healing. When we can say thank you for taking care of the need; it is in His hands and we can be thankful.</p>

<p>There is guidance in thanksgiving. Ever hear anyone thank the Lord for cigarettes, alcohol, or something they stole? If you have acquired anything you cannot thank the Lord for&#8212;you better re-examine! <span class="scripture">&#8220;And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+3%3A17" title="Colossians 3:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 3:17)</span></a></span></p>

<p>It is a wonderful thing to be able to thank the Lord. I am greatly encouraged to nurture more thanksgiving in my life. It is our choice how we set our sails. If we set our will to be more thankful in our trials, God will surely do His part to fill your heart and home with His love and thanksgiving in this new year.</p>

<p>A sister in the Lord.</p>

<h1>How Do I Mend This?</h1>

<p>The woodstove is glowing and the family is gathering in for the evening. Father is sitting in his big chair, ready for an evening of reading literature, communication and family devotions. Mother brings the basket of mending from the sewing room. As a young girl, she read that a pioneer girl&#8217;s hands were never idle. She wove that thought into her life and she&#8217;s still at it.</p>

<p>Much money can be saved by learning to weave yarn into the thinning soles of heavy socks. Instead of having to buy more socks, by reinforcing them you can get another year&#8217;s wear from them.</p>

<p>It is easier to mend before a hole is worn, but take courage, you can mend that hole! An old-fashioned darning egg is very helpful, but any rounded, smooth object which fits easily into the sock, can be used. (A light bulb works well.) Clip off any loose threads around the hole. For the best results use wool yarn for wool socks and cotton darning thread for cottons. Do not knot the thread, for a knot will be uncomfortable. Instead, start the darning by taking several small stitches in the material, about 1/2 inch from the hole (Fig. A) Turn the stocking and take another row of stitches beside the first one. Cover the hole with lengthwise threads, each row ending in six or eight small stitches which cover at least 1/2 inch of the weakened area around the hole. Crosswise threads (Fig. B) are woven in and out, over and under the lengthwise threads. Crosswise threads should extend 1/2 inch beyond the worn edges of the hole, with small stitches in even rows.</p>

<p>What a reward to put the mended sock back in the drawer. Your husband won&#8217;t have to tie that pair in a knot to prevent getting a hold of it again!</p>

<blockquote><p class="first">From <i>The Lure of Divine Love</i></p>

<h1>The Love of Woman: My First Awakening</h1>

<p>I was pressed into child marriage when too young to know the first intimations of the &#8220;love of woman&#8221; planted by nature in every woman&#8217;s being, dormant and inoperative until awakened.</p>

<p>I loved (for I was born with a strong love nature), but it was the love of a child, and was happy if I could but win the approval of my husband. But the &#8220;love of woman,&#8221; which is vastly different, was yet to have the first awakening. A few years later, among the farm laborers who boarded with us for a few weeks, was a young man about husband&#8217;s age, recently from the east. He was of fine open countenance, cheerful, and quietly entertaining among the men, and carried with him a clean, uplifting atmosphere, and in contrast with the slow, uncouth men about him, was like a rare gem among gravel stones.</p>

<p>He came and went with the men to their meals. I was always reticent, retiring, and seldom spoke, and not once by word or look was there the least indication that he was in any way attracted toward me. But the presence of that young man awakened in me something that I did not know ever existed. I did not understand what it was that so strangely sweet had stirred the depth of my being, and I was silent with wonder and astonishment.</p>

<p>He was an admirable character, and everyone was drawn toward him, husband with the rest, and I found myself thinking what an ideal husband and father he would be, and wishing husband was like him. I began to draw comparisons, and a feeling of aversion arose toward husband, before it began to dawn upon me that this was the awakening of that pure, natural love that is inherent in every woman&#8217;s breast, with all the beautiful ideal that goes with it; and I saw my danger, and was afraid.</p>

<p>Fortunately for me, I was converted before I was married. Though I had long since broken step, and had wandered far from the Lord, yet in this secret conflict with love and duty, I had no recourse but God. It was a long-drawn-out battle, for I did not know how to meet it. I buried it in my bosom and tried to forget it, but every time husband would speak of the young man, which was frequent (for he specially liked him), that smoldering fire would flame up, only to be buried deeper still. There was nothing impure about this love, it was normal, perfectly natural, the beautiful, intrinsic inheritance that the Creator has placed within womankind. It was a part of the plan of God. But that child marriage had interfered with God&#8217;s beautiful plan, and much in consequence had been forfeited. The purely natural, normally right, and beautiful under other circumstances, must at once be absolutely denied, for to follow the natural now would be a crime freighted with (to all connected with it) dire destruction.</p>

<p>Duty, stern, hard, and uncompromising though it seemed, was perfectly clear, and you know that the path of duty, after all, is the only path of ultimate happiness for all concerned, although at times it may appear to be the very opposite.</p>

<p>I suffered silently and fought heroically, steadfastly resisting every temptation, and that continuous inarticulate heart cry finally formulated itself into one brief sentence: &#8220;O God, for Jesus&#8217; sake, take out of my heart this forfeited love for this man, and give me love for him who is lawfully my life companion and the father of my child.&#8221; (Instinctively I felt I should never mention this to my husband, for I had not wronged him or anyone else, not even in deliberate thought. The whole thing was entirely between my own soul and the Lord.)</p>

<p>One never-to-be-forgotten day came the answer to that heart cry, and it was far beyond what I had asked or thought. Such a river of Divine love was turned in through my heart that &#8220;the love of man&#8221; that had been awakened for the beautiful ideal, of which this noble stranger seemed to be the embodiment, was elevated, transmuted, and reinforced by the love of God (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+3%3A1">I&nbsp;John 3:1</a>), and bestowed upon the one to whom I was bound by law. The change was marvelous, and I loved this man, my legal consort (who in many ways was far from being lovable), with a love that was unfailing under the stress and strain of years.</p>

<p>Occasionally for awhile, the temptation of &#8220;vain regrets&#8221; would be presented, but resisted at once; with grateful praise for the deliverance, and that flowing stream of Divine love, it would quickly pass, and the incident soon became (like many other hard places in life) only a precious memory of the Lord&#8217;s mercies (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Lamentations+3%3A22-26">Lamentations 3:22-26</a>).</p>

<h1>With the Fruit of Her Hands She Planteth Seedlings</h1>

<p>Whether you have had a garden or want to grow one this year, starting seedlings inside is a good place to begin. We&#8217;ve found that all you really need for a good set up is a fluorescent shop light (position it to hang about 8-10 inches above a shelf or counter), some potting soil, containers, and of course, seeds. Starting your own garden plants indoors is useful and enjoyable, besides affording many object lessons for your children. Here are some hints of what has worked well for us:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you don&#8217;t have leftover plastic pots/trays to use, try cutting down margarine or cottage cheese cartons to 1&#8221; tall and poke a few holes in the bottoms. This is the basic seed-starting container and a number of them can be put on a jelly-roll tray for watering.</li>

<li>Use sterile seedling potting mix to prevent problems with fungus growth which will kill seedlings (called &#8220;damping off&#8221;). Before filling containers, moisten soil with warm water until it is damp, but not soaking.</li>

<li>Sow seeds (see chart below) thickly in the containers; cover with plastic or enclose whole tray in a plastic bag. This keeps the seeds moist until they sprout. Keep seeds in a moderately warm place (without light) and remove plastic as soon as first shoots come up.</li>

<li>Put newly sprouted starts under light, adjusting it so that the light bulbs stay about 4 inches above their leaves. If the soil stays moist, your seedlings can be easily watered by pouring water into the tray. A good fertilizer to use is called Roots Plus for Seedlings (code #07-257) and is sold in concentrated form by Gardener&#8217;s Supply (their number is: 1-800-863-1700).</li>

<li>When the plants get their second set of leaves (first true leaves), it is time to transplant them to their own little pots. Fill the new pots part way with dampened soil, carefully set in a dug-up seedling (hold it by its leaves to prevent the stem from breaking), and pat soil in around its roots and lower stem. Tomatoes should be buried up to their top leaves, if possible, to encourage sturdy plant growth.</li>

<li>Give your plants water and light until they are ready to take to the garden. Before dumping them into the cold spring soil, though, take the extra time to adjust them slowly to outdoor life (starting with a couple hours in a shady protected area). And if the weather is still snappy, protect your transplants with row covers or plastic.</li>

</ul>
<p>Find your last spring frost date and count back to know when to start each kind of vegetable.</p>

<h1>&#8220;All Things&#8230;&#8203;&#8221;</h1>

<p>Recently, I was very blessed to see many things come together in just that way. For some time I have been struggling with the issue of truly submitting to my husband. I kept thinking, &#8220;If only he would do this or that, things would be much better.&#8221; Of course, he didn&#8217;t, and I got nowhere. I tried and tried, only to run into a brick wall. I knew, to a point, the role I needed to fulfill, but something was obviously missing.</p>

<p>My daughter prints a Christian newsletter, and about this time I received a letter from the mother of one of her subscribers. This very dear lady publishes her own newsletter and through it and some of her letter to me, I could see that she was being the submissive wife I longed to be. Anyway, for the next few months I kept fighting with this. The relationship with my husband grew more strained and distant. About this time my family went on a week long camping/hunting trip. While the others were away at camp, I had a lot of quiet time to pray and seek. Much to my shame, I had noticed for some time the submissive attitude of my daughter and I asked myself again, &#8220;<i>What</i> am I missing?&#8221; &#8220;<i>Trust</i>&#8221; was the answer God gave me. Trust in my Father above. Now I knew this in my head and I did trust Him in many areas. But the Lord brought this into my heart and I can now say to Him, &#8220;<i>You</i> are in complete control of all things. I don&#8217;t have to worry or struggle or try to manipulate things to how I think they should be because <i>You</i> are bigger than any problem, any circumstance.&#8221; What peace and joy and freedom this brought!</p>

<p>But there was still one problem. Because of some ongoing problems, I had some wrong feelings and attitudes towards my husband. What was I to do with these, how was I to get past them? One night, a couple days later, while lying awake in bed, God gave me these words, &#8220;Abide with Me.&#8221; I was looking at circumstances&#8212;they were draining me and dragging me down. I needed to abide in the Father, which is to continue in Him, which is to persist without pause. My whole being is to be centered on the Lord.</p>

<p>The other aspect of this is God&#8217;s love. Without His love in my heart, I cannot properly love others. It&#8217;s easy to love the pleasant traits, but difficult to accept the unpleasant ones. His love can do both. Proof of that is <span class="scripture">&#8220;in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+5%3A8" title="Romans 5:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 5:8)</span></a></span></p>

<p>I realize that God will not reveal these truths to our hearts until He knows the time is right and we are ready. I was finally ready, and again, what freedom I felt! I had been carrying around a burden that was not mine to carry. How foolish and blind; yet I hadn&#8217;t understood and I hadn&#8217;t been ready to completely lay aside self.</p>

<p>When we arrived back home, waiting in the mail for me was a magazine. The lady I mentioned earlier had it sent to me and much to my amazement, the topic was wifely submission! There were several articles discussing this and clearly outlining what it is, and the harm a wife does to her husband when she doesn&#8217;t submit. It fit&#8212;all too well. The things I wanted to change in our marriage were good changes&#8212;my desires were right, but I was destroying the very thing I wanted to change. True, deep, real change comes from the Lord and it was me He changed! Praise God! I find it so interesting and funny how God will work in paradoxes. Thankfully He does work.</p>

<p>To the young ladies reading this&#8230;&#8203;you have the opportunity to learn this truth now, if you haven&#8217;t already. I didn&#8217;t become a Christian until I was about 26 and it&#8217;s taken me 14 years to learn this. What heartache and time have been wasted, but I have to &#8220;look ahead&#8221; as the apostle Paul says. Even if your home life is not all that it should be, submit to your parents, as unto the Lord&#8230;&#8203;for He knows the plans He has for you.</p>

<p>&#8212;Michelle Stace</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>Thank you, Michelle, for sharing your experience and how the Lord has helped you. I am reminded of a time when the Lord got it over to me that my husband couldn&#8217;t hear what the Lord had to tell him, if I were always busy talking about a certain change I wanted. The Lord taught me it was much better to pray and let the Lord talk to him about it.</p>

<p>We invite others to share what the Lord has done for them. Each life is full of experiences. We want to be of profit one to another.</p>

<h1>We Trusted in God: The Maiden&#8217;s Years of Waiting</h1>

<p>The title is true, &#8220;We Trusted God.&#8221; How easy it is to look to some earthly one for counsel and not to look to our Savior for His supreme love and guidance. Let&#8217;s face it: more effort, more concentration, more time on our knees, more consecration, more dying to our own desires is required in seeking the Lord in prayer, versus leaning on someone else to make this important decision. God alone knows the future and can see the needs of each person and how He wishes to use each individual in His body of believers. Parents, ministers, and others who are living close enough to the Lord will also recognize when the Lord is putting His hand upon a young man and a young woman for marriage. Parents, we need to be instructing and training our children to listen for the voice of the Lord in all the smaller decisions of life. Then when they come to this so great a decision of a life mate, they will already know the voice of the Lord and how He deals with them.</p>

<p>It seems hard to begin telling my own story, and I&#8217;ll have to admit, I&#8217;ve been dragging my feet to get it out. It all seems to be such an extremely personal and private thing between God, my husband, and I. But if it can be a blessing to someone out in the reading audience, I pray the Lord may be glorified.</p>

<p>I had no idea the number of years I would have to wait when I first began praying for the Lord to give me the companion of His choice. During those years of waiting the Lord had things to teach me. My friends, one by one, all got married. Even my younger sister was being courted. I would be in the kitchen washing dishes on Sundays while she and her friend could be seen out in the yard. The devil tried to stir up jealousy in my heart toward her. Not that I wanted her friend, but that I was the oldest and it seemed fair that someone should court me first. The Lord had a special message at a campmeeting for me. The minister&#8217;s text was jealousy in connection with <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A3">Ephesians 5:3</a>, in speaking of different fruits of the flesh. <span class="scripture">&#8220;But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints.&#8221;</span> The point was emphasized over and over: Let not jealousy be once named among you. I went home and prayed earnestly for victory. It was a struggle; the devil wasn&#8217;t going to give in easily. I remember praying silently in my heart while I was on hands and knees mopping the floor, as well as praying behind closed doors. The Lord did give the victory! I&#8217;m thankful I struggled, and by God&#8217;s help, won. Since then, I have heard of older girls in similar situations who really gave their younger sisters a hard time. It is so good to look back and thank the Lord for the victory He gave! If it were not for God&#8217;s grace, the story would have been different.</p>

<p>I was earnestly seeking the will of God for my life during my years of waiting. My parents had lived a happy, godly life before me and I desired a companion and home of my own, also, if this were the Lord&#8217;s will. Some of the time was used to make quilts and linens for my hope chest. There was ample opportunity to learn gardening and canning skills. There were times to meditate and sing while going to the pasture to bring the cows home for milking. Often, time was taken to spend a few moments talking to the Lord beside some farm equipment in the quietness of the pasture. Going down the lane I remember being blessed with the song in which the chorus says,</p>

<p class="verse">Light breaks at last! Hallelujah to God!<br />Darkness is past, let us shout it aloud:<br />From the mountains and hills let us gather the few<br />Who will stand for the right, and dare to be true.<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Light_Breaks_at_Last/index.html" title="Light Breaks at Last">*</a></p>

<p>I learned a lot about waiting upon the Lord. Have you ever realized how many scriptures talk about waiting? During those years the Lord was always pointing them out. I will share a few that were especially precious to me. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And therefore will the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+30%3A18" title="Isaiah 30:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 30:18)</span></a></span> As is usual with the Lord&#8217;s dealings, more of God&#8217;s mercy can be seen now than in those years of waiting. Waiting can be rather heavy business, like a big rock in your path, and the Lord knew we would get weary. If you are in this place in life, be encouraged by this scripture: <span class="scripture">&#8220;He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: But they that wait upon the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+40%3A29-31" title="Isaiah 40:29-31"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 40:29-31)</span></a></span> Many times I prayed, &#8220;Lord, if you don&#8217;t want me to marry, please take the desire away.&#8221; The Lord gave this scripture for an encouragement: <span class="scripture">&#8220;I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer&#8230;. And the Lord answered me&#8230;. For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Habakkuk+2%3A1-3" title="Habakkuk 2:1-3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Habakkuk 2:1-3)</span></a></span> The Lord was teaching Habakkuk to wait in faith for an answer. What a privilege to share in some of the same teaching the Lord had given Habakkuk! I prayed, &#8220;Lord, if you do have a companion for me, give me love for the one of your choice. If I am attracted to anyone who is not your will, please do not allow it to happen.&#8221; I really wanted the Lord&#8217;s will more than anything. I knew my own choice could bring me disaster. While waiting on God, the devil will make you think you ought to be &#8220;doing something.&#8221; But the Lord got it across to me that if I were waiting and &#8220;doing nothing&#8221; as far as seeking a husband on my own, I was doing something! Just waiting on God was just exactly what He wanted me to do. What a great sense of security in God that thought brought.</p>

<p>Then there were campmeeting times with the opportunity to meet other young folks from various places. These meetings can be a great blessing, but the devil comes along, too, to detract your attention from the spiritual if you allow him. It is only natural for one to wonder whom the Lord has for you and also to be tempted to look around on your own. In communication with the Lord, instruction was given to get my eyes off the boys and to keep it on Him; that my attention should be directed in becoming a spiritually proper mate. We were taught it was wrong to date and trifle with affections. Nor were the older ones willing to accept responsibility to act as the Holy Spirit in choosing spouses for the younger. They instructed us to seek God and forsake our own thoughts, as God only knew best for our future. They prayed for us and were willing to agree in prayer and give counsel. I appreciated this so much. It was sound and did work, if you had totally died out to yourself. That is the concern. Many have thought they had the mind of the Lord and have been mistaken. Their own desires overshadowed what the Lord had in mind to bless them with.</p>

<p>I am reminded of a little story to illustrate this point. A mother had in mind to take her little girl to the store and buy her a beautiful doll. Upon entering the store the little girl immediately fell in love with a little, inexpensive one. The mother was ready to move on, as she knew there was a better one. The little girl cried and begged for that little doll, not knowing that Mother had something much better, if she would just wait. In this case the mother insisted on the child giving up the object of her affection and led her to the best choice. But the Lord doesn&#8217;t insist on us giving up our own way. He wants us to volunteer our will. I was afraid to take my own way. The scripture was heavy upon me, where David was speaking of the Israelites: <span class="scripture">&#8220;They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel: But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalms+106%3A13-15" title="Psalms 106:13-15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalms 106:13-15)</span></a></span> Marriage is the most important decision one can make in life besides that of choosing to serve the Lord. So great an impact it has on your life it can mean your destiny in eternity. It has been said that if you marry out of the order of the Lord, you have to struggle very hard to keep what spirituality you have.</p>

<p>The Lord allowed me to work at some jobs at home and also in protected environments. During my 26th year, the Lord began to talk to me about a vacancy at a gospel printing house. I really didn&#8217;t want to go, and waited, hoping someone else would be burdened to fill the need. Prayer requests were put in over and over that this need would be filled. &#8220;Lord, can&#8217;t you send someone else?&#8221; But the Lord didn&#8217;t. I was the one who was supposed to go. Word was communicated to my parents. They were not against it, but Daddy did say he hated to see me quit the good job. I was one who always tried to please my parents&#8212;-so this made me hesitate. Prayer was continued. We went to a gospel meeting where a young minister preached on the great need of consecrated service, and how many places were vacant for the want of consecrated laborers. This greatly increased my burden and then I was ready and willing and anxious to go. It also touched my father&#8217;s heart and upon arriving home, he gave his willing consent. As I look back on the three and one-half years spent there, I can truly say it was some of God&#8217;s preparing ground for my marriage. It was a good education in a lot of ways. I lived with two other girls and a housemother during that time. It was a real eye-opener to see how different people can be in all the habits of life! How good the Lord is to train us for what lies ahead. <span class="scripture">&#8220;How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+11%3A33" title="Romans 11:33"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 11:33)</span></a></span> Surely He knows what is best.</p>

<h2>Note</h2>
<p>In the fall of 1999, I found myself in the situation of having the entire ministry of <i>Dear Princess</i> placed upon my shoulder where a short time before two of us found the burden almost more than we could handle. This went on for a time as an issue was expected shortly by our readership, but the actual work was less than complete. Through that time the Lord refined us much and in due time lifted the load through the merging of the old magazine with the new of which you are reading. When this happened the relief was so great on our part and the emotional strings which were torn and buried, now resurfaced and we found ourselves in a battle in which we no longer felt a burden for this publishing work. For several months I have carried on, half numb and not with the burden I knew was necessary, simply because no other was ready to fill the place to serve the young women. The result was this place was not filled, only the name that carried this responsibility was dutifully printed as well as with a few articles that I managed to fill up my allotted pages. I want to apologize for this. For you, as readers, suffered by not receiving the books and back issues you requested or answers to your questions or having very belated orders at the least. I hope I can express how sorry I am that I was not able to meet your needs promptly. Thank you for your patience with me. I appreciate the longsuffering exercised.</p>

<p>And now to the present. I have pleaded with the Lord to bring someone to fill this place, but His answer has been, <span class="scripture">&#8220;My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+12%3A9" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 12:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 12:9)</span></a></span> He has spoken to me that I was not the one to start this ministry, to place myself in this position, and I cannot leave. He has not released me, and I apologize for acting like He had. I covet your prayers as I feel very small before the Lord and request that you pray that I would serve you in the order, direction and fear of the Lord. May God be magnified.</p>

<p>Postscript: Last issue we mentioned praying about a headcovering discussion. As of this issue, we don&#8217;t feel clear in moving ahead on that. We feel the need to pray more about it and focus on other things at this time.</p>

<h1>Which One Is God&#8217;s Formula?</h1>

<p>&#8220;So what do you think about dating vs. courtship vs. betrothal?&#8221;</p>

<p>Recently our family took a trip across the states visiting some subscribers. In every home this question was addressed, and, among us girls, a discussion generally formed. Face to face, or on paper, we have heard about your digging to find a better way than dating; the beginnings of how you learned about courtship, and now, for some, the more &#8220;complete&#8221; way of betrothal. We&#8217;ve had open ears as you&#8217;ve shared how you have struggled to stand by your decision, despite pressure from relatives and your own feelings. We&#8217;ve seen how you want to find the &#8220;right path&#8221; no matter what the cost. And our heart is right along in there with you: wanting God&#8217;s way and His blessing. None of us want to have any regrets.</p>

<p>With this in mind, we have been burdened that the paths of courtship and betrothal that are so popular now (in the homeschooling group anyway!), may actually be false security blankets, leading us blindly down a path whose end is not what we desire. As I write, I feel keenly my lack of experience in this line and feel hesitant that I can get across what I feel burdened to share. I haven&#8217;t been there, and the concepts I&#8217;m advocating are not based on experience. However, there are some things I&#8217;d rather not learn firsthand, but prefer to listen to God&#8217;s voice and heed His warnings. As this subject is one that comes up frequently at this time in our lives, I have sought God&#8217;s direction and have been surprised at how His teaching differs so widely from the &#8220;spirit-led&#8221; methods to find a companion. I&#8217;ve been concerned about these popular formulas that distract, at best. And out of love, I&#8217;d like to share why I do not accept dating, courtship or betrothal.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re all familiar with the concept of dating and it is widely accepted that this is a moth-eaten, foolish way of finding your companion. We&#8217;ve endlessly discussed how putting ourselves in situations that will lead to multiple heartbreaks is a set-up for divorce. It has been proven that the emotional baggage that comes from this is damaging to a future marriage, while wasting our single years in frivolous fun, alternating with tears from the wretchedness of sin. The risks are too great, we say&#8212;God&#8217;s way doesn&#8217;t cause such damage and pain. So we condemn and move on. But before we do, let&#8217;s consider&#8212;are these the only reasons we left dating in the dust? I don&#8217;t know about you, but I left (emotional) dating because it is destructive to trusting in God. How can we trust God for our companion if we are out there &#8220;choosing&#8221;? How can we trust and lay our all on the altar if we&#8217;re out there indulging in fleshly lusts (emotional or physical)? I left dating, not because the heartbreaks were unbearable, but because otherwise I couldn&#8217;t live a victorious life in Christ.</p>

<p>Pain and sorrow are a part of life; but there are two kinds. There is the suffering of a sinner&#8212;pain without remedy, anguish without comfort&#8212;trouble and travail they brought upon themselves. God saves us from this. We are spared this hopeless heartache. Then there is the pang of grief that comes when a friend goes back on God, a sibling surrenders to Satan&#8217;s control, a situation we had high hopes in falls apart&#8212;there is pain and suffering there, too, but God is a comfort. God encourages and teaches us lessons that ease the trial. Life, in general, is made of sorrows that God turns to gladness.</p>

<p>Many do not hold that opinion. They think when they find God&#8217;s way, it will be perfect and painless. Since dating doesn&#8217;t fit that protocol, they move on. God&#8217;s way <i>is</i> perfect, but <i>not</i> thorn-free. Was Christ&#8217;s path without sorrow? Let us not seek to leave off pain, but instead seek the Comforter. Leaving dating behind to escape heartache is not a good enough reason.</p>

<p>Courtship is the answer to many, many people searching for something foolproof. In leaving dating, many people were concerned about emotional purity. Parents don&#8217;t want their daughter giving her affections away and having strong ties with a young man, only to be broken. A bone is never as strong once shattered though it may be able to once more be used for walking&#8212;it will remain weakened. So it is with our hearts&#8212;regardless if we emotionally/mentally date or physically do so; once our hearts have been crushed and broken time and again, we become calloused, but very weakened to make a strong commitment with true love. But why do people who date separate? From my grandmother&#8217;s perspective, who was popular and dated continually in her highschool/college years, dating relationships have a very poor foundation. You dated John because he was tall and handsome and had a car. You dated Karla because she had blonde hair and a pretty laugh. Sometimes your decisions were based on something deeper than that, but not much. With so little of virtue to start with, is it surprising the relationships don&#8217;t last? No parental guidance is yet another drawback to more serious thinkers. Young people, overall, are lighthearted and are interested in having a &#8220;good time.&#8221; (Christ sobers us down if we live for Him.) Parents, having lived longer, should see some of the dangers and want to shield their children. Courtship seems to provide the serious foundation (we&#8217;re not just out to &#8220;have fun&#8221;) as well as lend itself to a family atmosphere. Both families are involved and chaperones accompany the couple. Marriage is the obvious objective. During this time, the formula specifies that much prayer be offered and the Lord&#8217;s will sought, as the couple falls in love. When they feel ready to finalize their commitment, they become engaged. This method has been tried, worked by some, but for others had disastrous results. They found that while in the courtship process, they fell in love, yes, but soon they found glaring points that showed clearly it was not God&#8217;s will. Their separation was even harder than the common dating breakups because of the serious foundation they started on. I know a girl now of whom the scars of this happening twice have had the effect of hindering her spiritually.</p>

<p>And so, some people, seeing the holes in this pattern of courtship, conclude that courtship is not it. They see the &#8220;open-endedness&#8221; and feel it must be closed. It is essential, they say, that the Lord&#8217;s will be known first and foremost, before the couple has a chance to emotionally attach. We will use betrothal, they decide&#8212;eliminate courtship and become engaged in a binding way so there is no chance of backing out. Then, at last, there will be no breaking of hearts. The common questions: how do you know it is the right one without getting to know them?, etc., are easily answered&#8212;the father of the girl should spend time corresponding with the young man, getting a feel for his tastes and goals. We will go through the parents, they say, who have no emotional attachment problems to deal with, and they will test the waters. If the waters are good, they ask the young people to join them in praying if the two should marry. If they feel it is God&#8217;s will, they are betrothed.</p>

<p>To this theory, I would like to raise some questions. Is this really as cut and dried as it sounds? Is it really foolproof? As I&#8217;ve pondered, the thought of my accountability has arisen. It is I who will pledge to love, cherish, and honor someone until we part in death. For all the counsel and loving guidance my parents can give, I still stand responsible for my actions and vows. Despite if I entrust myself to my parents, and they assume responsibility for consequences, on the judgment day, God will be looking at me. But I generally get the results of choices before I face God. How will the elect method of betrothal affect my marriage? If I trust my earthly father, who is a limited human being, to get to know my life companion for me, is he also going to give me victory in my battles when we fulfill the scripture, that they that marry shall have <span class="scripture">&#8220;trouble in the flesh&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+7%3A28" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 7:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 7:28)</span></a></span>? He cannot do so and it would be dangerous for him to try to fill the role of the Holy Spirit guiding and teaching me. I do not say this to be independent&#8212;I want to remain teachable and open&#8212;but I must be led by the Lord myself, because God is my source of victory and strength, and I must answer to Him for every thought, word, and deed.</p>

<p>I also venture the thought that my parents are not free from human feeling&#8212;they personally may prefer one young man above another. They may <i>emotionally attach</i> themselves to someone who may not be God&#8217;s choice for me. It may not be intentional, but if they hear a voice other than God&#8217;s, they can plunge me into a situation where I am joined with the wrong one. I recently heard a story of a young woman whose father made a mistake and got her involved in a betrothal situation that was clearly not of God (her father did not see it that way at first). By the mercy of the Lord she was able to get out, but not until after wedding rings were bought and house plans were being considered by others involved. This young lady said that she cried unto the Lord and said, &#8220;What happened? I wanted to do it right.&#8221;</p>

<p>No heartache? I&#8217;m afraid betrothal, too, is not foolproof. As we said about dating: pain and sorrow is not a good enough reason to run to courtship. If we&#8217;re switching from courtship because of its open-endedness, and going to betrothal, does not the same reasoning apply?</p>

<p>What is the purpose in writing this? Everyone is familiar with the principals of each formula. My burden in bringing this up yet another time is concern that these methods are actually leading us to trust in them rather than God. Each method is trying to &#8220;do it right&#8221;&#8212;each gets tighter, trying to eliminate problems that arise. It seems people are desperate to find the foolproof formula. But there is not a perfect method. We have found dating has its obvious holes; courtship, as a theory, a method, is not trusting God any more. It really is a sort of more serious dating one person at a time, in a family setting. Betrothal is, in effect, trusting your parents. What is there left to put our faith in?</p>

<p>My dear sisters, why don&#8217;t we just let go of all this baggage and trust God? Why don&#8217;t you just quit searching for just the right formula and let go and let God work? We can&#8217;t put God in a box. You may say, &#8220;I am trusting God through my parents in betrothal.&#8221; That&#8217;s a nice screen to hide behind, but it doesn&#8217;t hold water, because we can&#8217;t have a relationship with God through other people. Not even our parents. <span class="scripture">&#8220;I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+15%3A5" title="John 15:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 15:5)</span></a></span> Our parents, though they have parental authority over us, are only branches as we are. We cannot have Life through another branch. We must put our trust in the Vine. Our strength comes directly from Him.</p>

<p>You say, &#8220;Well, then what do I <i>do</i>? If I don&#8217;t have the formula of dating, courtship or betrothal, then what do I put my trust in?&#8221; Well, that is the blessed and most glorious part. When we get past all the different labels and forms and throw them out the window, then we can get down to doing the only thing that matters&#8212;trusting God! You say, &#8220;That&#8217;s all?&#8221; That&#8217;s right, praise the Lord; we don&#8217;t have to do anything else. We free God to work any way He chooses when we put it all in His hands and trust, trust, trust! Praise the Lord! It is wonderful just to trust God! Do you know sisters, what we need to do? We need to quit looking for the perfect method&#8212;that isn&#8217;t the point. We have been totally missing it and we need to humble down and commit ourselves to God. We need to consecrate and die until we are all emptied out and there is nothing left of self. God knows what is best. Let&#8217;s stop trying to make God work a certain way, because is simply no use to try to stuff our Lord in a cage. It seems that this is really the trouble&#8212;we are up and doing, when we should be down and praying, being still before God. We need to die to ourselves until, if given the choice, we would not move our hand for marriage or not. Likewise, we would not lift our finger to alter the way God would bring it about. Let our ideas be slain, then and only then can the Lord freely work.</p>

<p>We are uncertain at this time in our lives. We are young and we know not what is before us. It is dark and there is a mist that seems to be clouding our vision. We do not know what path is right to take. Let&#8217;s seek God, who knows it all. Like the songwriter expressed:</p>

<p class="verse">God is working out His purpose,
<br />He has planned for you and me,
<br />Though from us it may be hidden,
<br />Someday we shall plainly see;
<br />How He stands behind the shadows,
<br />Waiting to perform His will.
<br />Whispering, &#8220;Child be of good courage,
<br />Every purpose I&#8217;ll fulfill.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">God is working out His purpose,
<br />Never murmur nor repine,
<br />For the future&#8217;s in His keeping,
<br />Gladly to His will resign;
<br />When the veil at last is lifted,
<br />And the shadows flee away,
<br />We shall understand His purpose,
<br />Through one glad eternal day.</p>

<h1>He Can</h1>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first"><span class="scripture">&#8220;He&#8230;&#8203;hangeth the earth upon nothing.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Job+26%3A7" title="Job 26:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Job 26:7)</span></a></span></p>
</div>


<p>In looking to God for deliverance of any kind, we are prone to try to discover what material He has on hand to work on in coming to our relief. If we are praying for financial help, we are apt to look over the community to see if we can think of anyone whom the Lord might influence to lend some money. If there are no apparent probabilities in that direction, we find it difficult to believe for hard cash.</p>

<p>If it is employment we need for the continuance of our bread and butter, we make diligent inquiries in the industrial centers, and if we find that the shops, stores, and factories are more than full-handed, it is pretty hard work to be hopeful that we are going to get work.</p>

<p>If we are ill and there is no hopeful signs or relief from pain, it is not at all easy to convince ourselves that we are going speedily to recover.</p>

<p>It is human to look and crave for something in sight that will help the Lord out. In time of need, if we can only find a little of something for God to begin on, we seem to be much better satisfied. To need a sum of money and not to be able to think of a friend, a man, or a monied institution from which it might be obtained, gives a dark background to the scene. To need work, and to find that throngs of others as needy as yourself are also idle, makes the human outlook very dark. To be in bed day after day, feeling no better, but rather worse, bills increasing, business suffering, and patience giving out, makes a situation in which relief does not seem very probable. The trouble is, there does not appear to be a single human prospect to begin on. The outlook is all liabilities, with no resources to help out.</p>

<p>Now, to God&#8217;s child, what is the real situation? Are there nothing but liabilities? Much in every way. Are there no resources? Yea, thousands, millions, billions, trillions. Where are they? Above you, below you, around you. Earth and air are full of wealth untold. Can&#8217;t see it, eh? You don&#8217;t need to see it. Keep your eyes on Him. Just think a moment. It is not at all necessary for you to see help in sight, nor is it really necessary for God to have any relief on hand. He does not need anything to begin on. <span class="scripture">&#8220;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+1%3A1" title="Genesis 1:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 1:1)</span></a></span> What did he make them out of? Nothing, absolutely nothing. When the earth was made, what did he hang it on? <span class="scripture">&#8220;He&#8230;&#8203;hangeth the earth upon nothing.&#8221;</span> Pretty satisfactory earth to be made of nothing, eh! Remember, not a scrap of anything was used in making it. It hangs all right, doesn&#8217;t it? Very well, then. A God who can make an earth, a sun, a moon, and stars out of nothing, and keep them all hanging on nothing, can supply all your needs, whether He has anything to begin to work with or not. Trust Him and He will see you through, though He has to make your supplies out of nothing.</p>

<h1>On the Ocean of Life</h1>

<p class="author">Kathryne Helm</p>

<p class="verse">Your soul&#8217;s like a ship on the ocean of life,
<br />With its rolling billows, and the aves of strife;
<br />When you have not traveled this ocean before,
<br />How can your own hand guide you safe to the shore?</p>

<p class="verse">Here lie sunken rocks and great reefs and shoals,
<br />And the dangers unseen there are manifold.
<br />There are maelstroms and whirlpools that draw one down
<br />Till they helplessly sink to the depths and drown.</p>

<p class="verse">Your great need is Jesus, a Pilot so true,
<br />Who will stand at the &#8220;wheel&#8221; and pilot you through.
<br />So relinquish the helm to those nail-scarred hands;
<br />He has traversed life&#8217;s sea and He understands.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8217;Twas His love brought Him down from heaven, for thee,
<br />And the proof of that love is dark Calvary;
<br />And He knows all the dangers upon life&#8217;s troubled sea.</p>

<p class="verse">To trust Him, your Friend will relieve your distress,
<br />He&#8217;ll pilot you through to the haven of rest.
<br />You&#8217;ll rejoice all through time and eternity,
<br />That you ever did let Him your Pilot be.</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Abigail,</p>

<p>Hello! I finally made time to write you. Everyone is always saying how busy they are, and I am no exception.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_3/Let_It_Not_Be_the_Outward_Adorning/index.html" title="Foundation Truth 3/Let It Not Be the Outward Adorning">make-up/jewelry discussion</a> was very helpful. Some time ago I gave up wearing jewelry because the Bible was so clear about it, and the whole idea of jewelry goes against an attitude of humility. Anyway, the discussion helped to affirm my convictions. I feel I should say something, though, about something you wrote, Abigail. You wrote: &#8220;If we take such a course [dressing in a worldly way], I am afraid, my sisters, we shall indeed meet the King, only to be turned away&#8230;.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" name="If we take" href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_3/Let_It_Not_Be_the_Outward_Adorning/?anchor=If we take#If%20we%20take" title="Foundation Truth 3/Let It Not Be the Outward Adorning">*</a> This sentence gave me the impression that if we do not obey the Lord in this area, we will be subject to eternal condemnation! I do not believe that God would condemn us for the sin of unwillingness in a particular area. For <span class="scripture">&#8220;we all stumble in many things.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+3%3A2" title="James 3:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 3:2)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New King James Version">NKJV</span> A Christian who dishonors the Lord will suffer loss, but not condemnation (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+3%3A11-15">I&nbsp;Corinthians 3:11-15</a>). Now if a person turns away from God altogether, God will, of course, destroy him (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+3%3A17">I&nbsp;Corinthians 3:17</a>). I&#8217;m not coming down on you, Abigail. I love you, and I just thought I should say something about this. Two other people I know who read the article were disturbed by that sentence as well. I&#8217;m glad to write to you, knowing you are a truly dedicated Christian. I love true Christian fellowship!</p>

<p>About a discussion on headcoverings&#8230;&#8203;I at first wanted to say, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want to hear one; it is confusing to me and I could never wear a head covering.&#8221; But the Lord reminded me that no matter how &#8220;crazy&#8221; a thing He asks me to do, if I am doing it, who cares what people will think!? Oh, there is such a joy in God&#8217;s perfect will! So if God is leading you to have a discussion, go ahead! Since we&#8217;re on the subject of a woman&#8217;s proper appearance, I wanted to mention something. <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A3">I&nbsp;Peter 3:3</a> says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Do not let your adornment be merely outward&#8212;<b>arranging the hair</b>.&#8221;</span> I know, of course, that we should not have fancy hair styles and spend a lot of time on it, but what in the world should we do with it? I can&#8217;t leave it messy or hanging all over the place? You do not have to answer these questions if you don&#8217;t want, but this subject might make a good discussion for the magazine. I will continue to seek the Lord in this.</p>

<p>I will be praying for you and for all the rest behind Foundation Truth. I would appreciate prayer, too!</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p class="noindent">Dear Alanta,</p>

<p>Thank you for writing and voicing your concerns and questions. You mentioned in your letter that others had concerns about the statement made also and we thought there may very well be many people who had questions, but are remaining silent. Therefore we are answering this letter to the general audience for those who are interested.</p>

<p>I said, &#8220;If we take such a course, I am afraid, my dear sisters, we shall indeed meet the King, only to be turned away&#8230;.&#8221; In this, we were speaking of those who knowingly disobey God&#8212;and in this instance, in the sin of wearing adornment. In summary of your question, &#8220;Is this a big enough sin to keep us out of heaven?&#8221; What will bar us from having the <span class="scripture">&#8220;right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+22%3A14" title="Revelation 22:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 22:14)</span></a></span>? To answer this, let&#8217;s ask ourselves this: what is heaven, and who is it for? <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+22">Revelation 22</a> tells us that, <span class="scripture">&#8220;there shall be no more curse.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+22%3A3" title="Revelation 22:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 22:3)</span></a></span> What is the curse? The curse of sin&#8212;heaven is without sin, pure and holy, without a blemish. Heaven is for those <span class="scripture">&#8220;that do his commandments.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+22%3A14" title="Revelation 22:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 22:14)</span></a></span> If heaven is a holy, pure place, like we are told, as it says, only those who obey can enter in. Not even one little tiny disobedience or sin can be excused because it would mar heaven&#8217;s purity. It doesn&#8217;t matter how big or little the sin is&#8212;it is still sin and makes a spot. God has good eyesight, and He isn&#8217;t going to let heaven get all spotted up. So we know that if we read in God&#8217;s Word that we are not to wear gold, or costly array, etc., and we say, &#8220;Well, I just don&#8217;t want to do that,&#8221; we are sinning&#8212;because we&#8217;re disobeying God&#8217;s commands. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+4%3A17" title="James 4:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 4:17)</span></a></span></p>

<p>You mentioned the scriptures in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+3%3A11-15">I&nbsp;Corinthians 3:11-15</a> in regard to this subject: <span class="scripture">&#8220;For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; every man&#8217;s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man&#8217;s work of what sort it is. If any man&#8217;s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man&#8217;s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so by fire.&#8221;</span> These scriptures are not speaking of the judgment day, in which context you seem to be using them. If we try to fit them in that way, they contradict the teaching that heaven is pure and holy. Heaven would then have to be interpreted as a place of degrees of holiness&#8212;some places less pure than others for those who didn&#8217;t quite follow all of God&#8217;s plan. But God does not accept lukewarmness&#8212;He says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+3%3A16" title="Revelation 3:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 3:16)</span></a></span> No, the scriptures in 1 Corinthians simply mean that everyone has a house (life) to build. Perhaps they start upon the foundation of salvation; as their life continues, they will build either gold and silver or hay and stubble. In the days to come, fiery trials (as we all know!) come to test and try us&#8212;if we have built rubbish into our structure, it will perish, though we ourselves will be salvaged, if we take our trials the way God has intended. If we have built true, strong things in our lives, through our trials (fire) we shall indeed receive a reward, according as our work has been. God means for us to live our lives building precious stones, gold, and silver, and we are blessed if we do so. He has victory for us so we do not have to have hay and stubble (false, weak things) inside of us. God intends for us to live pure and holy so we can go and spend eternity in a pure and holy heaven.</p>

<p>About the headcovering discussion, as mentioned <a href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth_4/Editorial/index.html">before</a>, we&#8217;ll not be having one for now. We do feel the subject is important&#8212;we used to be confused for many years about it, but God has taught us some things we&#8217;d like to share sometime, but as of yet, we haven&#8217;t felt God&#8217;s go-ahead command. So we&#8217;ll just wait on God.</p>

<p>Your question on arrangement was interesting. I hadn&#8217;t really thought about <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A3">I&nbsp;Peter 3:3</a> particularly before in that context. I was praying about it and looked it up in my KJV and was surprised that the meaning is some different than the version you quoted; it says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair.&#8221;</span> It doesn&#8217;t say, &#8220;<i>arranging</i> the hair,&#8221; it says &#8220;plaiting.&#8221; Plaiting and simply arranging are two different things. Plaiting, to the best of my knowledge, is a fancy braid in which ribbons are entwined as you braid. I&#8217;ve seen it done before&#8212;it takes some time, but has a very &#8220;pretty&#8221; effect. Gold, beads, and who knows what all are braided in and termed plaiting. It&#8217;s also pretty plain from the scripture that this plaiting is an outward adornment that can, obviously, be taken on or off&#8212;and since women&#8217;s long, uncut hair is Biblical, and not an adornment, it cannot be speaking of simply taking care of our hair. Taking care of our hair comes back to your question, what do we do with it?! I can understand the frustration&#8230;&#8203;! No, we don&#8217;t have to leave it all messy and hanging around in our way. God isn&#8217;t glorified by that. There isn&#8217;t a Bible command on how to fix it&#8212;I think God has left us with room for taste and preferences. I feel that God would have us to arrange our hair in a way that is the least assuming possible, takes the least time, and is not a temptation to men. For me, that means putting my hair up&#8212;which takes about 10-15 minutes of my time each day. It&#8217;s out of my way and doesn&#8217;t attract attention, for the most part. In these personal issues, we need to seek God for His will for us. Someone else may be able to arrange their hair in a way that if I did so would open me to a temptation of pride. We need to be sensitive to the voice of the Lord telling us those secret things that makes our relationship with God a very personal one. Let&#8217;s just get down very low and humble and seek the face of the Lord, and we can be assured that once we do our part, He will not forget His.</p>

<p>May God bless you, Alanta. I hope this has answered your questions. Feel free&#8212;anyone is welcome&#8212;to write in and share your thoughts. We love to hear from you!</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">Note: We received the following letter too late to go into last issue&#8217;s discussion. We have felt the points mentioned are worthy of being considered and so are printing it here.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>Grace and peace be to you in the Lord Jesus Christ! I feel called to this discussion on the wearing or not wearing&#8212;of jewelry and make-up by Christians, as it is a subject I feel I have not seen addressed very much in the various Christian books and periodicals of our time. I pray the Lord will guide my words and help me to avoid anything that does not glorify Him in my writing.</p>

<p>&#8230;&#8203;If you were to peek into my daily life you should see a woman in plain, button-up cotton shirts paired with a long denim skirt&#8230;&#8203;doing everyday manual labor, much as my mother did during her lifetime. Mother was the one who governed our dress, and she and Father decided to stop wearing jewelry when I was quite young, so I did hear my parents tell relatives that jewelry would not make an acceptable birthday present for me. The church we joined stresses the importance of modest, plain dress, but I did not ever see a standard being set or followed at the church meetings; people tended to do as they please. My position comes not from habit nor from my church, but from God&#8217;s Holy Word, and the understanding of it with which He has so graciously blessed me.</p>

<p>The Bible teaches many principles that apply to the Christian&#8217;s manner of dress and adornment, just as it contains guiding principles for every aspect of life. These include that the dress should be plain and humble, that it should not be a cause of temptation to lust, envy or pride to the wearer or beholder; cross dressing is forbidden (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+22%3A5">Deuteronomy 22:5</a>); interpretations of this prohibition vary quite a bit. Our attire should not be expensive, elaborate so as to display an impression of superiority and expend our Lord&#8217;s money excessively upon ourselves while others are suffering want. The Holy Word also presents more specific examples: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Not with&#8230;&#8203;gold, or pearls, or costly array.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+2%3A9" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 2:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 2:9)</span></a></span> This passage is often quoted by advocates of modest dress and to condemn tight-fitting clothing, short skirts, loud colors, and worldly hairstyles, which I also avoid and disapprove; but I marvel at how rarely mention is made of its application to jewelry and make-up. I feel in my own conscience I must translate &#8220;gold or pearls&#8221; to mean jewelry of any kind, whether pinned or sewn onto clothing or worn on the person, whether made of real gold, or silver, or plastic or whatever. (Note: some practical items, watches and hair accessories, are made to function as jewelry, and others are not; I do not have a problem with the latter.) And I firmly believe that who reads and knows these commands of the Lord has obligation to seek His strength to obey them. We cannot insist that He approve of our way because we think our heart is right. It cannot be right living in disobedience after light on the subject has been given by the Lord.</p>

<p>We may argue that Bible women&#8212;and men&#8212;wore jewelry, particularly in earlier times (Rebekah, Israelites leaving Egypt, etc.), but we also find even in the Old Testament places where the people were commanded to strip off their ornaments. As for make-up, such women as Jezebel painted their faces. It was a common practice among idolaters and those influenced by idolatry, who believed, based upon their false notion that the deity &#8220;was altogether one like themselves,&#8221; that they could impress, change and persuade Him to be more pleased with them by outward acting and dressing. The Pharisees in Christ&#8217;s time also had the same misconception. In addition to making their own rigorous rules and ceremonies beyond what God had commanded, they also wore fine clothing to denote superiority, and armlets, and phylacteries, and long, showy fringes on their robes (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+23%3A5-7">Matthew 23:5-7</a>). Jesus commended those who were not attired in fine clothing, and&#8230;&#8203;the Lord taught Christians in New Testament times not to adorn their bodies.</p>

<p>I am a very strong believer in face-to-face communication, in one-on-one witnessing and heart-to-heart sharing. The only way this can be godly and uplifting is when our hearts and minds are off of all that is merely external, and our outward appearance does not contradict this. We want to see each other the way the Lord sees. We desire that the graces of Christ shall shine in our countenances, and sincere concern be expressed in our eyes. We do not want the gospel message to have to travel to others through a passage obstructed with distracting ornamentation and make-up. If the image of my face remains in someone&#8217;s memory after I have delivered to that person an earnest and solemn message I felt the Lord would have me share, I do not want him/her to walk away remembering boldly painted lips, dancing earrings, glittering gold or shadowy eyes with charming eyelashes. These things will <b>get in the way</b> of God&#8217;s Spirit of grace shining forth, rather than accentuate it.</p>

<p>Let us also beware of looking upon outward appearances and letting tasteful adornments attract us when we are associating with others who wear these things. Outward beauty, whether natural or artificial, whether inborn or put on, should not attract us above those qualities which God regards as beautiful and precious. While the most charismatic and photogenic, the most talented and tastefully dressed, may and often do conceal an impatient, exclusive, egotistical and inconsiderate character, many a common old Jane or Joe in plain work dress with plain, simple looks, will be found a wonderful, fun, godly, compassionate friend.</p>

<p>This should be kept in mind when meeting a prospective friend or a prospective marriage partner. I should not want it to be &#8220;love at first sight&#8221; because of his beautiful eyes and tidy dress&#8230;. And I definitely don&#8217;t want someone to be attracted to my side, first by my looks, or, worse yet, by looks that are put on to make me appear more than I am without them. Sisters, never worry that you were born ugly or unattractive! It is the ugly temperament and habits that turn good people away; a sweet spirit hidden within the plainest, roughest exterior, with artificial or natural adornments, cannot help but shine forth and make you more lovely for the godly seeker to behold than the most gorgeous girl or woman who has not <span class="scripture">&#8220;the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A4" title="I&nbsp;Peter 3:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 3:4)</span></a></span> Never forget this and start seeking to do for yourself what only God can do properly. Take the best possible care of your physical and spiritual health, cultivate thankfulness and a helpful, patient disposition, and you will be a good friend and make good friends.</p>

<p>For those of you who dress very modestly in other respects, jewelry may not seem like such a big deal. But the biblical injunctions still hold true. Are we putting something before God? Are we preferring to wear Jesus&#8217; cross as an ornament instead of taking up our cross and following&#8212;obeying&#8212;Him? Let us take up our cross and follow Him until the end!</p>

<h1>Complete in Him</h1>

<p class="author">L. E.</p>

<p>Complement. The word means something that completes or makes perfect. We talk about complementary colors, how clothes, houses, or places may or may not suit us, or how someone is our &#8220;right hand.&#8221; We find satisfaction in a &#8220;perfect match,&#8221; whether in a jigsaw puzzle or how the sofa fits the living room. And there is pleasure in knowing that we have fulfilled a need or someone has filled ours.</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t that how we envision marriage&#8212;finding the &#8220;right one&#8221; for me, the perfect fit, my complement? If we have been privileged to see it working in Bible order, the completeness of two parts making a whole, we desire that satisfaction. But it is not dreaming that will bring it to us. It is in accepting the proposal already given&#8212;by the only One that brings satisfaction.</p>

<p>There is a completeness our Lord has designed for us in Him. We may question, how can He really when I can&#8217;t touch or see Him? But this experience goes deeper, closer to our hearts than any human relationship. And yet we can relate it to our ideal of marriage in a very meaningful way. How? Let me endeavor, by God&#8217;s help, to show you.</p>

<p>When we really sit down and soberly consider what we&#8217;d want in a life partner, we begin to study character, and particularly, the principals, vision, personality that we can admire. We want someone that will capture our heart, but is also enduring and faithful. Someone to love us, not only on the surface, but when we show our worst side. When nobody else understands and cares, will he? The ideals rise up high enough to check off any ordinary mortal being. But don&#8217;t despair; there is yet a Prince who surpasses our wildest dreams.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice. My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Song+2%3A9-10" title="Song 2:9-10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Song 2:9-10)</span></a></span> The endearing names charm us, the desire of belonging calls us, and the visage of strength and beauty thrills the heart. Would you not have Him call you His Delight, Treasure, and Desire? Then He must be called Best-Beloved, Lord, and Heart-Love. Marriage is a two-way relationship; it takes effort on both sides. This Prince has given us His all that we might be entirely His own. But it will only work if we make the vows and stick to them.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take this relationship step-by-step. First we hear about the man and we have our first impressions, but when we discover his intentions we must come to a decision. He&#8217;s asking for me. We first consider our interest in the matter, do we not? What does he have to offer that I want? But when we get down deeper, we make our choice on the lasting and permanent: where will this take me? So when Jesus calls for our heart, we must count the cost. Regardless of past feelings or questions, this offer calls for a serious answer. I give my all to Thee, or, I don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Why would I give my all to Him? Are there any good reasons? We&#8217;ve been talking about how He&#8217;s everything a heart could wish for. We have reason to believe in His character. There is a call in our heart to belong, despite all the fight and the desire of our own way. All our reason and nature desires love, someone to adore, to serve, to be complete in.</p>

<p>But sometimes the damage and hurt is so great that fear and mistrust overrule all else, and then what? Then He says, &#8220;Try Me, prove My love, come to the haven of rest I&#8217;ve provided.&#8221; He has all we can desire or need. All. So why refuse? Because we want our freedom, independence, to be untouched, and protected from being hurt again. But is this reasonable or fair? As our Maker, He has first right to our life because He knows so much better how to make us truly happy. And with His own life blood He has proven His proposal of love on Calvary.</p>

<p>This proposal can not be received as a ticket to a party. Like wedding vows, it is &#8220;for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness or in health.&#8221; Unless we have the determination of Ruth to cling, not caring that the future would have cares and hardships, we will be turned away. We must say from the heart: Intreat me not to leave Thee, or to return from following after Thee: for wither Thou goest I will go; and where Thou lodgest, I will lodge: Thy people shall be my people, for Thou art my God. But if we take the step seriously, we will most certainly have no regrets. He satisfies the soul as no one else can.</p>

<p>We were created to not be complete in ourselves. We were created to need something far higher and superior to lean on and find a refuge in, and that need finds its fulfillment in Christ. How is He our completeness? We want love, and He overflows with it. We want to be understood, and He knows our deepest thoughts as well why we think them. We want to be protected and shielded from trouble, and He calls us unto Himself&#8212;the Good Shepherd, Defender, and Refuge. We want peace and happiness, and this He will bestow if we give ourselves fully to His care. We want a hope, of which hope He is, an anchor to the soul in life&#8217;s greatest storms. We want someone to count on, to know all the answers, to be ever available, ever compassionate, always full of power, and He is more than we can imagine. We want a hero to admire and exalt, and that is His just due.</p>

<p>Complete in Him. I have experienced it and found it true and satisfying, like that perfect match of colors that never fails to thrill you, or that well-worn garment you can&#8217;t bear to trash, or a bite of that food you&#8217;ve craved all morning. It is a relationship to begin on, and continue growing in through the weeks and months that follow. When something would creep in to spoil my peace, I, like a good, young bride, need to renew my focus and draw near Him. When I am getting fretful or concerned, it is time to take time to talk alone together. And through the day, just as I would dream a wife would do, let me extol and rest my mind on Him, seeking every little way to please Him and bring out His smile. Then will I be satisfied in the completeness of His presence, alive in Him alone.</p>
