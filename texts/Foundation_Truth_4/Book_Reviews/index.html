<h2>The Infidel Doctor of Salem</h2>
<p>Effie M. Williams</p>

<p>A true account of events in a southern part of Missouri concerning a country doctor who was also an atheist. He was convinced of the reality of God and salvation through the experience of a young woman, Etta Work, who was saved from a worldly life and healed by the power of God. Dr. Molt was unable to satisfy himself that there was nothing to Christianity after seeing these things, and he was able to seek God and die with a testimony that he was ready to meet God.</p>

<p>This narrative also describes the sectarian rivalry of two congregations in town. The antagonism between them was so great,</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">to the extent that they were not willing to use the same kind of songbooks in their song service and always tried to arrange it so that they would have services at the same hour so that there would be no opportunity of passing from one church to the other. One evening as Preacher Bennet, the minister who pastored the flock of the faith of Preacher Light, was coming to preach to his people, he heard them singing &#8220;Will There Be Any Stars in My Crown?&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Will_There_Be_Any_Stars/index.html" title="Will There Be Any Stars?">*</a> and, as there were services across the street at the same hour, he heard them singing also, but their song was &#8220;No, Not One.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/No_Not_One/index.html" title="No, Not One">*</a></p>

<p class="citation"><span>[Williams, Effie M.; <i>The Infidel Doctor of Salem</i>]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>No doubt, this contributed greatly to Dr. Molt&#8217;s infidelity and provided a definite obstacle to his salvation. One wonders how many other people were hindered in that place (and other places, for that matter) by this shameful carnality and false profession. Oh, that men would take heed to the voice of the Master: <span class="scripture">&#8220;I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+17%3A23" title="John 17:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 17:23)</span></a></span></p>

<p>In spite of this obstacle and all other hindrances, God helped Dr. Molt to find Him. He also saved Etta Work. God is still helping all honest souls to find what He has provided for them and us.</p>

<h2>The Triumph of John and Betty Stam</h2>
<p>Mrs. Hudson Taylor</p>

<p>Published by Moody Press</p>

<p>At the time of their deaths at the hands of Chinese Communists in the 1930s, John and Betty Stam were a young missionary couple with what seemed to be a great potential for many years of useful service for the Lord. Suddenly it was over, seemingly tragically cut off short.</p>

<p>As we read this book, we appreciated the sensitivity of the author to God&#8217;s dealings in John&#8217;s and Betty&#8217;s lives. Through excerpts from much of their own writings (letters and poems), the work of the Lord in the hearts and lives of His children is evident. They had learned to trust and obey. They had learned to wait on the Lord. They had already died to themselves, and lived in Christ. They had learned something of what it costs to contest the enemy of our souls for his heavily fortified ground. The judgment day will reveal just how much God&#8217;s kingdom was advanced through their obedience unto death, but even what is revealed in the pages of this book is sufficient to prove the truth of the scripture: <span class="scripture">&#8220;And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+12%3A11" title="Revelation 12:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 12:11)</span></a></span></p>

<h2>Amos Fortune, Free Man</h2>
<p>Elizabeth Yates</p>

<p>Published by E. P. Dutton</p>

<p>His tombstone reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center first">Sacred
<br />to the memory of
<br />Amos Fortune
<br />who was born free in
<br />Africa a slave in America
<br />he purchased liberty
<br />professed Christianity
<br />lived reputably and
<br />died hopefully</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The story of Amos Fortune is loaded with gems, large and small. Rather than sketch out the story line, let me quote you a brief conversation between Amos and his wife:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">&#8220;Once, long years ago, I thought I could set a canoe-load of my people free by breaking the bands at my wrists and killing the white man who held the weapon. I had the strength in my hands to do such a deed and I had the fire within, but I didn&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What held you back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My hand was restrained, and I&#8217;m glad that it was, for the years between have shown me that it does a man no good to be free until he knows how to live, how to walk in step with God.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Amos&#8217; life portrays a man who learned &#8220;to walk in step with God.&#8221; Good family reading or for your adolescent readers.</p>
