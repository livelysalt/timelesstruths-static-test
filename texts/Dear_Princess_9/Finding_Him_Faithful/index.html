<h1>Finding Him Faithful</h1>

<h2 class="subtitle">Meet Two Princesses: Fairlight and Claire Meyer</h2>
<hr class="minor" />
<h2>Please tell us about yourselves, your goals, interest, and values.</h2>
<p class="noindent"><b>Claire:</b> My name is Claire Elizabeth Meyer; I was born (delivered by my daddy) on June 12, 1982. I&#8217;m generally a quiet person (although not when Mommy, Fairlight, and I are talking late into the night&#8230;&#8203;which we do with astounding regularity)&#8230;&#8203;probably a phlegmatic, for those ofyou who are into personality types. I think my spiritual gift is mercy.</p>

<p>Daddy and Mommy came to Christ when I was about two&#8230;. I&#8217;m so thankful to have been raised in a Christian family. I love the words to the hymn &#8220;I Know Whom I Have Believed,&#8221; by Daniel W. Whittle: &#8220;I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I&#8217;ve committed unto Him against that day.&#8221;</p>

<p>I really like to write poetry and sometimes stories. Actually, I would probably write a lot more stories if didn&#8217;t get so hung up on research&#8230;. History isn&#8217;t exactly my thing, but I rarely think of stories that can be set in modern times! I also like art; since I&#8217;ve been working on <i>HopeChest</i>, that&#8217;s mostly been applied to doing graphic design.</p>

<p>I like all sorts of sewing and needleworkish things&#8230;&#8203;although I&#8217;m afraid most of my cross-stitches end up buried half-done in my project box in the attic. A friend of mine got me started on crocheting a number of years ago; since then, I&#8217;ve made two baby afghans for my hope chest (or hope drawer, actually&#8212;it currently occupies the bottom drawer of the dresser Fairlight and I share, plus a couple of boxes in the attic). Lately I&#8217;ve been doing some thread crochet, which has turned out to be really fun&#8230;&#8203;I would like such an impractical hobby!</p>

<p>A couple of years ago God provided us with a piano&#8212;a church in town was giving it away&#8212;and with a good friend to give us lessons. I&#8217;ve really been enjoying learning to play it&#8230;&#8203;It&#8217;s an old upright and definitely has its quirks, hence a new hobby&#8212;piano tuning and repair.</p>

<p>Mommy and Daddy have grown vegetables&#8212;and had flower beds in the front yard&#8212;for almost as long as I can remember. I was never very interested in gardening, though, until I studied botany last year and saw for the first time the incredible intricacy of plants&#8230;&#8203;since then I&#8217;ve been hooked. I love flowers and have been exploring the possibility of growing specialty cut flowers on a small scale. This year most of my planning focuses on a small experimental patch of those in the garden. (Two highly-recommended books for the gardeners among you: From <i>Seed to Bloom</i>, by Eileen Powell is a mainstay if you like to start your own plants from seed, and Lynn Byczynski&#8217;s <i>The Flower Farmer</i> is a beautiful book for anyone interested in growing specialty cuts.)</p>

<p>As far as my goals for the future, I want most of all God&#8217;s will for my life&#8230;. I would love for that to include mission work, marrying, and raising children.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Fairlight:</b> My full name is Fairlight Rebecca Meyer, and I&#8217;ll be 21 on March 29&#8230;. Perhaps I could best describe myself by telling you where I&#8217;m most often found: either typing furiously at the computer, or standing in the kitchen swathed in an apron and perusing a cookbook. I love to work with words&#8212;or at least, I love reading about writing and talking about writing, and sometimes even doing it. I spend a lot of time at the computer, whether tinkering with an article for <i>HopeChest</i> (the magazine for Christian young ladies we&#8217;ve been publishing for seven years), writing a letter to one of many wonderful, long-distance friends, or battling through a story or what wants to be a poem.</p>

<p>But when I&#8217;ve gotten thoroughly <i>tired</i> of words and want something more tangible, I abandon the computer for a cookbook. Since I started making some of our family&#8217;s meals a coupl years ago, and discovered just how much I enjoy experimenting in the kitchen, I&#8217;ve been checking out stacks of cookbooks from the library and am forever trying something new.</p>

<p>Besides those things, I very much enjoy sewing&#8212;I was at Mommy&#8217;s elbow, watching her sew, from the time I could toddle, and spent many childhood days outfitting my dolls in motley creations put together from scraps and liberal amounts of stick-on velcro. Over the years I&#8217;ve been hired from time to time to sew for a friend or teach sewing (which was not my strong suit&#8212;I&#8217;m far too prone to say, &#8220;Oh, here, let me just do it!&#8221;); I used to make softsculpture dolls, and I sew some of what I wear; but baby clothes are really my favorites to dream up and put together. We all like to do things with our hands, so I&#8217;ve dabbled in most arts and crafts at one point or another&#8212;but they seldom fit into the schedule now except right before Christmas, when I take to frantically basket-weaving or wreath-making, cross-stitching or miniature-making or some such, for gifts.</p>

<p>Mommy&#8217;s read aloud to us at night for as long as I can remember, and so I&#8217;ve loved to read since I learned how. A mixed blessing&#8212;(I also wasted great quantities of my childhood buried in pulp fiction.) I appreciate Amy Carmichael&#8217;s depth and poetry, Elisabeth Elliot&#8217;s clarity and insight, A. W. Tozer&#8217;s crispness and vision, and Elizabeth Prentiss&#8217;s reality and encouragement&#8230;. How grateful I am for writings like theirs to help lift my eyes to things above when my vision has gotten so muddied by tangled thoughts and feelings and problems!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m 5&#8217;4&#8221; or so, and get my looks from my daddy&#8217;s German ancestry, with long, very straight, brown hair that I wear up and hazel eyes framed by wire-rimmed glasses. My spiritual gift is exhorting, and I tend to be reserved, perfectionist, orderly, and intense. I revel in long conversations, brilliant fall days, reason, beautiful things, productivity, and babies to cuddle.</p>

<p>I can see myself spending my future either as a wife and mother or tending orphans in some foreign country, and writing while I do either thing, but I really don&#8217;t know yet what the Lord has in store. He has been teaching me more and more these past few years that what I really need isn&#8217;t to know my next steps or be able to see the reasons for His plan, as much as I long for those sometimes. What I <i>really</i> need is an overpowering love for Him and great trust in His will&#8212;that my every heart-beat, every breath, every action is for Him and not for myself. How pitifully far I am from this yet! I get so distracted by other things, so impatient, so cold sometimes&#8230;&#8203;but <span class="scripture">&#8220;let us lift up our hearts with our hands unto God in the heavens.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Lamentations+3%3A41" title="Lamentations 3:41"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Lamentations 3:41)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+55%3A2" title="Isaiah 55:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 55:2)</span></a></span> I&#8217;m slowly beginning to see the incredible value of what He offers: for our surrender of the dross so dear to us, He promises His gold&#8212;the treasure of Him who is All in All, Him Without Whom Is Nothing. <span class="scripture">&#8220;O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land&#8230;. Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+63%3A1%2C3" title="Psalm 63:1,3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 63:1,3)</span></a></span></p>

<h2>Please tell us about your family.</h2>
<p class="noindent"><b>Both:</b> Daddy (Edwin Walter Meyer III really, but no one ever calls him that&#8212;just &#8220;Ed&#8221;!) was a builder when we were little, an aircraft mechanic for most of our growing-up years, and is now back to building, running his own remodeling business since his employer closed their base here last spring. Daddy&#8217;s a quiet man with a host of practical skills, and can fix almost anything, it seems&#8230;. He plays the guitar, likes chocolate pudding, gliders, and sail-boats, is a trustee and teaches children&#8217;s church at our church. Daddy was born in eastern Pennsylvania, the second of four children, but spent most of his childhood near Seattle. He and Mommy met in a health-food store in New Hampshire where they both worked, and came to know the Lord years later when we lived in North Carolina.</p>

<p>Mommy (n&eacute;e Vicki Ann Goff) spent her first four years in Chile, where her father was an engineer. Since her mother suffered from altitude sickness, Mommy spent that time in the care of a Chilean woman, and so spoke only Spanish until her parents got divorced and she returned with her mother to their native South Carolina. There she forgot all her Spanish and spent her childhood stirring up rattlesnake nests with her cousins&#8230;. Her days are filled now with the myriad activities of a homemaker&#8212;ranging from cooking and cleaning to tending farm animals to chasing toddlers and listening to all her older children&#8217;s problems. (What would we ever do without a mother?) Mommy&#8217;s an expert on just about everything Daddy isn&#8217;t, and is famous in our family for what she calls her eight-track mind, evidenced by her interrupting herself frequently to think aloud about something entirely different&#8212;&#8220;I heard the strangest thing on the news today,&#8221; or, &#8220;Claire, did you ever water your drachena?&#8221; Mommy coordinates a bulk food co-op, so every couple of months we have fun sorting out an order that includes everything from brown rice to gourmet jelly beans.</p>

<p>Phil (27) is the eldest in our family, married to Elizabeth (23), and living in Massachusetts, where he teaches sociology at several colleges, and she&#8217;s a social worker at a nursing home. As they come to mind, please pray for Phil and Liz and for our relationship with them! They don&#8217;t profess Christ and aren&#8217;t very open to our faith&#8230;. Those of you with beloved family members who aren&#8217;t believers probably well know the tears this has cost us, and how much we long for the kind of closeness with them that can only come through a common love for Christ. How He has used our relationship with them to refine us and open our eyes to un-Christlike attitudes we never knew we fostered, to test our convictions and make us long to reflect Him rightly to those around us!</p>

<p>Eli (23) is in his first year of graduate school at University of Southern California, studying and teaching marine biology, which he adores. Aside from the world below water, Eli&#8217;s passions are art, gourmet cooking, and guitar. Temperamentally he&#8217;s very much like Daddy and he excels in whatever he puts his hand to&#8212;Mommy&#8217;s often called him her Renaissance Man.</p>

<p>Daniel (18) was delighted to bid his schooling goodbye last year&#8212;his heart has always been outdoors with his animals and hunting and woods-wandering. He&#8217;s working with Daddy, which they both seem to enjoy&#8230;. Besides the outdoors Daniel thrives on people, and spends his hours off work visiting and helping neighboring farmers, going to livestock auctions, and waiting for a call to a fire or crash (he&#8217;s a volunteer firefighter). After Claire&#8217;s birth Daddy and Mommy decided five children was probably enough&#8230;&#8203;but over the years the Lord changed their hearts and gave our whole family a great longing for more little ones, little ones who wouldn&#8217;t go home every evening and weekend like Mommy&#8217;s babysitting children did. We knocked on many doors with no success&#8212;until early in 1995, when a Chicago adoption agency we had contacted called. &#8220;Can you fax us your home study? We have a couple of situations coming up&#8230;.&#8221; For the next weeks we jumped every time the phone rang. Would this be The Call? Somehow we managed to endure the wait until that never-to-be-forgotten phone call when they offered us a tiny baby boy&#8212;and the weeks after that while the interstate adoption paperwork went through, and we hadn&#8217;t even gotten to see a picture of our baby yet! Somehow right up to the end it seemed impossible that what we&#8217;d prayed for daily for about five years would actually be coming to pass. But one beautiful Monday evening in late May, we got to meet Mommy and Daddy at the airport as they stepped off the jet-way with a blanketwrapped bundle, and we became utterly oblivious to everything else in drinking up with our eyes the perfect little stranger we had already fallen in love with&#8230;&#8203;and rejoiced and thanked God every time we looked at sweet Samuel Jesse for months.</p>

<p>Samuel will be four this March. Our &#8220;special-needs&#8221; baby who was born weighing only 3 pounds 11 ounces, and was twice hospitalized for breathing problems before he came to us, has grown up into a lively little boy with a million questions and great aspirations toward leadership. He has a passion for details and truth, fire trucks and tea parties, ball games and chewing gum.</p>

<p>Remembering how long it had taken to get Samuel, we found a social worker for our next adoption right after his first birthday&#8230;&#8203;and were shocked when two weeks later she told us her agency had a baby girl we might be interested in! Our faithful social worker suffered through near-daily phone calls from us for the next two weeks, and stayed up until eleven working on our revised home study the last night so that we could have our baby in time for Mother&#8217;s Day. When not on the phone with her, we haunted yard sales for baby-girl clothes and dreamed over the photos we&#8217;d been given. It was early on a Friday afternoon in May when our social worker and her husband pulled up in front of our house and we swarmed out to meet 6-week-old Hannah Grace&#8230;&#8203;Hannah, who just blinked at us in confusion for two weeks till she knew her new family, then blossomed into the vibrant, almost-three-year-old fireball who runs all over our house now&#8212;singing (amazingly tunefully, but with whatever words come to mind), getting into mischief, trying to help with whatever cooking is going on, or cuddling one of her beloved ratty flannel bunnies and sucking her thumb.</p>

<p>We live on 20 acres near Roanoke, Virginia, with a big red barn, little white house, and a varying collection of animals. One of its best and worst features is the creek running through ite&#8230;&#8203;Best because we love to cool off in it during the summer, worst because it floods over most of our land about four times a year. We moved here from the Pittsburgh area in June of 1995.</p>

<p class="hedaing">Is there any special blessing from the Lord you&#8217;d like to share?</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Claire:</b> One thing He&#8217;s made me most thankful/or is His divine engineering of my life (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A28">Romans 8:28</a>). As I look back on my life so far&#8212;but especially the almost-three years we&#8217;ve been living here&#8212;I see so many paths I wouldn&#8217;t have chosen if it were up to me to map each detail of my life&#8230;&#8203;but, even with the finite number of reasons I can see, I am so thankful that He chose them for me.</p>

<p>I guess that reminds me that none of the things I smugly think of as &#8220;my accomplishments&#8221; are mine either&#8230;. God has given not only all the ability, all the opportunity, but all the desire, <span class="scripture">&#8220;for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+2%3A13" title="Philippians 2:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 2:13)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New American Standard Bible">NASB</span> It is so comforting, so humbling, to realize that there is a God who is at work in me.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Fairlight:</b> Undoubtedly two of the greatest blessings the Lord has given me have been my family and my friends, both far-away and nearby. Somehow I suspect I&#8217;m far more prone to express appreciation for my friends&#8217; long, encouraging letters and my siblings&#8217; cheer than my parents, though&#8230;. As we get older and start trying to figure out how we would manage home and family, it&#8217;s so easy to criticize things our parents have done. Yet since God gave us Samuel and Hannah I&#8217;ve been seeing firsthand just how much self-sacrifice and hard work child-rearing involves, and how gladly my parents give it. How much of the richness of my life do I owe to their unceasing efforts (not to mention allowing me to come into the world in the first place)? How much of all that I&#8217;ve learned and done and experienced do I owe to their prayer, their instruction, their not-always-welcome-at-the-time challenges? Thank you, Daddy and Mommy, for everything.</p>

<h2>Would you mind sharing a favorite book, poem, or recipe?</h2>
<p class="noindent"><b>Fairlight:</b> The difficulty will be in deciding which ones! I mentioned some of my favorite inspirational authors above, but I didn&#8217;t tell you about some other books I&#8217;ve been enjoying lately&#8212;Marion Cunningham&#8217;s cookbooks. She edited and revised <i>The Fanny Farmer Cookbook</i>, then compiled <i>The Fanny Farmer Baking Book</i>, <i>The Breakfast Book</i>, and <i>The Supper Book</i>. We&#8217;ve had all four out of the library, and I&#8217;ve had great fun exploring their contents and testing out recipes&#8230;. Unusually enough, all the ones we&#8217;ve tried have worked! She doesn&#8217;t seem to be overly concerned with raising fiber content and lowering fats and sugars, but her recipes are tasty and we&#8217;ve substituted our freshly-ground Golden 86 flour for her all-purpose flour quite successfully.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know how I could ever choose a favorite poem, but I&#8217;ll go for one that you won&#8217;t have to get permission to reprint, and share the words to one of the hymns I&#8217;ve really appreciated:</p>

<p class="verse">Make me a captive, Lord, and then I shall be free.
<br />Force me to render up my sword, and I shall conqueror be.
<br />I sink in life’s alarms when by myself I stand;
<br />Imprison me within Thine arms, and strong shall be my hand.</p>

<p class="verse">My heart is weak and poor until it master find;
<br />It has no spring of action sure, it varies with the wind.
<br />It cannot freely move till Thou has wrought its chain;
<br />Enslave it with Thy matchless love, and deathless it shall reign.</p>

<p class="verse">My power is faint and low till I have learned to serve;
<br />It lacks the needed fire to glow, it lacks the breeze to nerve.
<br />It cannot drive the world until itself be driven;
<br />Its flag can only be unfurled when Thou shalt breathe from heaven.</p>

<p class="verse">My will is not my own till Thou hast made it Thine;
<br />If it would reach a monarch’s throne, it must its crown resign.
<br />It only stands unbent amid the clashing strife,
<br />When on Thy bosom it has leant, and found in Thee its life.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8212;George Matheson</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Claire:</b> Where do I start?!</p>

<p>Two of my favorite books are <i>God&#8217;s Smuggler</i>, by Brother Andrew, and <i>The Family Nobody Wanted</i>, by Helen Doss. I smile as I type this, thinking of what very different books they are: the first the adventure of a Dutchman smuggling Bibles and encouragement to Christians behind the Iron Curtain, the second the story of a minister and his wife and the twelve children they adopted. In a way, though, I guess they aren&#8217;t that different, because both of them are true stories of radical faith&#8230;&#8203;the kind of faith and vision that makes people live a different kind of life. That&#8217;s what I want most of all.</p>

<p>As for a recipe&#8230;. We&#8217;ve made the following cookies several times; they turn out chewy and chocolatey and have a unique taste.</p>

<h3>Chocolate-Cinnamon Crisscrosses</h3>
<ul class="recipe">
<li>1/2 c. butter or margarine</li>

<li>1 c. granulated sugar</li>

<li>2 eggs</li>

<li>1 t. vanilla</li>

<li>1/2 t. cinnamon</li>

<li>2 t. baking powder</li>

<li>2 1/4 c. all-purpose flour</li>

<li>4 oz. semisweet chocolate, melted and cooled</li>

<li>granulated sugar</li>

</ul>
<p>In a large mixing bowl beat the butter with an electric mixer on medium to high speed until softened. Add the 1 c. sugar, baking powder, and cinnamon and beat until combined. Beat in the melted chocolate, eggs, and vanilla. Beat in as much oftheflouras you can with the mixer. Using a wooden spoon, stir in any remaining flour. Cover and chill the dough for 1 to 2 hours or until easy to handle. Shape dough into 1&#8221; balls. Place 2&#8221; apart on an ungreased cookie sheet. Using the tines of fork dipped in additional sugar, flatten balls to about 1/2&#8221; thickness by pressing the fork in 2 directions to form crisscross marks. Bake in a 375&deg; oven for 8 to 10 minutes or until edges are set. Cool on cookie sheet for 1 minute. Remove cookies from cookie sheet and cool on a wire rack. Place in an airtight container and store at room temperature for up to three days. Makes about 48. (From the <i>Better Homes and Gardens Complete Book of Baking</i>)</p>

<h2>In conclusion, is there anything else you&#8217;d like to add?</h2>
<p class="noindent"><b>Fairlight:</b> I know that many of you, like us, tend to find more fellowship faraway than nearby, and it&#8217;s easy to get discouraged and lose your vision for why you live differently, with most of your encouragement coming from such a long distance. Lately the Lord has been impressing on me just how important the little choices we make are&#8212;how everything we do will either make us more like Christ, strengthening us in our walk with Him and our testimony to others&#8230;&#8203;or they will be what Amy Carmichael terms, &#8220;subtle love of softening things, easy choices, weakenings,&#8221; that make it so much more difficult for us to walk with Him, more likely to succumb to temptations and compromises. Don&#8217;t we want His best? Isn&#8217;t what He can give us more valuable than anything else we could seek after? But it&#8217;s so easy to defeat ourselves and our witness through soft compromises with selfishness and worldliness! Please, let&#8217;s continue seeking His will and His ways eagerly, even zealously&#8230;. <span class="scripture">&#8220;For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+64%3A4" title="Isaiah 64:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 64:4)</span></a></span></p>
