<h1><i>Dear Princess Magazine</i></h1>

<p><i>Dear Princess</i> is a quarterly publication for girls of all ages, who are striving to live holy lives and please their Heavenly Father in all areas of their lives.</p>

<p>With the spirit of the world capturing many young lives, while the old paths are being forsaken for feminism and careers and worldliness, we are striving to print Biblical truth to stir and encourage young ladies into seeking to be holy, set apart, keepers at home, and godly young women.</p>

<p>It was with this burden that Abigail Spinks, in the fall of 1996, started <i>Dear Princess</i> with a vision to hold up a higher standard. As Paul gave instruction to Timothy to <span class="scripture">&#8220;Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A22" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 2:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 2:22)</span></a></span> likewise we desire to uphold Bibblcal truth and encourage young ladies in not only learning their homemaking skills, but what will help them in becoming <i>spiritually prepared</i> for their futures.</p>

<p>In January 1998, Abigail asked Skye Erickson to join her in the work as co-editor. And now, together, we are striving to glorify God through this ministry that He has placed in our hands.</p>

<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
<p>Abigail: My family consists of my parents, Mark and Elois, Coquetta Sue (18), and myself, Abigail (14). Daddy and Mama have homeschooled Coquetta and me all our lives, and we are thankful for the Lord giving us godly parents who want to serve the Lord with all their hearts. We live on a small acreage three miles out of the little town of Jefferson. We are grateful for the Lord giving us this place!</p>

<p>Skye: A little over three years ago I (now 17) came to live with Uncle Rick, Aunt Krista, and my four cousins: Laura (18), Joel (16), Kara (14), and Amanda (6). We live here in the beautiful Willamette Valley, on four acres of land.</p>

<p>Both families are heavily involved in <i>Dear Princess</i>, and we appreciate their wisdom and help very much!</p>

<h2>When You Write</h2>
<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+27%3A17" title="Proverbs 27:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 27:17)</span></a></span></p>

<p><i>Dear Princess</i> is written mainly by its readers, and we need your help to encourage others. As readers, you have the opportunity to encourage, challenge, and strengthen your other sisters in becoming more like Christ. Is there a lesson God has been teaching you lately, that you think others would benefit from? Is there a homemaking skill that has been hard for you in the past, but that you&#8217;ve found shortcuts to make the process easier? Has the Lord answered your prayers by helping you to be more patient with your siblings? Please share, and by so doing,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;let us consider one another to provoke [stir up, spur] unto love and to good works.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A24" title="Hebrews 10:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 10:24)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>In future issues, we would like to see more writings from <b>mothers, grandmothers, and older sisters.</b> Please feel free to share with us&#8212;you are very welcome to write in to encourage and teach us younger women.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness&#8230;&#8203;That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+2%3A3-5" title="Titus 2:3-5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Titus 2:3-5)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Again, we can&#8217;t tell you how much each of your letters mean to us&#8212;thank you and please keep writing; they are a great source of encouragement to us. Keep in mind that we consider your letters for print, so please state in your letter if you wish for it not to be printed.</p>

<h1>Notes</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>If you are new to the pages of <i>Dear Princess</i>, or simply want to know, we wanted to meniton that the contents of this issue are not in the normal scheme of things. Devoted mostly to dress and outward/inward modesty, this issue is directed more to young ladies&#8217; outward appearance than charcter building, holy living, and truly a love for our Father, the King. In our previous issues, we usally haven&#8217;t focused so heavily on one specific topic, but have tried to have a variety of articles.</p>

<p>The discussion was not prompted by any one person, or specifically targeted at some particular person, but because we&#8217;ve seen many of our readership questioning and pondering about modesty. We pray the different contributitons and insights will spur you on to seek the Lord and search His Word for the answers.</p>

<p>&#8212;Skye and Abigail</p>

<h1>With Love, from the Editresses</h1>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A24-26" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 2:24-26"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 2:24-26)</span></a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>Rather than an editorial this time, I want to write, by way of an introduction, about this issue&#8217;s topic on modesty.</p>

<p>When setting up, thinking, and praying about this discussion, the above verse has struck me forcibly about the importance of keeping from strife, as servants of the most high God. Who will we reflect if we defensively and close-mindedly bring up our points, without the fear of the Lord on us? In contrast, picture someone who meekly, but firmly, presents their testimony&#8212;who do they represent?</p>

<p>I am grateful for the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness and mercy in burdening sisters to write&#8212;in the fear of the Lord&#8212;with meek and gentle hearts, and I pray for the Lord to stir hearts to seek Him in this area of dress. (I want to note here that I don&#8217;t mean to encourage independent spirits, but the contrary&#8212;dependent spirits&#8212;seeking the guidance and wisdom of your parents and the Lord with open hearts.)</p>

<p>I recently read and typed up a little excerpt for a friend from the book <a href="../../../texts/Helps_to_Holy_Living/index.html" title="Helps to Holy Living">Helps to Holy Living</a>, by C. E. Orr, which I would like to pass on to you, too.</p>

<blockquote>
<h2>The Opened Eye</h2>
<div class="blurb"><p class="first"><span class="scripture">&#8220;Open thou mine eyes.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+119%3A18" title="Psalm 119:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 119:18)</span></a></span></p>
</div>


<p>Who among us does not need to pray this prayer? Who among us has an eye to see all that belongs to the Christian life? Are there not yet some glorious things lying out beyond the boundary of our vision? Oh, for the open eye to see the wondrous things God has prepared for them that love Him! Out beyond our spiritual horizon there may be blessed realities awaiting us if we would but seek God earnestly for the open eye to discover them. This world has been called a vale of tears, a wilderness of woe, and man&#8217;s way through it a way of trouble and sorrow, yet there is a way running through it which is a way of pleasantness, and a path which is a pathway of peace. We need the open eye to find this heavenly way. If man would but rise to the fullness of life, he would find many glorious things awaiting him there. Up in the higher realms of close companionship with God there is fullness of joy. If man would come into such intimacy with God as to read His mind and know the loving thoughts He has toward him, his joy would be complete. If man could but see all that lies in the fatherhood of God, he would never have a care.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>There are many things God has for His children&#8212;many precious lessons to teach each one of us. However, except the Lord build our house, we will labor in vain; except the Lord open our eyes to spiritual truths, we won&#8217;t comprehend the full meaning of His words in His blessed book.</p>

<p>I remember an incident that happened not too long ago, which shows how easy it is to lean on our own understanding&#8212;perhaps with good intentions, but still our own human understanding.</p>

<p>Not too long ago, there was a writing contest which I had plans to enter, only I didn&#8217;t think it was really like a contest. In my mind, I had thought it was just a way to encourage others in the Lord, and if you won, receiving a little gift of thanks.</p>

<p>Talking with Uncle Rick, he gave me his thoughts and encouraged me to pray, leaving the decision between myself and the Lord. He wanted me to seek the Lord for myself and prayed for the Lord to show me what was right, what I should do.</p>

<p>Had my heart been closed and my ideas about the contest all ready firm and concluded, I would have erred in thinking that God approved of my thoughts. But praise the Lord for His faithfulness and answers to our prayers to show us His mind in the matter.</p>

<p>The Lord shortly thereafter confirmed both through Uncle Rick and others and by scripture, which clearly showed that I shouldn&#8217;t write. He opened my eyes and gave me understanding because my heart was open to His Word and desired His will.</p>

<p>Girls, I just pray that each one of us would beseech the Lord to open our eyes. Perhaps you&#8217;ve assumed, as I did, or you&#8217;ve been groping about blindly searching for the truth, wearing dresses because you&#8217;ve been influenced by those who wear them, yet without having the personal conviction in your hearts.</p>

<p>Pray, dear girls, and ask the Lord to open you and your family&#8217;s hearts to hear the voice of the Lord in not just this area, but in all areas. Does your life evidently bespeak of a holy, consecrated life before God? Does your life, convictions, and walk mirror Jesus and the teachings of His book?</p>

<p>I was reflecting the other day, as we walked in and out of a Bible book house, how sad it is to see so many profess Christianity, yet their lives show evidence of walking after the desires of the flesh.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t cling to your own understanding; don&#8217;t cling to any other idol or object or idea, for our own understanding is far from perfect and we&#8217;re so prone to go off on tangents, blindly seeking our own way. When we let go and just give all to the Lord, He begins and will be faithful to open your eyes and understanding. It is dangerous for your souls to believe in any other gospel than those that are backed by the Word of God.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A15" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 2:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 2:15)</span></a></span></p>

<p>To close this brief letter, I&#8217;d like to end with a favorite song, which echoes the prayer of my heart.</p>

<p class="verse">With Thine eye, O Savior, guide me<br />Through my pilgrimage below;<br />In Thy secret presence hide me,<br />On my heart Thy grace bestow.</p>

<p class="verse">Guide my thoughts lest they should wander<br />To the empty dreams of earth;<br />Let me on Thy goodness ponder,<br />Yea, on things of heavenly worth.</p>

<p class="verse">Guide my actions, O my Father,<br />Guide my soul to heaven&#8217;s shore;<br />Thee I&#8217;ll follow and no other,<br />Be my guide for evermore.<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Guide_Me/index.html" title="Guide Me">*</a></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>Greetings to each one of you in the precious name of our Lord! As I was pondering what to write at this season to send to you, the Lord began to speak to me about how important it is to be led by the Holy Spirit in all our actions. Please notice that I did not say, &#8220;the spirit,&#8221; but the <i>Holy</i> Spirit. There are many different spirits floating around, and most definitely, not all are the Holy Spirit, who alone should guide the lives of the Most High King&#8217;s daughter. As children of the Lord, we should have one spirit ruling foremost in our lives. That Holy Spirit brings in other graces that bear the fruit of righteousness in our lives as we allow Him to guide and work in us. But before I go any farther, I&#8217;d like to say that if I you are thinking, &#8220;Why is she writing about this subject?&#8212;it is too far beyond us simple princesses. I can&#8217;t know and recognize the Holy Spirit in the every day-to-day life&#8212;that is something beyond the common Christian experience.&#8221; But, dear sister, you must. I thought the same thing you are thinking&#8212;that it was beyond me to know the ways of how the Holy Spirit works and to be guided by Him in such a way that we know without a shadow of a doubt that we are being led by the Lord. But it is not only our privilege to know, dear sister, <b>it is vital to our Christian experience</b> to know how the Holy Spirit leads (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A14">Romans 8:14</a>). If we do not know, we can easily be led astray by another spirit. An incident happened to me once that I am ashamed of, but it is something that helped me to see the importance of knowing how the Holy Spirit works, and its fruits (i.e., cheerfulness, modesty, longsuffering, etc.), which He brings into our hearts and guards us from other spirits not of God.</p>

<p>One morning, I was struggling with my fairly long hair, trying to get it up neatly, nicely and reasonably comfortably as the Lord had been showing me. I was more than willing to follow what the Lord wanted me to do, but oh, how deceitfully the devil works, and I was not on guard as I should have been. A friend was watching me and was trying to give helpful hints, and I did not realize that this individual had not been living as close to the Lord as they could have been and had some ideas of hair arranging that did not glorify the Lord and was self-exalting and would draw attention to self. Her spirit was not the humble, meek and quiet spirit that I was seeking for in putting up my hair in simple fashion so that any natural attraction would be out of the way and the Lord could shine through. She was older than I and had put up her hair for years, so I listened to her tips and did not catch the worldly bent in her words. Before I knew what was happening, hair curlers and other things were being placed in my hair and I was beginning to look like I had come from a beauty parlor. Naturally, I, like most anyone else, do enjoy looking nice, and I began to lose sight of why I was putting up my hair and what the Holy Spirit had been teaching me. Pride began to seep in and I began to battle the prideful spirit that tried to seize hold of me. <i>It looks nice. It&#8217;s okay&#8212;you&#8217;re still putting it up. You didn&#8217;t do it yourself&#8212;someone else did it on you. You should make yourself look as nice as you can,</i> etc. Another spirit besides the Holy Spirit was trying to guide me, and I did struggle to let go of &#8220;making myself look nicer.&#8221;</p>

<p>That incident stamped into my mind how important it is that we stay in close communion with the Lord so that we have His spirit guiding us every hour of the day. We must not get something from God and then think, &#8220;Well, I know what He wants me to do, I guess I can relax now and obey this until He shows me something else.&#8221; If you do that, you can be sure the devil will pounce on you in your time of relaxation. The devil does not sleep, he does not rest; he is always roaming about seeking whom he may devour. If you allow yourself to get a little out of tune with the Lord, you put yourself in a <i>very</i> dangerous place. It is important for us to keep up-to-date with the Lord at all times and at <i>all</i> times seeking Him for our everyday needs.</p>

<p>The Lord began to speak to me there while I faced the mirror, looking at what my friend was doing to my hair. The Lord said, &#8220;This is not acceptable. How can I shine through you like this?&#8221; I asked for grace for me to humble myself in my heart and take down what my friend had done and do my hair in a simple way that pleased Him. Thank the Lord, God always extends grace to His trusting children when they meet His conditions. I&#8217;ve thought since then, what if I had run over the voice of the Holy Spirit and gone on with my hair in that worldly fashion that displeased the Lord? What if I had said, &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t really matter,&#8221; and pushed away my uncomfortable feelings toward the manner of arrangement? Dear girls, if I had done such a thing, it would have been very detrimental to my walk with the Lord. You say, &#8220;But it was such a little thing! How can that be detrimental to a walk with the Lord?&#8221; It is the little foxes that spoil the vines, girls, and little things lead to big things. The next time I would be faced with some situation where I could either obey the voice of the Holy Spirit or disregard its leadings, it would be harder to hear the voice and easier to push it away and go on. Eventually the Holy Spirit would he forced to leave&#8212;He will not abide in a place where He is not Ruler of all. How important it is to listen and keep in tune with the Holy Spirit!</p>

<p>Oh, dear sisters, let us set our wills to be guided by the Holy Spirit&#8212;we cannot afford to not be guided by Him. Let us seek the throne of grace to be filled with the Holy Spirit and have Him be our guide. Until we do, other spirits will be constantly taking the Holy Spirit&#8217;s place, and things will come out of your life that you did not know were there. It could be pride, it could be wrath, it could be impurity, it could be impatience; I don&#8217;t know what your problem may be. But I do know some of how important it is that we be filled with the Holy Spirit and guided by Him so that these things do not have opportunity to guide us.</p>

<p>There could be much more written on the Holy Spirit and its importance, but my thoughts are wandering towards the planned discussion on modesty&#8212;the dresses/pants question. How important it is to be guided by the Lord in this area of our lives. It may seem not so important, but it is. You may say, &#8220;That is just her opinion.&#8221; Oh, please do not take it so lightly! What shows on the outside is reflecting the inside. Would you please read with an open heart and then spend some time communing with the Holy Spirit and listen to what He has to say? We are praying earnestly that you will desire all God has for you, that you will be open in all areas to what the Holy Spirit wants to tell you and that you will come closer to the Lord in your journey together.</p>

<p>&#8212;Abigail</p>

<h2>The Motive Behind Our Clothing</h2>
<p>By writing this, I am not trying to change your personal convictions, tell you that ours is better than yours, or sow discord among us (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+6%3A19">Proverbs 6:19</a>). Though many of you will probably not agree with everything I say here, I really feel that the issue of dresses vs. slacks is so unimportant compared to all the other issues in life. Instead, I believe it is the motive behind our dress that is important.</p>

<p>We do wear slacks on a regular basis; my parents don&#8217;t see anything wrong with it, and for me they are more comfortable. Slacks can be more modest during activities such as horseback riding, exercising, skiing, sports, or outdoors on windy days. We make sure our slacks aren&#8217;t too tight or too loose. We always wear dresses or skirts to church and music lessons or other such occasions. It denotes respect. I believe that the head of the home chooses how his family should dress.</p>

<p>Jesus rarely mentioned raiment in His earthly ministry. Why? He wanted to change the spiritual lives of people. As Christians, we can very easily argue about what we believe is right or wrong. I recall a time when I was at a week-long seminar in Tennessee. We had just arrived, and I was in slacks. Dad, my sister, and I went for a walk and decided to go into the main building. While in there, a girl passed me and wrinkled her nose at the sight of me in slacks. She probably didn&#8217;t realize it, but she was judging by appearance. Once I heard someone (I don&#8217;t remember who) say that when we get to heaven, there will be a sign before us that reads, &#8220;They Would Have Known You Were Christians If You Loved.&#8221; Do we judge others because of how they look? Do we wear clothing to look outwardly &#8220;holy&#8221;? Should we spend our whole lives arguing dress?</p>

<p>When we all get to heaven, God is going to commend us for our spiritual lives and deeds. There is no reward for an argumentative spirit. To sum up my views on dresses vs. slacks, I would say that clothing choice must be based on your personal walk with God and the choices your parents have made.</p>

<h2>What Should Our Focus Be?</h2>
<p class="noindent">Dear Princesses,</p>

<p>I would like to share briefly some things I have learned during five years of exploring the issue of modest dress&#8230;.</p>

<p>My mother and I first were introduced to this idea after reading the testimonies and convictions of other ladies in a Christian magazine. We quickly saw the truth that was taught in the Scriptures, once our attention was drawn to it. We readily embraced that we needed to wear dresses all the time, and soon I made the complete change.</p>

<p>During the years following, I spent more time and thought than ever in my life on what I was going to wear. Dresses are expensive if you buy very many, so we made everything ourselves. I always was behind with something to sew; but since everyone else we knew who wore dresses was too, I thought nothing of it&#8212;this was just what being modest required. To sum it up, I completely missed the point. I was quite modest as far as the cut of my clothes, but of (what I thought was) necessity, I was completely preoccupied with dressing. Instead of now being free of the slave of fashion, I was spending more time than ever with my dress. I thought modesty meant basically the cut of your clothes, and since you can&#8217;t wear the same dress day after day and not have it look repetitive, (like you can with jeans), you must therefore have quite a variety, a new dress every day of the week. This translates into a lot of sewing, especially when the season changes. I did not then realize that also of great importance should be not taking thought for what we should wear&#8212;to have inward humility which would cause us not to dress in a prideful or revealing way. It always troubled me that I knew of Christian women who wore jeans and they were always feminine, modest in their actions and posture, in no way drawing attention to themselves. One family in particular I always felt like such a hypocrite around&#8212;the girls and the mother were of such a sweet Christian spirit; I have never felt &#8220;looked down upon&#8221; or &#8220;odd&#8221; around them&#8212;they seem to possess a truly humble spirit. At times I knew in my heart who was truly of a modest spirit and was least concerned with their appearance! (And it wasn&#8217;t be-jumpered me!) Outward modesty should be the natural by-product of an inward humility and desire not to draw attention to oneself. I did not have this change of heart, therefore changing my dress profited me nothing! The author of a commentary on 1st Peter [<i>An Obedient and Patient Faith</i>, by Robert Leighton, available from Calvary Press, (800) 789-8175], written during the 1600&#8217;s, expresses it more clearly than I can:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">It is as sure as any of these, that real excess and vanity in apparel will creep in, and will always willingly convey itself under the cloak of some of these honest and lawful considerations. This is a prime piece of our heart&#8217;s deceit, not only to hold out fair pretenses to others, but to put the trick upon ourselves, to make ourselves believe we are right and single-minded in those things wherein we are directly serving our lusts, and feeding our own vanity.</p>

<p>To a sincere and humble Christian, very little either dispute or discourse concerning this will be needful. A tender conscience, and a heart purified from vanity and weaned from the world, will be sure to regulate this, and all other things of this nature. As conscientious Christians will not exceed in the thing itself so in as far as they use lawful ornament and comeliness they will do it without bestowing much either diligence or delight on the business. To have the mind taken and pleased with such things, is so foolish and childish a thing, that if most might not find it in themselves, they would wonder at it in many others, of years and common sense.</p>

<p>The Apostle doth indeed expressly, on purpose, check and forbid vanity, and excess in apparel, and excessive delight in lawful decorum, but his prime end is to recommend this other ornament of the soul, the hidden man of the heart.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>I wish I had spent five years seeking a meek and quiet spirit, instead of vainly becoming consumed with endless sewing. The problem was not caused by wearing dresses, and that was not wrong, but my focus was wrong. My purpose in sharing my mistakes is to warn others so they will not fall into this trap. Since becoming awakened to the truths above, I have made some changes in my dress. I needed to do whatever would be economical of my time and money, and what would allow me to spend the least time taking thought for what I should wear. I began wearing loose fitting pants and overalls to chore and milk in. What freedom&#8212;no longer do I soil two dresses per day during muddy seasons! It saves on the laundry and wear on my dresses, which I usually change into after chores. But now I am not bound by a certain mode of dress and realize that a meek spirit set on heavenly things will cause us to choose that which is not revealing or expensive, whether it is dresses or pants. I personally am more comfortable in dresses; perhaps from wearing them so long. But now I am perfectly free to accept my sister in jeans without feeling there is a barrier between us.</p>

<p>I have talked to some of my friends who have fallen into the same mistake of being consumed with dressing as I have, so I assume this must be a favorite attack of the adversary. If our heart is not renewed by the Spirit, pride and vanity will simply express themselves in other ways despite outward changes. I am concerned for all the young girls growing up that are being taught that all wearing of pants is unacceptable. Certainly many styles are immodest, as are some dresses, and we should discern that (I have very strict standards for my pants!), but to focus so much on outward appearance seems dangerously to me like having a righteousness of the law, and not of faith. Let&#8217;s not substitute one form of pride for another. If we focus first on a renewed heart, the fruit of God&#8217;s Spirit will be naturally manifest in our lives.</p>

<h2>Lord, Teach Us Your Ways: A Personal Testimony</h2>
<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>The issue of the way we dress has come to my mind much lately and I believe that the Lord would have me write how He dealt with me in this area.</p>

<p>I grew up in a standard, conservative American home where we knew our parents loved us and desired for us to grow up to be loving, kind, and obedient, as well as become productive members of society. We went to church regularly as well as attended Sunday School. I was not supervised as I should have been, and as a consequence I had gone through some very bad experiences. In this way the Lord was able to deal with my soul when quite young. I was gloriously saved when I was nearly eleven years old and peace was brought to my troubled soul. I now abhorred evil communications and I delighted to do all to please God. Most of our training was in the public schools and the influence had a great impact on me, in spite of the fact that I wanted no part of anything that was not pleasing to God.</p>

<p>During my teen years, I grew up going to public schools in Southern California where miniskirts were the rage. Soon pants were being accepted as a means of dress for girls and it was easy for me to make the transition to wearing them. I felt more modest when I wore pants since I often felt very uncomfortable in wearing dresses even though I wore them at a &#8220;conservative length&#8221; of two inches above the knees. My parents had no Biblical understanding that women are not to wear the clothing of men and so I never saw it as an offense to God and enjoyed the freedom of wearing pants.</p>

<p>It was not until nearly ten years ago that I saw dresses in a different light from that of my youth, as women were starting to wear longer dresses. I bought a couple of dresses that were mid-calf length at that time for special occasions, and I no longer felt self conscious in dresses as I previously did. Shortly after that time the Lord brought me in contact with a &#8220;very conservative&#8221; family. The mother and I were visiting one time, and the topic of dress and hair came about in our conversation as I must have mentioned something to my ignorance of these things in regards to the Word of God. In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+2%3A9">I&nbsp;Timothy 2:9</a> it says that women are to adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls or costly array. The Holy Spirit had witnessed these things in my heart, but I&#8217;m afraid that I often gave into the temptation of desiring others to think highly of me. The years of our youth are hard ones to go through without godly instruction and I can say that the training I received was far from godly as my parents didn&#8217;t understand the importance of guiding the heart in attitude as well as deed. I am thankful to say that the Lord has been faithful to my soul, and has helped me out from the pitfalls of Satan that I once so often fell into. I had no idea that God had specific instruction to our dress. <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+22%3A5">Deuteronomy 22:5</a> states that <span class="scripture">&#8220;The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman&#8217;s garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> thy God.&#8221;</span> Here, in God&#8217;s Word, is a shadow and type of the heart covenant that we can now receive through the blood of Jesus. I am reminded here that God made men and women differently and we are blessed when we work under the guidelines that God has put out for us&#8212;both in work and in dress. I had new things to think and ponder about.</p>

<p>It was not long before I put aside my pants. It took longer for me to understand what the Lord required of me in understanding the specifics of all this. As I have prayed about and witnessed the working of the Lord in the liberated heart I see that the specifics in regards to length, color, pattern, etc. are governed under the witness of the Holy Spirit to the individual heart that desires to be taught of God. The Lord will teach us those things that draw those around us into various temptations. This is not easy as we are all individuals, and others may have different convictions than ourselves and may feel free to wear that which you may not feel free to wear or vice versa. Look to the Lord and be taught of Him as to what He requires of you. You need to <i>know</i> that you are clear before God in regards to modesty in dress as well as in heart. The adorning the Lord desires for us to wear is that of the heart, and the outward adorning is to be as not to draw attention to oneself so that others will not be hindered in seeing the life of Christ working in you. I have found that the Lord <i>will</i> help you to do all that He requires of you.</p>

<p>One more thing I would like to remind us about is our garments are used merely to clothe or cover us. As Christians our concern should be focused on serving God <span class="scripture">&#8220;without fear, In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+1%3A74-75" title="Luke 1:74-75"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 1:74-75)</span></a></span> As soon as we understand God&#8217;s standard for us He will help us to measure up in a way that pleases Him. He will help us to put aside our own wishes or desires. We are called to be a vessel of honor and glory&#8212;often in the world we are concerned with our looks and dress to the point of vanity. The Lord gives us a meek and quiet spirit that is content with the necessities of life. I have been content and blessed to have a few garments with sweaters and leggings to help keep warm in colder weather. I wear the same dress throughout the week. I try to make sure to have a garment that is &#8220;new-like&#8221; in the closet to have to wear away from home or when company comes. Most of all I need the Lord&#8217;s help to keep a balanced view of my needs.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;But godliness with contentment is great gain.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+6%3A6" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 6:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 6:6)</span></a></span></p>

<h2>Seeing Christ Through You</h2>
<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters in the Lord,</p>

<p>I would like to share my family&#8217;s opinion on the dresses vs. pants issue.</p>

<p>Our family came to the conclusion that we wear dresses all the time quite a while ago. I remember the time. At first I was actually quite happy about it because I always liked dresses. But soon afterward I thought, &#8220;When I&#8217;m old enough to do as I like, I&#8217;ll wear pants.&#8221; But now as I am older, I feel that I cannot wear anything else but dresses. First of all, I feel that wearing pants brings attention to my figure. Also, when women first began wearing pants, which was at the time of World War II, they were becoming &#8220;working women,&#8221; and it is the husband&#8217;s role to support his family. Our role is not a man&#8217;s role. <span class="scripture">&#8220;But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+11%3A3" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 11:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 11:3)</span></a></span> A scripture that has been special to me is 1 Peter 3:3-4, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A3-4" title="I&nbsp;Peter 3:3-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 3:3-4)</span></a></span> Our ornament is a meek and quiet spirit. All I want the world to see is Christ through me. Modest apparel is fitting for a godly person. <span class="scripture">&#8220;In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+2%3A9-10" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 2:9-10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 2:9-10)</span></a></span> Modesty is more than covering up. It is concealing the body properly. Modesty, according to <i>The American College Dictionary</i> (1958 version), means &#8220;a conformity to propriety and decorum; a becoming shyness, sobriety and proper behavior; quiet simplicity. Distaste for anything coarse or loud; free from vanity, egotism, boastfulness.&#8221; So it means modesty both inside and outside. Inward modesty is important, so is outward modesty. What is in our heart will show. <span class="scripture">&#8220;A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+6%3A45" title="Luke 6:45"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 6:45)</span></a></span> I do not want the world to see my fleshly body; this one that will be exchanged for a heavenly one.</p>

<p>I can very much understand the difficulty of staying covered up. As a small girl it isn&#8217;t so bad to see a dress fly up. But as you grow older it gets worse. With running, I have had to realize that I will not stay a little girl. I&#8217;m growing up, and is it really proper for me to run about, especially outside the family? With riding my bike, I have found bloomers to be very helpful. My little sisters wear bloomers all the time, and so do I, although it is not as important as with the little girls. Full skirts are more modest than straighter ones, and help on a bicycle, also. It is our rule to wear bloomers on the trampoline.</p>

<p>We sew all our clothes. We have a very nice, loose pullover jumper, and another that buttons down the front. Our dresses go near to our ankles, and the full width of the fabric helps to keep us covered when we&#8217;re on the floor with the children, etc. We try to stay simple, and keep the same patterns, especially since there are a lot of girls in our family. We stay away from T-shirts, and make our own blouses, with 3/4-length sleeves with elastic so we&#8217;re able to move freely and not be concerned about showing parts of our body that should be covered. For winter we wear turtlenecks. My mother has one jumper pattern that she has made to a maternity and nursing jumper. It is drop-waisted and very modest (no unbuttoning needed to nurse).</p>

<p>For swimming, which we don&#8217;t really do, but we do go wading, we wear old clothes; and in case you decide to go up to your neck in water, bring an extra change of clothes. We have decided to stay away from swimming pools, not only for our thoughts on dressing but also for our own sakes, because of the dressing of others.</p>

<p>I know the subject was dresses vs. pants but we feel that modesty is for the men an boys, also. We see many times the modesty is carried out in the women and girls, but not in the men. If the women should be modest, how much more so the men, who are the head of the home? He is the example for the whole family. My father is the only man in the family besides my baby brother. He wears long, loose pants and nice shirts (no T-shirts). He never wears shorts, and the pants are so loose he must wear suspenders, because a belt would not look nice, but are not so loose they&#8217;re sloppy. Overalls are very practical for little boys. I would encourage all of you who are studying modesty for women to also do it for the men. It are just as important, and maybe even more so.</p>

<p>May God bless you all as you study this subject out.</p>

<h2>Legalists or Examples?</h2>
<p class="noindent">Dear Girls,</p>

<p>Greeting to you in the name of our dear Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. May God bless you as you and your readers search the Scriptures about this topic. My daughter Elisabeth has already written you with her thoughts (and basically shared our family&#8217;s views on this), so I&#8217;ll not repeat it. I did come across something in my reading yesterday that I thought might be appreciated. Since we do dress very conservatively, many people might consider us &#8220;legalistic&#8221; in this area, though we prefer to just live our lives as examples rather than try to convince with words. When asked, we do share our interpretation of modest dressing. The following is from some writings by a man named H. Foster. He was addressing the issue of legality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Legalists are always occupied with externals. They attach the greatest importance to the niceties of orthodox practice and language as things in themselves. By them the simple practices of the New Testament are made into a ritual. The spirit of a thing is lost sight of in an exaggerated devotion to the thing, whereas to God nothing has value apart from the spiritual truth it is meant to express. Moreover the legalistic mind is always obsessed with deciding what is right and what is wrong. That, after all, is what the law is for! Far be it from us to encourage any laxity in the matter of what is morally right or morally wrong. If however, we make ourselves judges or arbitrators; if we let our relationship with other believers be governed by our own interpretation of what is right and wrong; if, indeed being right, we insist upon our own rights, we have been overtaken by legality.</p>

<h2>Modesty: Representing the King</h2>
<p>My name is Jodie Kooistra and my family is attending a conservative Mennonite church at the present time. All the females in our family wear dresses and I feel that the wearing of dresses is in obedience to Deuteronomy 22:5 which states: <span class="scripture">&#8220;The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman&#8217;s garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> thy God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+22%3A5" title="Deuteronomy 22:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Deuteronomy 22:5)</span></a></span> I believe that this is a very convicting verse as to why women should wear dresses. I have found that I am treated more like a young lady when I am wearing dresses. People are more polite and considerate in their actions and deeds when I am wearing my dresses. I have also found that I watch my speech and the things I think about when I remember who I am representing by wearing my dresses. I truly feel more feminine and like a &#8220;daughter of the King.&#8221;</p>

<p>I truly enjoy playing outside and being very active (i.e., ice skating, baseball, dare base, roller-skating, bike-riding, etc.). I wear shorts underneath my dresses if I feel that need is there. Most of the time I have found that the games and things I enjoy are easily done while still being modest. I can run much easier in dresses than I can in the pants I used to wear.</p>

<p>I have found that there are quite a few very simple but nice-looking dress patterns put out by Simplicity. If you look closely at some catalogs you can find some simple jumpers and turtleneck dresses.</p>

<p>As for tips, I already mentioned wearing shorts while being active. I also think that it helps if you bend at the knees and not at the waist, therefore not letting your dress ride up. Like anything, it will feel strange at first, but eventually you will not be able to stand wearing your binding pants.</p>

<p>I have not really encountered a group swimming event yet, but when my family took a vacation and we stayed in a motel with a pool, we waited until there wasn&#8217;t anyone down there (which was almost all the time) and we went down as a family. I used to be on the swim team and I absolutely <i>adore</i> swimming! Right now I wear a T-shirt over my swimming suit until I can obtain a more modest suit. The one I have right now was my racing suit so it is a bit tight and close. My parents don&#8217;t mind us swimming in our back yard or at a motel but we do not go to public pools.</p>

<p>I hope I have helped you and that these thoughts can encourage and help someone!</p>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">Interjection from Skye: If we are unwilling to wear shorts because they show our legs, is it much better to wear bathing suits? Dear sisters, we swim in dresses and jumpers with bloomers and have no problems. For pactical tips, I have found that dark, heavy-weight jumpers are much more modest, as they don&#8217;t cling to your body as much as light cotton. I wear denim jumpers with a blouse underneath and bloomers. Perhaps some of you might feel a little &#8220;weighed down,&#8221; but you get used to it. We feel comfortable in our modest swimwear and are able to swim easily.</p>

<h2>Are We Stumbling Blocks?</h2>
<p>Modesty is a very important issue, and I feel that we, as daughters of the King, should dress modestly at all times. I started wearing dresses all the time a little over a year ago. I made this change after receiving <i>HopeChest</i> magazine. At first I thought it seemed different that many of the girls I read about wore only dresses, but then the Lord started speaking to my heart&#8212;I started to feel uncomfortable wearing pants in public.</p>

<p>My own reasons for wearing dresses are: it helps me to be more submissive to my parents; it helps me to not fall into the spirit of the world; and, dresses are more modest. In contrast, when wearing pants I seem to have a harder time being obedient, I have a much harder time staying away from the world in my thoughts, and I&#8217;m not as comfortable (modestly) in public.</p>

<p>With a few exceptions, I wear dresses, jumpers, and&#8230;&#8203;skirts all the time. With regard to Micah&#8217;s question about sports, I personally do not exercise much in public, so I just wear a sweat outfit for my exercise at home. When my family and I go bike riding, I wear a split-skirt, or, if the weather is cold, loose pants to stay warm. When going on hikes, skirts can be difficult, so I wear a split-skirt. For swimming, I wear a bathing suit covered by long shorts and a T-shirt. I would like to have something more modest, but since we&#8217;re not real confident sewing on bathing suit fabric, this works for now. (Even a skirt can be immodest in the pool, which is why I feel it is best not to swim when boys are present.) My family and I play tennis sometimes, and that is one sport for which a long dress definitely does not work. For tennis, again a knee-length split-skirt works well.</p>

<p>When I must do something that is much harder to do in a dress, I will wear loose, long pants or loose, long shorts&#8212;but that is seldom anymore.</p>

<p>Where to get dresses&#8230;. As far as catalog shopping goes, some carry modest dresses, but we have found they are usually very expensive. We haven&#8217;t been successful finding dresses at the malls as they do not carry much in the way of modest styles. So last year my mom and I took sewing classes. We usually buy our fabric at Jo-Ann&#8217;s Crafts and Fabrics or Wal-Mart. Our Jo-Ann&#8217;s frequently has patterns on sale for $.99, so you may want to get on the mailing list of a store near you. Wa1-Mart has great fabric prices. Below I have listed a few patterns you might want to look at&#8212;they have worked well for us.</p>

<p>I feel strongly that as Christian young ladies, we are to dress and conduct ourselves so as to not make our brothers in Christ stumble. The Apostle Paul admonishes us to not cause our brothers to stumble or make them weak (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+14%3A21">Romans 14:21</a>). To put it very plainly: what we wear can cause others, as well as ourselves, to fall into sin. Modesty also involves more than just our clothing it also includes our mannerisms and our hearts. We are to keep our hearts <span class="scripture">&#8220;with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+4%3A23" title="Proverbs 4:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 4:23)</span></a></span> As I shared ear1ier, for me, wearing dresses is an added protection for my heart to be obedient.</p>

<p>I was surprised when I was reading the Word in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+22%3A5">Deuteronomy 22:5</a> that it is an &#8220;abomination&#8221; for a woman to dress like a man. Likewise in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Zephaniah+1%3A8">Zephaniah 1:8</a>, the Lord says that He will punish those who are clothed with strange apparel. The Amplified version of that verse explains, <span class="scripture">&#8220;all who are clothed in [lavish] foreign apparel [instead of the Jewish dress, with its reminders to obey God&#8217;s commandments].&#8221;</span> There is a very strong pull in our society today for women to be like men&#8212;independent and bold&#8212;and that is wrong. Dresses are feminine. It is important for us to stay as feminine as possible. Our future husbands (Lord willing) will not want to marry women who are like men. As I mentioned earlier, dresses can help some women walk in obedience&#8212;&#8220;reminders to obey God&#8217;s commandments.&#8221; One lady at a church we once attended said that dresses had helped her to be more submissive to her husband.</p>

<p>Pray and ask the Lord if He would wish you to wear dresses all the time. Of course, ask your parents. Our parents have much wisdom and can discern things that we often can&#8217;t&#8230;. [this] is also something for us to take to the Lord&#8230;.</p>

<p>Butterick 6075 (view &#8220;D&#8221;) is a good split-skirt which has worked very well for us. This pattern also has a nice skirt pattern, which I am working on.</p>

<p>Simplicity 7118 is a nice wrap-around skirt. My Mom and I made view &#8220;B&#8221; of this skirt. If you are a size &#8220;small&#8221; you will want to make this a size &#8220;medium&#8221; anyway because size &#8220;small&#8221; does not wrap around far enough. It can easily blow open. Just place the &#8220;button hole&#8221; on the waist to fit your waist.</p>

<p>Simplicity 8564 is a good basic jumper pattern. (This pattern&#8217;s size only goes up to 14.)</p>

<p>Butterick 4272 is a nice jumper (you can dress it up a little more if you wish). It is more fitted, and I raised the neckline a little. (There is also an adult size of this pattern the number is: Butterick 4250.)</p>

<p>Simplicity 8165 is one that I have not tried yet, but it looks really nice. I&#8217;m thinking of making views &#8220;A&#8221; and &#8220;B.&#8221;</p>

<p>May God bless you dear sisters as you serve Him!</p>

<h2>A Spirit of Modesty</h2>
<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+1%3A5" title="James 1:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 1:5)</span></a></span> Could you pause as you read this and ask the Lord to give you wisdom concerning this subject of modesty? <span class="scripture">&#8220;Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>&#8230;&#8203;and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+2%3A3" title="Isaiah 2:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 2:3)</span></a></span></p>

<p>God asks that we be obedient to His word: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+4%3A9" title="Philippians 4:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 4:9)</span></a></span> What does the word of God say about His desires for us, as His children? There are many principles which we can also apply to our choice of clothing.</p>

<p>1) Holiness. God said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;be ye holy: for I am the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> your God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Leviticus+20%3A7" title="Leviticus 20:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Leviticus 20:7)</span></a></span> The word <i>holy</i> means &#8216;set apart&#8221;. Romans 12 begins with a plea for personal holiness: <span class="scripture">&#8220;I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+12%3A1-2" title="Romans 12:1-2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 12:1-2)</span></a></span> By not being &#8220;conformed to this world&#8221; we should live a life set apart for God: a life of holiness.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+1%3A15" title="I&nbsp;Peter 1:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 1:15)</span></a></span> The Greek word translated &#8220;conversation&#8221; doesn&#8217;t just mean the words you speak. This verse could also be interpreted, &#8220;be ye holy in all manner of living, in your conduct, behavior, in every aspect of life.&#8221; We should consider our clothing in this light, then. Is it, &#8220;set apart&#8221; from the world?</p>

<p>2) Purity. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+5%3A8" title="Matthew 5:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 5:8)</span></a></span> One definition of purity is: free from anything that taints or impairs, clear, simple, faultless, free from sin or guilt; blameless. The word <i>chaste</i> is a synonym for purity. It means: decent, or modest in nature and behavior, restrained and simple in style; not ornate.</p>

<p>The person who has a &#8220;pure heart&#8221; will not act or dress in a way that causes a brother or sister in Christ to sin. <span class="scripture">&#8220;That no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother&#8217;s way&#8230;. Nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+14%3A13%2C21" title="Romans 14:13,21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 14:13,21)</span></a></span> The opposite of pure motives would be seeking to attract attention by speech, actions or dress. Examine your own heart to see if its motives for the way you dress are pure and chaste.</p>

<p>3) <i>God&#8217;s Perspective.</i> Other than these general principles, the Bible also gives women some guidelines specifically about clothing. These are probably familiar passages, but let&#8217;s look at them again: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A3-4" title="I&nbsp;Peter 3:3-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 3:3-4)</span></a></span> When I read this, I often hurry through it, without fully realizing the meaning of that last phrase! <span class="scripture">&#8220;Which is in the sight of God of great price.&#8221;</span> God values highly a woman with the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit. <span class="scripture">&#8220;The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+25%3A9" title="Psalm 25:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 25:9)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Since God looks at our hearts, and we realize that a spirit of meekness is so special to Him, why should I be worried about &#8220;looking pretty&#8221; outwardly? How important is it to try to hook &#8220;perfect&#8221; or &#8220;just right&#8221; to others, when the Father looks down on a quiet, simply dressed, meek-spirited woman and smiles with delight? Shouldn&#8217;t we all long to please Him this way?</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s look at 1 Timothy 2:9-10. <span class="scripture">&#8220;In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+2%3A9-10" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 2:9-10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 2:9-10)</span></a></span> Read that verse again to yourself. Are you &#8220;professing godliness&#8221;? Then this very much applies to you. Here we read that not only is meekness valued, so are the &#8220;good works&#8221; of a woman who is adorned with &#8220;shamefacedness and sobriety&#8221; rather than &#8220;costly array.&#8221;</p>

<p>What image do the words <i>shamefaced</i> and <i>sober</i> bring to your mind? A girl who isn&#8217;t trying to catch the eyes of a fellow? One who is friendly and comfortable around others, but not seeking attention and favor from the boys? These both would be girls who are striving toward a spirit of meekness, sobriety and shamefacedness.</p>

<p>I realize I haven&#8217;t specifically stated whether dresses or pants are best for the godly young woman to wear. I have my own convictions, of course, following what I know is the Lord&#8217;s will for my life. Personally, I don&#8217;t wear pants because I believe it pleases the Lord when I am dressed in a way that is distinctly feminine and modest. Let&#8217;s pause and look at that idea, of looking &#8220;distinctly feminine.&#8221; First, what does the Word of God say about it? <span class="scripture">&#8220;The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman&#8217;s garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> thy God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+22%3A5" title="Deuteronomy 22:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Deuteronomy 22:5)</span></a></span> I believe this implies that there must be a difference, a distinction, between the clothing and appearance of men and women.</p>

<p>For hundreds of years in our society, dresses were the established garment for women, and only men ever wore pants. It was a lady who was very much for women&#8217;s rights and all that who first started the trend for women to wear &#8220;bloomers.&#8221; These were loose-fitting pants, and they shocked the entire nation. Eventually, however, people became accustomed to it, and as they say, the rest is history.</p>

<p>I used to wear jeans, and never knew anything different. But after becoming a Christian when I was 12, I began to question what the world termed &#8220;normal.&#8221; After reading the Word of God and listening to other godly young ladies, when I was 15 I decided that I would start wearing skirts, dresses and jumpers. But the Lord has brought me a long way since then, showing me even more I could do to please Him. That&#8217;s how it goes, when you allow the Lord to begin working in your life: He begins to lead us along His path, showing us new truths every step of the way.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t judge those sisters who choose to wear pants, since I don&#8217;t know their hearts as the Lord does. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Who art thou that judgest another man&#8217;s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+14%3A4" title="Romans 14:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 14:4)</span></a></span> I know many Christian women who don&#8217;t feel convicted to wear dresses or skirts, and I can see by their lives that they love and serve God. I believe God looks past the outward appearance, and sees the heart that is humble, seeking to love and please Him. Yet, if you are convicted in your heart that you shouldn&#8217;t continue to wear pants, and hesitate to follow the &#8220;still, small voice,&#8221; consider: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+4%3A17" title="James 4:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 4:17)</span></a></span>  Spend time in prayer, study God&#8217;s Word, and talk to your parents.</p>

<p>We know that modesty is a state of the heart, not just a way of dress. So the question is really: &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with my heart?&#8221; more than, &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with pants?&#8221; Evaluate your motives, searching your heart and the Scriptures. I even need to step back at times, and look at my dresses through the eyes of the Lord. Even though it&#8217;s a dress, does the waist fit too tightly? Is the skirt long enough? What does Dad think about it? I have found that one can still harbor impure motives with a seemingly outward &#8220;modesty.&#8221; Just because it&#8217;s a dress or a skirt doesn&#8217;t guarantee anything.</p>

<p>I wish I had time to share all the tips on everyday dress-wearing I had thought of, but I&#8217;ll leave that to another sister as I feel I&#8217;ve gone on long enough! I hope these thoughts have been helpful to encourage each of you toward a spirit of modesty. May God bless you, as you strive to follow Him. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+5%3A39" title="John 5:39"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 5:39)</span></a></span></p>

<h2>Our Clothing: A Distinclion Between Male and Female</h2>
<p>I wear only skirts, dresses, or jumpers because I believe they are more modest and feminine than shorts and pants. I cannot, however, say that pants and shorts are for men only, because in the Bible times, both men and women wore robe or dress-like apparel. However, I think it raises less questions if men only wear pants/shorts, and it also puts a greater distinction between men and women.</p>

<p>But on the modesty side, I feel that I know dresses, skirts, and jumpers are more modest. Shorts reveal far too much of my body, and pants reveal too much of my figure. Men are affected (much easier than you or I can imagine) by the sight of a female in shorts/pants. Scripture says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel&#8230;&#8203;not with broided hair&#8230;&#8203;or costly array.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+2%3A9" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 2:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 2:9)</span></a></span> And in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+14%3A21">Romans 14:21</a> we are told not do anything that might cause a brother to stumble. <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+22%3A5">Deuteronomy 22:5</a> also commands women to not wear men&#8217;s apparel, and vice-versa; I feel it is safer to place greater distinctions between our clothing and men&#8217;s.</p>

<p>I wear skirts/dresses/jumpers that fall about 1/2 to 3 inches above my ankles and I feel those lengths sufficiently cover me. But for riding bikes and certain other activities, skirt-like culottes are probably the way to go.</p>

<p>I usually find my clothing in consignment stores or the Salvation Army. However, options are limited, so I&#8217;d suggest that you find some modest patterns to sew.</p>

<p>Tips? Well, not really&#8230;. Mmm, I&#8217;d say to make sure your skirts, etc., aren&#8217;t too long/full or you&#8217;ll trip on them (I learned the hard way!) Oh, I live in Pennsylvania, where it gets quite cold, so I have to make sure I can keep my legs warm. My solution is: to buy leggings! Land&#8217;s End sells very well-made leggings, and I love my pairs! They fit just like tights, except they&#8217;re about four times as thick and warm!</p>

<p>About swimming guidelines&#8230;&#8203;well, I do not believe in mixed swimming (men and women swimming together who are not closely related, as in brothers and fathers. I feel it is immoral and tempts our Christian (or non-Christian) brothers to think lustful and wrong things.</p>

<h2>Set Apart from the World</h2>
<p>I would like to share something with you that the Lord has revealed to me and my family concerning the subject of &#8220;modest apparel,&#8221; and I hope that you will benefit from it as we/I did.</p>

<p>First of all there is the question of women and girls wearing pants. But what&#8217;s wrong with it? Hmmm&#8230;&#8203;well, let&#8217;s allow the scripture to take care of that question: <span class="scripture">&#8220;The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man [pants, huh?]&#8230;&#8203;for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+22%3A5" title="Deuteronomy 22:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Deuteronomy 22:5)</span></a></span> But why does God say that? What&#8217;s the reason? Well, isn&#8217;t that what the &#8220;world&#8221; does? And if we do the things the &#8220;world&#8221; does won&#8217;t we be associated with the world? And do we&#8212;who are God&#8217;s chosen ones&#8212;want to be associated with the &#8220;world&#8221; and its people?&#8212;which will be destroyed at the second coming (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+3%3A10">II&nbsp;Peter 3:10</a>). <span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherefore come out from among [the world] and be ye separate, saith the Lord.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+6%3A17" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 6:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 6:17)</span></a></span> But (and I know about this argument because I used to use it) &#8220;don&#8217;t pants keep you warmer in winter?&#8221; Maybe. But that seems like a poor excuse to give to God&#8217;s command. You can even wear bloomers under your skirt.</p>

<p>Pants show what dresses and skirts are meant to hide. We wear clothes to conceal and not to reveal. <span class="scripture">&#8220;In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+2%3A9" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 2:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 2:9)</span></a></span></p>

<p>We should make sure whatever we wear is not tight or formfitting. Whatever we wear should be backed with Biblical significance, and we should be able to know without any doubt that God is pleased with what you are wearing.</p>

<p>I hope I have not come across too strong&#8212;it is not my intention to offend anyone nor to be too harsh. If you do not agree with what I have said then it is up to you and the Lord&#8212;the only One we are truly accountable to. I hope that at the last day, when we stand before the judgement seat of Christ, that we may all say, <span class="scripture">&#8220;<b>I have glorified thee on earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.</b>&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+17%3A4" title="John 17:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 17:4)</span></a></span> And then hear Him say, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Well, done, thou good and faithful servant&#8230;&#8203;enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+25%3A21" title="Matthew 25:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 25:21)</span></a></span></p>

<p>The final scripture I would like to close with is: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not, to him it is a sin.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+4%3A17" title="James 4:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 4:17)</span></a></span></p>

<p>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all!</p>

<h2>Our Actions Speak Louder Than Words</h2>
<p class="noindent">My dear sisters,</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+12%3A1" title="Romans 12:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 12:1)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Unto Adam also and to his wife did the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God make coats of skins, and clothed them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+3%3A21" title="Genesis 3:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 3:21)</span></a></span></p>

<p>When the first humans sinned they realized their nakedness. Because they were ashamed they attempted to cover themselves with fig leaves. However when God found them, He saw that their sorry attempts were not sufficient and the first death occurred in the garden; God killed a beast and sewed them coats of skin and clothed them.</p>

<p>In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+6%3A15">II&nbsp;Corinthians 6:15</a> it says: <span class="scripture">&#8220;And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them and walk in them; and I will be their God and they shall be my people.&#8221;</span> It clearly states here that we as Christians are the temple of God! Because God lives in us all that we do should reflect Him, His love, and His will.</p>

<p>Continuing on in 2 Corinthians it says: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+6%3A17-18" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 6:17-18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 6:17-18)</span></a></span></p>

<p>We are commanded to come out from among the world. We are <i>not</i> to go with the flow, we are <i>not</i> to mingle with the rest, but rather we are to go against the grain and stand alone.</p>

<p>One very vital way in which we can make a difference for Christ is in how we dress. This is also one of the ways that the world around us will notice our testimony the most, though we should not &#8220;be different&#8221; simply for attention. In a world where fashion, fame, and beauty seen to be the ultimate goal it is most important that we keep ourselves pure.</p>

<p>How might we remain pure in an impure world? By not allowing the many things of this world to control how we live, but rather God and His Word and His will.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3Al" title="Hebrews 12:l"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 12:l)</span></a></span> The world is watching us. It sees our every move. They know that Christ lives in us. <span class="scripture">&#8220;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+2%3A20" title="Galatians 2:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 2:20)</span></a></span> If by our actions, talk, or dress (or over all) we do not testify of our salvation, how them can they believe the words, &#8220;I am a Christian&#8221;?</p>

<p>When we dress as the world does, with tight, contour shirts and short shorts or skirts/dresses, or even pants, we are accepting what society says is acceptable. &#8220;It&#8217;s cool&#8221;; &#8220;Everyone else does it.&#8221; Why should we be different? Because the Word of God commands it! (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+6%3A17-18">II&nbsp;Corinthians 6:17-18</a>).</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; you say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want my peers to think I&#8217;m weird, or holier than they.&#8221;</p>

<p>First of all, if the think we&#8217;re weird, chances are that they feel uncomfortable with you dressed modestly, and that is probably because they are convicted.</p>

<p>Secondly, if your attitude is right, then it&#8217;s only a figment of your peers&#8217; imaginations about you being holier than they. However if your attitude is not right and you do act holier, then it&#8217;s time for you to change that. The old saying goes: &#8220;Actions speak louder than words,&#8221; but&#8230;&#8203;attitude speaks louder than both.</p>

<p>There is yet another reason we should be dressing modestly. It is of great importance; as great as the first. &#8220;Girl&#8217;s skirts started creeping upward in 1964&#8230;. Simultaneously&#8230;&#8203;crimes against women began a dramatic increase. FBI crime files show the rate of forcible rape&#8230;&#8203;shot upward in 1964 and each year since.&#8221;</p>

<p>What about pants? They don&#8217;t have to be worn tightly, and they cover all of a person&#8217;s legs.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman&#8217;s garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> thy God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+22%3A5" title="Deuteronomy 22:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Deuteronomy 22:5)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Jeans and pants are generally men&#8217;s clothing, not women&#8217;s. Have you ever noticed the signs on public bathroom doors? The men&#8217;s room has a silhouette of a person in pants and the woman&#8217;s room has a silhouette of a person in a dress. Now obviously if you were a small child or illiterate, you could still tell which bathroom was which&#8230;&#8203;the dress makes the distinction. </p>

<p>Likewise, in real life we should dress in such a way that there could no mistaking our gender.</p>

<p>However, there are times when dresses would be immodest. For instance, if you are standing on a ladder painting a house or walls, it would be most inappropriate to be wearing a dress or maybe even culottes (because they&#8217;re baggy). Any person could inadvertently look upward&#8230;. Also, though this is not really immodest, it is a safety issue&#8212;when skiing it is unwise to wear dresses. Skiing is a relatively dangerous sport anyway, there is no need to place oneself in a more dangerous position. There is yet one other instance in which dresses should not be worn, and that is when jumping on a trampoline&#8230;.</p>

<p>In closing, here are some things to consider doing:</p>

<p>a) I&#8217;ll ask the Lord for an honest, submissive, open-hearted attitude as I study this topic.</p>

<p>b) I&#8217;ll ask my father/husband if anything I wear is in the least bit immodest or suggestive.</p>

<p>c) I will purpose in my heart to wear&#8230;&#8203;what I would feel comfortable wearing should Jesus come and see me wearing</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And be renewed in the spirit of your mind.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+4%3A23" title="Ephesians 4:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 4:23)</span></a></span></p>

<p>God bless you as you pray about and consider this very important issue.</p>

<h2>A Sister&#8217;s Testimony</h2>
<p>Hello to all the other Princesses out there.</p>

<p>I would like to share my opinion on why I wear dresses.</p>

<p>First of all, I think it is between me and God. I think Jesus wants me to wear dresses, because I am a girl. Some people, out in the world, you can hardly tell if they are male or female. Also, when people look on us, they usually think, &#8220;Oh, there is someone who loves the Lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>I also have a scripture: <span class="scripture">&#8220;The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman&#8217;s garment.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+22%3A5" title="Deuteronomy 22:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Deuteronomy 22:5)</span></a></span></p>

<p>That is why I wear dresses.</p>

<h2>An Essay on Modesty</h2>
<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Beware of the false prophets who come to you in sheep&#8217;s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+7%3A15" title="Matthew 7:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 7:15)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New American Standard Bible">NASB</span></p>

<p>I suppose some people will argue what you wear doesn&#8217;t really matter. I don&#8217;t agree. I believe what you wear shows your attitude, or is deliberately covering it up. According to the above verse, wolves can wear sheep&#8217;s clothing, &#8220;you just have to be careful.&#8221; Have you ever seen a sheep wear wolves&#8217; clothing? Of course not! Sheep don&#8217;t need to deceive, they are wonderful just the way they are. (I don&#8217;t have anything against the canine wolf, this is just illustration.) Why should you, as one of God&#8217;s sheep, try to wear the clothing of your enemy? A sheep&#8217;s clothing is modest, quiet, and tries to reflect God. So how do you manage that? What is modesty?</p>

<h3>What Is Modesty?</h3>
<p>Modesty: That lowly temper which accompanies a moderate estimate of one&#8217;s own worth and importance. In females&#8217; modesty has the like character as in males; but the word is used as synonymous with chastity or purity of manners. (Noah Webster&#8217;s 1828 Dictionary).</p>

<p>So to be modest is not to be forward or bold, boastful or arrogant. That includes the way we dress, but especially our actions. However in this essay we will dwell on the outer covering we call clothing. Why Skirts?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve hear many people say we, as ladies, should wear skirts because pants are too masculine. Personally, I don&#8217;t hold that idea. In Jesus&#8217; time, the men wore clothes that would be considered girl&#8217;s clothes today (in America at least). [Interjection from Editresses: although this is true, in Bible times both men and women wore robes, it is also true that there was a border of cloth around men&#8217;s clothing, making a distinction that was very important to the people. It was considered very disgraceful for anyone to wear the clothing of the opposite gender. Why else would God consider it important to mention that to do so was abomination to Him?] The styles are just changing. There are women&#8217;s pants as well as men&#8217;s pants. Yet, I do wear skirts, but for a different reason. I believe [pants] are immodest. You see, a man has a different mindset than a woman. That is why Jesus said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+5%3A28" title="Matthew 5:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 5:28)</span></a></span> He knew the male mind had lots more trouble [in temptation] to lust than the female. They are enticed by visual stimulants. Just ask your dad, or brother, if tight-fitting ladies&#8217; clothing doesn&#8217;t cause second glances. If being modest means not attracting attention, [we should not want to cause a stumbling block to our brothers] by wearing pants. Short skirts, knee-length or higher are not any better and may be worse in some cases.</p>

<p>Some of you may be thinking, &#8220;Why should I have to worry about someone else&#8217;s mind? If they lust, it is their problem.&#8221; Cain asked the same question. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Am I my brother&#8217;s keeper?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+4%3A9" title="Genesis 4:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 4:9)</span></a></span> God said, &#8220;You sure are!&#8221; He says the same to you.</p>

<h3>Are the Skirts Practical?</h3>
<p>Well, I wear skirts all day, every day. Even when I&#8217;m riding my bike or playing ball. The only thing is, don&#8217;t wear skirts with buttons all the way down the front when you&#8217;re being active. The buttons pop off or rip along with part of the skirt. For bike riding I wear a tighter skirt, that&#8217;s just loose enough so it&#8217;s comfortable to pedal. In other active endeavors I wear really loose skirts that are about mid-calf length or longer. Be sure to wear something underneath so if you fall you aren&#8217;t immodest. I wear stirrup pants almost all the time and bike shorts when I go barefoot.</p>

<p>The winter is a slightly different story. In the house it&#8217;s alright to wear skirts, and I suppose in warmer climates you can wear them outside without much discomfort. I happen to live right next to Canada and its cold! Sometimes its 20&deg; or 30&deg; F with strong winds. Not wearing proper protection can be life-threatening. I enjoy dog sledding and so I end up going out in all weather (except the worst blizzards). I put ski pants on under my skirts to stay warm.</p>

<h3>What about the other parts of my body?</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ll go from top down and start with our hair. In a hairstyle I look for practicality and beauty, not flashy. I also like them to be quick to put up. A single braid is the simplest and best for a lot of things. It keeps your hair out of the way, in good condition and is very simple. A bun or snood (a sort of hairnet) is the next in simplicity and timewise. Pigtail braids are fine for younger girls, but they do get in the way sometimes. My favorite, and the one I currently wear is the Heidi braids. Of all the styles I use this is the most time-consuming. The Heidi braid is pigtails wrapped around over your head and pinned in place. You need fairly long hair to do it correctly. For the night I just let them down and sleep in the pigtails. This keeps the part, and it is really easy to brush out one at a time in the morning. So pick a hairstyle you like, one that fits your face and stick with it.</p>

<p>Your face is the most important part of your body. People should be able to see Jesus in it. A character of peace and serenity will make the plainest face beautiful, and will attract people to what is right. That is part of the reason I don&#8217;t wear makeup. It may shock people to think of it, but I truly think makeup destroys beauty. My dad is happy because I don&#8217;t, even though sometimes I wish I could cover some things up. No makeup means you&#8217;ll have to take better care of your face so you don&#8217;t get embarrassed. It needs to be washed at least once a day, and junk food (pop and chocolate mostly) makes acne worse. Zinc and cod liver gelcaps are said to help. Let the love of Jesus shine through, and you will have the most beautiful face in the world.</p>

<p>I see my hands as things to be used, but not abused or pampered. I do a lot of hard work that has, over time, given me quite a few scars on my hands. I don&#8217;t wear any rings, though for awhile I wore a simple ring my brother gave me, just to remember his kindness.</p>

<p>Your top needs to show modesty as well. I generally avoid T-shirts, as they are rather clingy and form-fitting. Words or designs across the front may do everything from proclaiming your beliefs to advertise for some company, but it attracts attention where you don&#8217;t want it. V-necks and low necklines also attract away from your face. A blouse with a high neckline stops any wandering eyes, and puts the attention on your face. I&#8217;ve found with no-sleeved blouses that if I move my arms anyone who happens to glance my way gets an eyeful, and I don&#8217;t want that. See-through material is equally as bad, while heavy sweatshirts look and feel a little too sloppy for me, though some like them. Please, make your choices carefully!</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know what to say about feet. I&#8217;ve worn everything from bare feet to heavy winter boots. I think high heels are bad for your ankles, as well as drawing unnecessary attention. I have a pair of hiking/work/riding boots that I wear almost all the time. They are comfortable and work well. For church I have some black lace-up shoes.</p>

<h3>What Will Others Think?</h3>
<p>Well, I do get asked what I&#8217;m up to, sometimes by complete strangers. An interpretive guide at a historical site once asked if we belonged to a special group, as both my sister and I were wearing long skirts and black shoes. I&#8217;m sorry to say we didn&#8217;t have a good answer for him, but we did think it was funny. If he asked me now, I would simply answer, &#8220;We just believe this is the way we, as ladies, should dress.&#8221; As far as I know, people respect me more for living up to my beliefs.</p>

<p>If you wear dresses, you&#8217;ll have to be really careful in public. When I see ladies wearing modest clothing, I automatically assume they are like-minded, and most likely home schoolers if there are young children around. If you do something un-Christlike, someone will see you and wonder if you&#8217;re as real as you look. None of us want to give anyone a bad example of Bible-believing Christians!</p>

<p>God bless you, dear sisters.</p>

<h2>Modesty: An Attribute of a Servant of God</h2>
<div class="blurb"><p class="first">Written by Amy Zander (18) with much help from her mother, Mrs. Mary Zander.</p>
</div>


<p>Modesty is said to be: &#8220;Decency, humbleness, not bold or forward, not extravagant or excessive, chastity, purity of manners. Modesty results from purity of mind, and unaffected modesty is the sweetest charm of female excellence, the richest gem in the diadem of their honor.&#8221; (Gathered from Webster&#8217;s 1828 dictionary). The issue of modesty is one that has generated much discussion. There are many different views on this subject, and it is easy to get perplexed when trying to find out what is the truth. However, if we keep our focus on the Lord, Who is The Truth, all confusion will clear away. The Lord has mercifully revealed many truths in His Word to my family and me, and He has blessed us for our willingness to follow Him. As Christians, born-again believers of the Lord Jesus Christ, we should always seek the truth in the Bible. What does the Bible have to say about modesty? And how does the world&#8217;s (or our human) view differ from the Word?</p>

<p>When I was younger we joined a church that had many members who firmly believed that pants were wrong and a sin for women to wear. We had never heard about this before, but we soon did. We always wore dresses to church and church activities and desired to be godly in what we wore, but we did wear pants at home. No one ever explained to us clearly from the Bible <i>why</i> it was wrong for ladies to wear pants. As God moved us to a new area five years ago, the Lord started to gently open our hearts to see what <i>He</i> had to say about clothing. At first, when He started to deal with us about it, we didn&#8217;t want to consider the matter. Yet God was very patient with us. He truly is a longsuffering, loving Lord! We then learned what the Bible had to say about clothing, what was pleasing, or not pleasing, to God. Our conviction on the issue of modesty is now firmly based on <i>His Word</i>, not on what a church said to do, traditions, or what man said was appropriate. <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+2%3A8">Colossians 2:8</a> cautions us by saying, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.&#8221;</span></p>

<h3>Main Clothing of the Christian: The Attire of the Heart and Soul</h3>
<p>The first step to being modest is clothing your &#8220;insides&#8221;&#8212;after all, the work of salvation that beautifies sinners like you and me and makes us children of God <i>begins</i> in the transformed, blood-washed soul and heart! If you are a born-again believer (and I pray and trust that you are), you are now a daughter of the King, and <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+45%3A13">Psalm 45:13</a> says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;The king&#8217;s daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.&#8221;</span> Our ardent desire should be that we would be &#8220;all glorious within,&#8221; and thus please our Savior by having a lovely spirit, soul, heart, and mind. Notice that this verse in Psalm 45 mentions that the king&#8217;s daughter has clothing wrought of gold. What is gold? Gold means (besides money and a precious metal): to be clear, something pleasing, shining, excellent, pure. Do we put on clothing of gold? The opportunity is presented from our Heavenly Father, we can have golden clothing! How? By adorning our spirit with purity and allowing Jesus to shine through us. <i>Purity</i>, such a noble word! Once we become Christians, our Lord cleanses us from all our sin and He purifies us. Gold, when it is 100% pure, is transparent (like crystal), not yellow. Isn&#8217;t that interesting? A servant of God who adorns herself/himself with garments of pure gold will have a crystalline spirit that shines and radiates only Christ!</p>

<p>What is the spiritual &#8220;clothing&#8221; that we should possess? Most importantly, and first on the list is mentioned in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+132%3A16">Psalm 132:16</a>. We should be clothed <span class="scripture">&#8220;with salvation&#8221;</span>! Isaiah said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;I will greatly rejoice in the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+61%3A10" title="Isaiah 61:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 61:10)</span></a></span> Have you garments of salvation, and the robe of righteousness? If you do not, if you are not a born-again believer, then please, won&#8217;t you get saved, and get right with God? So you may be clothed with the righteousness only He can give? Job said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Job+29%3A14" title="Job 29:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Job 29:14)</span></a></span></p>

<p>After salvation and righteousness, there are several other significant articles of clothing the Bible mentions. We should all be <span class="scripture">&#8220;clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+5%3A5" title="I&nbsp;Peter 5:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 5:5)</span></a></span> We should <span class="scripture">&#8220;Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+3%3A12" title="Colossians 3:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 3:12)</span></a></span>, and strength and honor should also be a part of our inner clothing (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+31%3A25">Proverbs 31:25</a>). <span class="scripture">&#8220;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. And they that are Christ&#8217;s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+5%3A22-25" title="Galatians 5:22-25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 5:22-25)</span></a></span> This, too, is part of our inner garments. As we grow in Jesus, our life will bear good fruit, and the modest servant of God will manifest &#8220;garments&#8221; of love, longsuffering, faith, a life crucified with Christ&#8217;s and a life that has submitted all to her Savior.</p>

<p>This spiritual clothing is not like the fable of the &#8220;Emperor&#8217;s New Clothes.&#8221; They can be seen in our lives; for example, you <i>know</i> when a person is clothed with humility&#8230;&#8203;and you also know when a person is full of pride. A person clothed with these spiritual traits will be: teachable; wanting to learn and know God&#8217;s Word; grateful; a good testimony; submissive, not rebellious; meek, and not look down on others; they will be a reflection of Jesus.</p>

<h3>A Modest Spirit</h3>
<p>A modest heart (inside) will produce a modest Christian for all to see (outside). As Christ said, what is in man&#8217;s heart will come out (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+12%3A35%3B+Luke+6%3A43-45">Matthew 12:35; Luke 6:43-45</a>). Inward holiness will work itself outward! If modesty were just wearing the right clothing, oh how easy it would be! Modest clothing <i>does not guarantee</i> a modest spirit and heart. &#8220;Dressing up&#8221; before God is a matter of inner condition (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A4">I&nbsp;Peter 3:4</a>) and outward conduct (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+2%3A10">I&nbsp;Timothy 2:10</a>). Modesty reflects a godly, humble, loving, spirit all the way through. Which of the following is of a modest spirit?</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">&#8220;<i>I</i> believe that <i>I</i> am to wear modest clothing. <i>I</i> would never even <i>dream</i> of wearing immodest dothes, it would be <i>so</i> disgraceful. Really, <i>I</i> don&#8217;t know how others can be so blind about this. <i>I&#8217;m</i> so thankful that <i>I</i> saw the truth. <i>I&#8217;m</i> wearing this type of clothing as a sign of <i>my</i> obedience to God.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Or:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">&#8220;The Lord has been <i>very</i> good to me and I love Him <i>so much</i>! I was <i>lost</i> in <i>sin</i> when Jesus found me, but <i>He</i> took me and saved me. I used to wear clothes that gave glory to the flesh, and remembering that brings grief to my heart, but when the Lord became my Savior, my desire was to wear what would please and glorify <i>Him</i>. Even though I have struggles with many things in my life, God is so <i>faithful</i> to daily help me!&#8221;</p>

<p>One portrays an immodest, prideful spirit, and the other a modest, humble spirit. Example 1 points others to <i>self</i> and its beliefs and accomplishments, while Example 2 points others to <i>God</i> and properly magnifies the Lord.</p>

<p>Consider the following passage: <span class="scripture">&#8220;And [Jesus] spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+18%3A9-14" title="Luke 18:9-14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 18:9-14)</span></a></span></p>

<p>When we believe God wants us to wear certain dothing, it is important to obey. But let us be careful to not forget our position&#8230;&#8203;a humble servant of the Lord. Remember, <span class="scripture">&#8220;A gracious woman retaineth honour,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+11%3A16" title="Proverbs 11:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 11:16)</span></a></span> and <span class="scripture">&#8220;what doth the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Micah+6%3A8" title="Micah 6:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Micah 6:8)</span></a></span> Modesty quietly obeys, portraying the meek heart of a servant. Immodesty by word or manner paints a picture of the proud heart, saying, &#8220;Look how well <i>I</i> follow God.&#8221;</p>

<h3>God&#8217;s Reaction to Man&#8217;s Fall: He Clothed Them</h3>
<p>Does it really matter to God if we wear modest clothing or not? In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+3">Genesis 3</a>, right after man fell into sin, notice one of the <i>first</i> things God did as He dealt with their sin. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Unto Adam also and to his w~fedidtheL<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God make coats of skins, and clothed them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+3%3A21" title="Genesis 3:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 3:21)</span></a></span> God clothed Adam and Eve! Adam and Eve had dressed themselves with aprons of fig leaves sewn together (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+3%3A7">Genesis 3:7</a>), but apparently it wasn&#8217;t enough in God&#8217;s sight, for He made them &#8220;<i>coats</i> of skins.&#8221; The world&#8217;s standard is an apron, God&#8217;s standard is a coat. God&#8217;s approach was to clothe them modestly, cover their nakedness, even though no one else was around. As children of a Holy God we should desire to please Him and be clothed in a manner that is pure in His sight.</p>

<p>What is nakedness? In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+3%3A7">Genesis 3:7</a> we see human reason deciding what is modest (aprons, mini-skirts, swimsuits, etc.), and in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+3%3A21">Genesis 3:21</a> we see God&#8217;s standard (coats, long tunics, long, flowing dresses, etc.) God clothed both male and female, both needed to be modest and have their nakedness covered. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Exodus+28%3A42" title="Exodus 28:42"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Exodus 28:42)</span></a></span> God was very concerned with the priests&#8217; modesty and holiness. God allowed no steps up to His altar because He didn&#8217;t want their nakedness to be revealed. The Lord took another measure to insure holiness, the priests wore robes plus breeches. We see this same truth in Isaiah: <span class="scripture">&#8220;uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh&#8230;. Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+47%3A2-3" title="Isaiah 47:2-3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 47:2-3)</span></a></span> We&#8217;re to be covered down to our knees, if not, God considers it nakedness.</p>

<p>What is revealed when nakedness is uncovered? <i>Shame.</i> When Moses went up into Mt. Sinai to commune with God, the children of Israel fell into sin. When Moses came down, he <span class="scripture">&#8220;saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies).&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Exodus+32%3A25" title="Exodus 32:25"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Exodus 32:25)</span></a></span> <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+16%3A15">Revelation 16:15</a> admonishes, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Blessed is he that&#8230;&#8203;keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.&#8221;</span> Shame is likened unto a garment. <span class="scripture">&#8220;They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Job+8%3A22" title="Job 8:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Job 8:22)</span></a></span> and David asked, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+109%3A29" title="Psalm 109:29"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 109:29)</span></a></span> Pride also produces shame: <span class="scripture">&#8220;When pride cometh, then cometh shame.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+11%3A2" title="Proverbs 11:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 11:2)</span></a></span> Jesus Christ told John, <span class="scripture">&#8220;of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen&#8230;&#8203;I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot&#8230;. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+3%3A14-18" title="Revelation 3:14-18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 3:14-18)</span></a></span> Truly, what a picture of professed Christians today! Naked, full of pride, and not even realizing it. God is counseling us today to be clothed, so that <span class="scripture">&#8220;the shame of [our] nakedness&#8221;</span> does not appear.</p>

<p>Could displaying our nakedness actually mock the Son of God and the Cross of Calvary? Isaiah often spoke of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, and our Savior speaking says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+50%3A6" title="Isaiah 50:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 50:6)</span></a></span> Our Savior did not hide Himself from shame. Do you realize that He hung naked upon the Cross? He suffered more shame than you and I can ever imagine or experience. God manifested in the flesh, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously: Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+2%3A22-24" title="I&nbsp;Peter 2:22-24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 2:22-24)</span></a></span> Dare we make a mockery (even subtly) of what He went through to redeem sinners like you and I, by exposing nakedness? God does care about covering nakedness.</p>


<h2>Don&#8217;t Do as Egypt (the World)</h2>
<p><b>The person who has the spiritual clothing of a Christian right, will also be concerned, teachable, and eager about getting the outer clothing right as well.</b> Are we more concerned with being in style today, or with being right with God? The serious Christian will not follow the fashions of the sinful world. <span class="scripture">&#8220;I am the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> your God. After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do&#8230;. Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Leviticus+18%3A2-4" title="Leviticus 18:2-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Leviticus 18:2-4)</span></a></span> Worldly dress draws attention to the body, reflecting what is sensual, extravagant and rebellious. Is what we wear a true statement of who we are in Christ or is there confusion about who we belong to? <span class="scripture">&#8220;What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God&#8217;s.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+6%3A19-20" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 6:19-20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 6:19-20)</span></a></span></p>

<p>One day I was in a store with my mother and sisters, and as usual we were wearing dresses. In the store I noticed a young woman who looked nice in feminine attire. I thought to myself, &#8220;I wonder if she a Christian?&#8221; While shopping, the young woman actually approached me and spoke to me. &#8220;Hello! I was just wondering if you are a Christian, are you?&#8221; I replied that, yes, I was and she said, &#8220;I thought so, you and your mother and sisters <i>look like Christians</i>&#8221; (emphasis added). And I said that I had thought that <i>she</i> was a Christian because she looked like one, too. What we wear does send a &#8220;message&#8221; out to the world. If we don&#8217;t look like Christians on the outside, could it be that no one would know that we are Christians? We need to live in a way that will leave <i>no doubt</i> in any person&#8217;s mind of Who we belong to, and we need to be a faithful witness for the Lord in all areas of our life.</p>

<p>Police have noticed that as immodesty prevails, ungodliness prevails (like abuse or assault). The world&#8217;s way of dressing is dangerous. We are each responsible before the Lord that we are not a cause of someone&#8217;s stumbling (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+5%3A28%3B+1+Corinthians+8%3A9">Matthew 5:28; I&nbsp;Corinthians 8:9</a>). Sadly, many Christians blend in so well with the crowd at the mall, that you don&#8217;t know they are Christians. Instead of demanding purity and holiness of ourselves we often cave in to the lure of the world. We should desire to be dressed according to Heaven&#8217;s design, not Hollywood&#8217;s.</p>

<p>As God looks upon us will He be pleased? Often <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A3-4">I&nbsp;Peter 3:3-4</a> is cited when discussing modesty, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.&#8221;</span> Modesty, using 1 Peter 3 as a partial definition, involves having a meek, quiet, godly heart and spirit, as I&#8217;ve mentioned already. In 1 Timothy 2:9 we find modest clothing defined again, with <i>over</i>dressing being contrasted with &#8220;shamefacedness.&#8221; I am reminded of the many birds that surround our little farm. The males are bright and beautiful with their coloring, but have you noticed that most female birds have quiet, neutral features? The male cardinal, for example, is dressed in brilliant scarlet, and stands out from the other birds and the trees and bushes. In contrast, the female cardinal is dressed in a rich but subdued brown, with touches of red here and there; she is always in the background, though close to her male companion. This distinction between male and female is also true of many other creatures that God has created, can we not learn a lesson from nature (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Job+12%3A7-10">Job 12:7-10</a>)? [Of course, God has a higher standard for mankind than for His birds. They have no sense of modesty as we, men and women should have. &#8212;Ed.] We, too, as young single women, and as married women, should dress and live in a serene, virtuous manner. Does this mean that we can never laugh or be lighthearted? By no means; but we should not seek to be so prominent that where ever we go, we draw unnecessary attention to ourselves. Rather, we should draw attention to our Heavenly Father, and if need be our father/husband and brothers/sons. So much sorrow and shame would be spared if only we would be satisfied with the &#8220;umbrella of protection&#8221; God has provided!</p>

<h3>A Little History</h3>
<p>What is modest clothing for men and women? Biblically and historically, the men have always worn the &#8220;breeches&#8221; or pants, and the women the long &#8220;robes&#8221; and dresses. Yes, in Bible times men did wear robes, but they were not as long as women&#8217;s and they wore breeches underneath. It is interesting to study the history of clothing in North America. From the time the first Pilgrims arrived, to the beginning of this century, clothing for women did not change that much. Women basically wore long skirts with blouses or long dresses. Can you guess who started the move toward pants and shorter skirts? It was the first <i>feminists</i> in the late 1800&#8217;s. They insisted that women had miserable lives, and should be liberated. The feminist thought that part of the answer was for women to dress and act like men. One of these women was named Mrs. Bloomer (we still use the word bloomer to describe the baggy pants she advocated). In 1851 the early feminists were denied admission to most churches and buildings even though they had a skirt past the knee and bloomers to their ankles. When she realized it was hurting the women&#8217;s movement, Mrs. Bloomer gave up trying to wear men&#8217;s clothing, and no more was heard of women wearing pants for many years. As the feminist movement grew, the push to dress like men grew, too. Shorter hair and pants (to name a few) are all socially acceptable today, less than one hundred years later. Wouldn&#8217;t these early feminists be pleased to see the way most women dress today?</p>

<h3>The Concealed Abomination</h3>
<p>Abomination is a forceful word that means God hates with <i>strong</i> hatred certain things. There is an abomination that is, for the most part, never mentioned. We speak out strongly against the abominations of sodomy or adultery, but there is one we seem to forget. <span class="scripture">&#8220;The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman&#8217;s garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> thy God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+22%3A5" title="Deuteronomy 22:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Deuteronomy 22:5)</span></a></span> Now, I know that this verse gets quoted a lot, but it is very serious. You may object, saying it is an Old Testament passage and can&#8217;t be for today, yet it is, for <span class="scripture">&#8220;All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+3%3A16" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 3:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 3:16)</span></a></span> We are to <span class="scripture">&#8220;Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. Abstain from all appearance of evil.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+5%3A21-22" title="I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:21-22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:21-22)</span></a></span> If God hates something, would it not be evil? Are we avoiding even the <i>appearance</i> of evil?</p>

<p>The one thing that caught my family&#8217;s attention when we were studying this issue out was that it is an <i>abomination</i> for a woman or a man to wear clothing not meant for them. Abomination links you up to several kinds of people: those that make graven images and idols (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+27%3A15">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>); those that are involved in witchcraft and the occult (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+18%3A10-12">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>); sodomites (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Leviticus+18%3A22">Leviticus 18:22</a>); murderers (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Prov.+6%3A16-17">Prov. 6:16-17</a>); and the proud (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+16%3A5">Proverbs 16:5</a>). God mentions that these are <b>all abominations to Him</b> in the Bible. Did you see what kind of people? Sodomites! Why would a woman wearing slacks be linked with sodomites? Well, what is a man called when he dresses (or acts) in a feminine way? It can lead to sodomy. Cross dressing or unisex clothing blurs the separation between sexes that God desires. This &#8220;line of thinking&#8221; really grabbed our attention and grieved our hearts!</p>

<p>In Jeremiah we learn something about what our attitude should be toward what God calls abominable, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+6%3A15" title="Jeremiah 6:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Jeremiah 6:15)</span></a></span> Israel had no shame for her sins. If our heart is clothed with humility, will we not be ashamed and blush when God shines the light of His Word on our lives and we see that we have need of repentance? We are to exhort one another <span class="scripture">&#8220;while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+3%3A13" title="Hebrews 3:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 3:13)</span></a></span> Oh, how careful we must be, sin deceives and hardens our hearts! We need the Word of God in our hearts to keep us from sin and as we esteem it, it will guide us in the way that is right. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee&#8230;. Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+119%3A11%2C128" title="Psalm 119:11,128"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 119:11,128)</span></a></span></p>

<h3>Excuses We Use</h3>
<p>Many excuses sound spiritual at first, like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not a legalist. I have liberty in Christ.&#8221; Are we explaining away our obligations to obey the Word of God? A legalist is not a person who is following the Bible and living a separated, holy life. A legalist is in reality a person who is keeping the law for salvation, a person who is saving himself by his own works. Liberty in Christ? Of course, but our Savior set us free <i>from</i> sin, not setting us free <i>to</i> sin. <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+6-8">Romans 6 through 8</a> show us plainly that we are to live holy &#8220;unto the Lord&#8221; and be pleasing to Him.</p>

<p>Many like to be excused from the &#8220;hindrance&#8221; of wearing dresses by saying their life is too active or rough. I will admit that there <i>are</i> some things that we can&#8217;t do in a dress, but those things are not necessary for us to do (if we&#8217;d be honest). If you have dresses that are long and not too full, you can lead an active life. I have a special friend who is a missionary with her husband and two children. They live in Papua New Guinea, which is a very primitive country. No place for dresses? My friend wears dresses and is able to live a modest life. This young woman walks miles with her husband through the jungle &#8220;bush&#8221; as they reach out to the lost with the Gospel. If she can wear dresses, then there are no excuses for us.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are saying, &#8220;But the Bible says that God looks on the heart, so it doesn&#8217;t matter how I dress.&#8221; <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Samuel+16%3A7">I&nbsp;Samuel 16:7</a> does say, <span class="scripture">&#8220;for the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> looketh on the heart.&#8221;</span> Our Savior does look inside us and knows who and what we truly are, but man doesn&#8217;t. People can&#8217;t see <i>inside</i> us like God can. What man can see is the outward appearance, so we should be peculiar and different from the world&#8230;&#8203;everyone should be able to tell that you are a Christian.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve heard some say, &#8220;But I don&#8217;t <i>feel</i> convicted about <i>that</i>.&#8221; Just because we don&#8217;t &#8220;feel convicted&#8221; about something in the Bible, doesn&#8217;t mean that God changes His Word. I will be honest, there have been some things that I&#8217;ve read in the Bible and have said, &#8220;Ouch! Do I <i>really</i> need to change that in my life, Lord?&#8221; How foolishly we cling to the worldly and fleshly things, and resist God in taking them away from us&#8230;&#8203;the very things that <i>hinder</i> us from becoming even closer to our Savior and more like Him! We must ask ourselves, What is the <i>final authority</i> on what we believe and how we live&#8212;the Bible, or how we &#8220;feel&#8221;? Human feelings are very deceptive (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+14%3A12%3B+Jeremiah+17%3A9">Proverbs 14:12; Jeremiah 17:9</a>). <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+28%3A26">Proverbs 28:26</a> is quite plain in saying, <span class="scripture">&#8220;He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool.&#8221;</span> Follow the Bible, and our lives will reflect Biblical soundness, peace, and God&#8217;s blessings. Follow our emotions, and our lives will be subject to destruction, confusion, and <span class="scripture">&#8220;every wind of doctrine.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+4%3A14" title="Ephesians 4:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 4:14)</span></a></span>.</p>

<p class="first">Now let us realize that the teaching of conscience in the New Testament covers only things which are entirely neutral in principle and involve no moral principle of right or wrong at all.

<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+8%3A8">I&nbsp;Corinthians 8:8</a>
that if we eat, we are no better and if we eat not, we are no worse. This covers a principle that should be applied and carried through all consideration of conscience matters. It applies only to things of an entirely neutral nature which would neither make one better nor worse either way. If it goes beyond this into something which involves moral principles of right and wrong, then we are to be governed by God&#8217;s Word and not by our conscience or what we think about it.</p>


<p>There has been a great cry in recent years for liberty of conscience. But let us realize that this tendency generally runs into a liberal conscience, and there is a vast difference between a liberal conscience and liberty of conscience. But God has talked to me some in times past on the text in
<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+5%3A1">Galatians 5:1</a>,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Stand fast therefore the the liberty wherewith Christ hath made [you] free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.&#8221;</span>
People today are contending for a great many liberties which Christ did not give them. He has never, at any time, liberated you and me from the obligations of His Word and the standard it sets forth. All He has done in that respect, at the best, is to just be patient and merciful and long-suffering with us and allow us time to get to the standard and get straightened out in our conscience and light, etc. But if we would not try to get to it but just contended for our own &#8220;think-so&#8221; in it, His patience, long-suffering and forbearance would run out on us and we would be cut off. The liberty Christ gave us was never liberty to follow our own conscience alone as a standard of holiness and spiritual life. Many other liberties which people contend for and with which people do not want to be interfered are liberties Christ did not make them free in, also.</p>

<p>God has never given to you and me free license to follow any questionable thing, even slightly, but has instructed us to
<span class="scripture">&#8220;abstain from all appearance of evil.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+5%3A22" title="I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:22)</span></a></span>
The more we do this, the fuller and richer and more complete our spiritual lives will be and the more God&#8217;s blessings will abound in our souls. Brother Fred Pruitt and I were together in a meeting in Minnesota some years ago, and were staying in the home of a man who was pastor of the congregation where the meeting was being held. This man was accused to us by some of the members of his congregation that he drank beer. Brother Pruitt talked to him about it, and he never said if he did or did not, but his answer was that the Bible said to be temperate in all things, and that would include drinking beer the same as anything else, and one could not be condemned for drinking beer if he were temperate in it. But the liberties Christ gave never extended to such things as this, and He does not grant us license to indulge in any evil thing even temperately.</p>

<p>There seems to be a great fear with some of our people today with respect to extremism. I know there is such a thing and I fear it, too, to a certain extent. But I feel there is not much widespread danger of it within our ranks. There is much more danger of compromise among us at this time than of extremism and fanaticism as I see it. Those who are a little on the liberal side anyway seem especially fearful of fanaticism, but I certainly feel this is a trick of the devil to get their focus on this and pull them into compromise and liberalism to avoid it. It would not be so bad if people who feared extremism so much would fear compromise just as much and religiously steer away from both of them. But it is not usually this way. I am fully aware that an extreme spirit can never be satisfied. But neither can a compromise spirit; but when given way to, it will demand more and more and yet more, never being satisfied.</p>

<h2>A Brother&#8217;s Testimony</h2>
<p>The first time I ever saw this young woman was when she started a job of cleaning a business place. She was modestly attired and had a pleasant, sunny disposition, with a good spirit about her. I wondered why she was working. Surely, a woman attired as she would not work unless pressed by necessity. I imagined my wife, a godly woman, in circumstances where it was imperitive that she work out in public. Surely, she would conduct herself with that godly dignity, that respectable attire, that would say to all: &#8220;I am a woman who loves God. I do not wish to work in this way; I would rather be at home. But until the Lord works something else out for me, it is what I have been given to do. It is honorable work, and I am a honorable woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>This young woman&#8217;s outward attire caused me to believe that she was inwardly attired in the same manner. And I saw nothing in her attitude or demeanor to suggest otherwise. So I carried within me an inner respect and appreciation for her stand.</p>

<p>Now I have known a few women/girls who have some of this modest, humble spirit about them which was at odds with the clothing that they wore. But not very many, and not very long. For there is a basic instability when the inside and the outside do not agree. The one works on the other, and eventually one becomes dominant in the individual. This is true of men, also, and applies to things other than outward attire. But it is especially true of womenfolks in general with respect to dress, I think. They are more focused in general on personal appearance by nature.</p>

<p>Months passed by. My business took me frequently to the building that this young woman cleaned, and I often saw her about her duties. She was diligent about her work; the place looked much better than it had under her predecessor. It was good to see her from time to time. Good examples are only too rare in this ignorant and evil world in which we live, and the sight of this young woman, appropriately attired, was a bright spot to observe.</p>

<p>And then, changes began to take place. She switched from skirts and blouses to culottes and split-skirts. It still appeared distinctly feminine, but the over-all effect was a little marred, and I was, a little to my surprise, a little disappointed. She had presented a little more uplifting appearance before, I thought. I was led to meditate a little upon the capacity that we have to inspire each other, whether we are men or women, and how that capacity can be used to inspire others higher or lower.</p>

<p>The freedom that the split-skirts gave her changed her attitude just a little&#8212;so little, indeed, that I think that only individuals deeming these things important would have really noticed. She began to walk a little differently. Her priority was becoming her job values more than her womanly values, and the change that she had made seemed to give her more freedom to bend, stoop, etc., in the performance of her duties. It was not so much that she willed to be different, but a change was taking place, nonetheless.</p>

<p>I have never seen her with an improper attitude or taking part in an improper conversation. The only change I have observed was in her external attire.</p>

<p>A number of months went by, perhaps even a year or longer; I really do not know. But one day, I was startled to see her wearing jeans. No doubt, she feels a freedom now to do her work better than ever, but the work, the so important and vital work that she was doing before, has become neglected. What is that? The work of elevating the relationships between men and women, of upgrading their inner images of each other, of inspiring each other to respect the opposite gender.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Mark+10%3A6" title="Mark 10:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Mark 10:6)</span></a></span></p>

<p>The differences between male and female are myriad and profound. It is our privilege and solemn responsibility to focus on aspects of those differences that are ennobling and inspiring. There is vastly too much attention focused on the fleshly differences between men and women, and the result is a debasing and brutish characterization of the relationship between the genders which is unworthy of what God meant for us to be.</p>

<p>Oh, that all, men and women alike, would be stirred to <span class="scripture">&#8220;walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+4%3A1" title="Ephesians 4:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 4:1)</span></a></span> God created us to live higher and better than most are living. His salvation elevates and lifts up. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And an highzbay shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+35%3A8" title="Isaiah 35:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 35:8)</span></a></span> God has a high way, up above our ways. Behold, <span class="scripture">&#8220;My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+55%3A8" title="Isaiah 55:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 55:8)</span></a></span>. God wants to bring us up to His thoughts, His way of apparel, His way of living.</p>

<p>At one time, I was often around a professed Christian sister who was an immense trial to me. Why? Well, I could not look at her comfortably. Her hair was all chopped off and I felt a sense of shame for her, for, according to the Bible, her glory (as a woman) was gone (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+11%3A15">I&nbsp;Corinthians 11:15</a>). She wore dresses which gaped at the neck at times, insomuch that it would have been immodest to have continued looking at her. I had no desire to look at her (for the Lord has taken that out of me; praise His name!), and would turn my head. She was unconscious of the effect that these things were projecting, and, as I and my wife became more acquainted with her, we found that she did not have an immodest spirit. She had cut her hair, thinking that the less time spent in taking care of it was pleasing to God. Her outside and inside did not agree. The wrong signs were up on the outside. We began to pray for her that she would learn from God to be a true example outwardly as well as inwardly. That she would be fruitful, inwardly and outwardly. Her ignorance was hindering her light (that God had given her) from shining and appearing unto all. God takes care of the inside so that the outside may be as it should, also. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+23%3A26" title="Matthew 23:26"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 23:26)</span></a></span></p>

<p>As you can see, dear reader, <b>the outside does matter</b>.</p>

<p>Suppose I came to your home. I was carrying a machine gun, wearing two pistols, assorted knives, various explosive devices, and a huge machete. And I earnestly entreated you, &#8220;I am really a very peaceful person. I abhor violence. I love everybody and would do no harm to anyone. It is not in my heart to do anything like that. Look at my eyes&#8212;cannot you see the kindly, benevolent light that is shining in them?&#8221; What would you think? Would you say, &#8220;Well, I haven&#8217;t seen him actually do any harm to anyone&#8230;&#8203;so I must not judge him&#8230;. Maybe he does have a very gentle heart.&#8221; Or would you be inclined to ask me what I was doing with all those weapons?</p>

<p>I note that Lot was vexed with the <i>seeing</i> as well as the hearing of the filthy conversation and unlawful deeds of the unrighteous (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+2%3A7-8">II&nbsp;Peter 2:7-8</a>).</p>

<p>If you are modest and humble inside with a meek and quiet spirit, I beg of you to let it shine out to the glory of God. Dispense of everything that would hinder it. Pray until you know that the Lord has His approval of you in every way, inside and out. Let Him cover you.</p>

<p>If you are plain within, but ornamented without&#8212;humble within, but proud without; modest and retiring within, but a hoyden without&#8212;then seek Him who is able to make holy both body and spirit. Knock as one who desires what God has to give. Oh, get delivered from the double mind and find the precious stability that He has for your life (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+1%3A8">James 1:8</a>).</p>

<p>I anm glad to report that the sister who had a heart to live for God learned the way of the Lord more perfectly (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+18%3A26">Acts 18:26</a>). It is a great blessing to be able to talk with her comfortably. I am perfectly aware that she is a woman, a godly woman, but her womanliness is not portrayed in such a way as to be a distraction to spiritual conversation.</p>

<p>I would to God that all men and all women everywhere lived in such purity and godly understanding before God that their relationships were all wholesome, profitable, and edifying. I&#8217;m sorry that they don&#8217;t. What a better world this would be if all would take this to heart and live, inwardly and outwardly, as they should.</p>

<h2>A Conclusion</h2>
<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>What is modesty? What is the underlying principle in being what is termed &#8220;modest&#8221;? Is it in dressing a certain way or having your dresses and skirts a certain length or a certain style? Is that really what makes you modest? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>

<p>Have you ever been to the library or store and seen someone who, by outward appearances, looks modest? I have and I&#8217;ve also noticed that some of them, young and old, do not conduct themselves in a modest way. Outside they have the appearance of a godly person, but inside they are far cry from modesty.</p>

<p>So, if modesty isn&#8217;t just the way we dress&#8212;what is it?!</p>

<p>I believe modesty is a combination of two things: contentment and obedience. The sense of modesty is being content with how God made you. Many people who defend pants accuse us of having &#8220;holier-than thou&#8221; attitudes or being fanatical because we believe that to be modest, we must wear dresses. <span class="scripture">&#8220;The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman&#8217;s garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> thy God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+22%3A5" title="Deuteronomy 22:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Deuteronomy 22:5)</span></a></span> There is a principle to this law. <span class="scripture">&#8220;So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+1%3A27" title="Genesis 1:27"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Genesis 1:27)</span></a></span> There is a distinct difference between men and women. We were made differently. We think differently. Our places in life are different. We are women&#8212;not by accident, but on purpose. God has a special place for us, as He has for men; each has places that are unique and purposeful alike, but in different ways. Are you willing to accept that? Are you willing to accept your role as a woman and all that goes with that? God made us women and our clothing should fit with our roles that God designed for us.</p>

<p>Modesty is not just wearing certain styles of clothing. Modesty begins in the heart of the child of God, and I want to stress that God cares infinitely more about the condition of the heart. However, if you are saved and there is nothing between you and God, your heart will naturally desire to please God in every area of life. This is how it was with me.</p>

<p>Before the Lord changed my heart, I held on tightly to my pants. Aunt Krista and Uncle Rick required me to wear dresses outside the home, which I did, but I still had my pants in the closet. I wouldn&#8217;t give them up. However, after I was made a new creature in Christ, I willingly and eagerly gave up my pants, my makeup, my jewelry&#8212;all the things that belonged to my old man. All the outward baggage that I used to hide my identity under. And indeed they did show who I was on the inside insecure, unsure of myself, discontent with how I looked, hungry for things to make me look pretty.</p>

<p>Our clothing shows our outward appearance and who we are on inside. It shows our attitudes, our heart condition, and who we are. I recently went into a small store and saw another lady there with a very short skirt on. When I saw her I thought, &#8220;Her clothing shows what she is inside!&#8221; Dressed to draw attention to herself and be attractive to men, she had an immodest heart.</p>

<p>How does our clothing testify of us? Does it speak of a pure and modest heart within? Or does it hint of a vain and proud heart? What is on the inside will speak of the outside.</p>

<p>I want to mention that there are people who are pure and modest in their hearts, yet not measured up in this area of modesty. But again, what is on the inside will come out. A proud heart will say, &#8220;Well, God hasn&#8217;t convicted me yet!&#8221; Whereas a humble, modest heart will say, &#8220;I am willing to do whatever the Lord wants. I am waiting for Him to show me what His standard is.&#8221; Be open, dear sisters, to what God has for you. No matter how hard it will be to give up something, God will reward you abundantly for the sacrifice and obedience to Him.</p>

<p>Many women today have complained that men don&#8217;t treat them as they should. Men take advantage of them, or there isn&#8217;t any more of that old-fashioned gallantry. Perhaps if ladies would be in their place, and not in men&#8217;s, the men would respect them and treat them as they should. I once heard of a woman who, if she waits long enough, has had even the toughest looking truck driver open the door for her. This person was being the woman God called her to be, which causes men to be who they are called to be. I have found that even some rough young men will be extremely polite to those who are dressed in a quiet way. Those same young men will act awful with other young ladies who are dressed much like the young men.</p>

<p>Sadly, many women today are aware that men are visually-oriented. Accordingly, most women out in the world today dress in a way to attract men to themselves. As daughters of the King, are we supposed to dress in a way that will be a stumbling block for a brother in Christ? I beseech you to check your wardrobe and pray that there is nothing in your closet that will cause another to sin.</p>

<p>One lady talked about the spirit of modesty as if it were a peach. Over a peach is a soft, fine, skin of lovely fuzz, protecting the peach from outside dangers&#8212;it is the peach&#8217;s covering of modesty. It is beautiful and becoming to the peach. But once the skin is broken, the modesty taken off, all you can see is the bold luster of the peach. Soon the peach will spoil without it s covering of &#8220;modesty.&#8221; We too will &#8220;spoil&#8221; without our covering of modest clothing.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are thinking, &#8220;but I just can&#8217;t believe in all this. I love being able to ride horses with the freedom jeans give. I don&#8217;t know how to sew. Besides I dislike sewing and I know I could never have the patience to sew myself a dress. And it takes up too much time&#8230;&#8203;I never have enough time anyway&#8230;. God looks at our hearts&#8230;.&#8221; Yes, dear reader, God looks at our hearts. He looks down and sees the unsurrendered part of your heart that clings tightly to your own ways and reasoning&#8230;&#8203;and He longs to change you. He longs for you to want to let Him shine supremely through you. He wants to give you a heart that says, &#8220;Yes, Lord, I will go all the way. I will wear what you want me to, even though I didn&#8217;t think You really cared.&#8221;</p>

<p>I think it is profitable to dwell a little on the argument that God does not care about our apparel. A good father cares about his children&#8212;he wants them fed properly, he is concerned with the friends they play with. All things that concern his child concern him too. So it is with our Heavenly Father. Our Heavenly Father is concerned with all aspects of His children&#8217;s lives. If a child wears a thin swimsuit in the dead of winter, a most unpractical thing to do, her action reflects on her parents&#8230;&#8203;who let her do such a thing? So, again, it is with us. Anyone should be able to look at us and say, &#8220;Who lets you do that?&#8221; Or, &#8220;Why do you dress like that?&#8221; And we should be able to answer, &#8220;Our Heavenly father commanded us to; and we love to obey Him.&#8221; Someone told me once, &#8220;But I don&#8217;t love to obey the commandment to wear modest apparel.&#8221; Dear reader, if you feel that way, God can change your heart so that you will long to please Him in every aspect of your life.</p>

<p>Consider the testimony of this sister: &#8220;After I had seen the Word of God teach that I should wear modest clothing, I wanted to obey, yet loved wearing pants. I really struggled with trying to obey and finally cried out to God, &#8216;Oh, Lord, please make it easy for my to obey Your commands.&#8217; The Lord changed my heart and indeed made it easy for me to love to wear modest clothing.&#8221; This dear sister found the sweetness in following God&#8217;s commands, though she also adds that she didn&#8217;t entirely understand why God asked her to wear those certain clothes.</p>

<p>The example of an earthly father and child come again to mind. A child cannot see the dangers of playing on the busy street&#8230;&#8203;but the father can. Perhaps we cannot see the dangers of not being properly covered in such a (seemingly) small matter of dress. But our Heavenly Father does. He sees the large &#8220;cars&#8221; ready to run us down as we dangerously play out on the street&#8230;. A child cries at the restraint put on him; the street is such an interesting place&#8212;there is so much freedom there. But the wise father knows the dangers and does not allow him to do as he naturally would. By and by, the child also sees the dangers and is glad; he is now happy he obeyed his father and loves him all the more for his protection. It is the same with our Heavenly Father and His infinite love toward us.</p>

<p>With the subject of modesty, it may not be always easy to obey our all-wise Heavenly Father. His standards may seem unreasonable. Wait. Trust in the Lord, obey Him, and by and by, you will see the dangers and be glad you obeyed. I remember a time I wanted so much to have a horse. There were horse barns near us where you could rent a horse and a stable, and oh, how much I wished that my mother would allow me to rent a horse there. But my mother knew that the people there were very ungodly and I would have to spend time with them, alone, cleaning the stables and taking lessons from them. She refused my pleas and I had to submit and obey. For many years I did not understand&#8230;&#8203;slowly things began to unfold and I saw the dangers&#8230;. Recently I thanked my mother for holding the line and not allowing me to do what I naturally wanted.</p>

<p>Does it seem hard to simply trust? Will you take the alternative? Will you defy the Father&#8217;s plan and, as the songwriter says,</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Do you love the world, in its pomp and show?<br />In its course of sin will you onward go?<br />Is the pride of life more than heav&#8217;n above?<br />Will you lose your soul for the sins you love?&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Do_You_Love_the_World/index.html" title="Do You Love the World?">*</a></p>

<p>Dear sister, please, do not count anything as more worthwhile than simply obeying the Father&#8217;s commands. I cannot help but think of the young woman, Judith, who embraced Christianity, and lost everything&#8212;her home, family, fiance, and life. Through it all, though, she felt that obeying the Lord was worth it all and gladly suffered for His sake. I cannot help but feel that wearing our natural garments that modestly cover us, as ladies, is a very small sacrifice in comparison, however big it may seem. Let us yield all to the Lord, sisters, even though we may not see the whole picture.</p>

<h1>The Man of My Counsel</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>I have a burden upon my heart that I want to share with you, and I pray that the Lord would do <span class="scripture">&#8220;exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+3%3A20" title="Ephesians 3:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 3:20)</span></a></span> in blessing this to the encouragement of your hearts.</p>

<p>This year, for my 17th birthday, I received a beautiful KJV Thompson Chain Reference Bible. My eyes glowed when I saw it and I pronounced it my favorite gift. In the days that followed, when I began to eagerly read from my new Bible, the Lord began to speak to my heart. While I thought I was loving to read my Bible because it was God&#8217;s Holy Word, He showed me that I was in love with the beauty and newness. It was then that I began to pray more earnestly that I would love the Bible for it&#8217;s <i>truth</i> much more than the external looks&#8230;&#8203;that I may take it for the Man of my Counsel.</p>

<p>I read a little excerpt from a book which shows a good picture of what the Bible should mean to us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">A tourist asked at the service station the way to a certain town. The directions were carefully given. The tourist said, &#8220;You think this is the best way, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The service man replied, &#8220;It is not only the best way, but it is the only way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bible is the only way to heaven. Do you live to all it teaches every day?</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Do you love God&#8217;s Word, dear sisters? Do you love it because it is God&#8217;s words spoken through lips of clay, preserved to show us the way? If you were all sitting in front of me and were to raise your hands in yes to the question, I have no doubt that almost all hands would be raised. However, in this little article I&#8217;d like to share with you different aspects of God&#8217;s Word and challenge you to love it with a greater depth yet.</p>

<h3>The Bible Is True</h3>
<p>The first ingredient in loving God&#8217;s Holy Book is faith; we must first reach out in faith, believing that what He says is true. My brothers are not believers and whenever we mention anything about the Bible, the usual retort is, &#8220;How do you know it is true?&#8221; or &#8220;What if it is just all made up?&#8221;</p>

<p>We know that it is true because we have experienced the Royal birth the blood-washed, heart-changed life. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+119%3A160" title="Psalm 119:160"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 119:160)</span></a></span> It has been tried and tested and proven true all down through the ages since the time of the apostles and <span class="scripture">&#8220;the word of our God shall stand forever.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+40%3A8" title="Isaiah 40:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 40:8)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Yet&#8230;&#8203;do we sometimes go around on the overly-confidant path? Are there things in your life that God has been convicting you about that you like to push aside and forget? It is sad to say, but nonetheless true, that many people today have their own gospels. They pick and choose from the Word of God and live according to the desires of the flesh. Oh sisters, God grieves to see this. We&#8217;re to live by <span class="scripture">&#8220;every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+4%3A4" title="Matthew 4:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 4:4)</span></a></span> not by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God that we like, or which the world seems to promote.</p>

<h3>The Bible Is Our Guide</h3>
<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+4%3A1" title="I&nbsp;John 4:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 4:1)</span></a></span></p>

<p>There are many false prophets today and many winds of doctrine floating about. Many are confused, but the Lord has made sure that there is a way out of the fog.</p>

<p>A plumb bob, or plummet, is a piece of lead or weight attached to a plumb line, used for accuracy in carpentry to measure or level things straight up and down. The Word of God is the Christian&#8217;s plumb bob.</p>

<p>As a family, we&#8217;ve been reading a book called <a href="../../../texts/The_Man_of_His_Counsel/index.html" title="The Man of His Counsel">The Man of His Counsel</a>, and I want to quote a little part of it for you. The main characters of the story, Joe and Susie Holmier, at a certain part of the narrative, were living a life pleasing before the Lord and were walking in all the light He had given them. At one point in the story, their little boy was very sick and they had nowhere to turn; the doctor, as they discovered that morning, was drunk and they couldn&#8217;t place their trust in him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">At this Joe picked up the Bible which lay on the table in the room and said, &#8220;There is but one thing to do, and that is to see what the Book says for us to do. You know we have taken it as <i>the man of our counsel</i>, and there must be something in it now that will tell us what to do at this time.&#8221;</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[Williams, Effie M.; <a href="../../../texts/The_Man_of_His_Counsel/index.html"><i>The Man of His Counsel</i></a>, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/The_Man_of_His_Counsel/Answered_Prayer/index.html">Answered Prayer</a>&#8221;]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>They took the Bible as their ultimate guide and the Lord was faithful to shed light on their pathway. Are you confused, perplexed or don&#8217;t understand? Take <i>everything</i> to the Word of God and measure it to see whether it be of God or man. If it doesn&#8217;t line up to our Plumb Bob, then we know that it isn&#8217;t truth.</p>

<p>What better guide do we have than the Word of God? We cannot go wrong if we bring everything and measure it to the Bible.</p>

<h3>The Bible Satisfies the Hungry</h3>
<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+5%3A3" title="Matthew 5:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 5:3)</span></a></span></p>

<p>In thinking about this scripture, the woman with the issue of blood came to mind (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+9%3A20">Matthew 9:20</a>). She had spent all her money going to different doctors and searching for cures until, finding nothing, she gave up. Then she heard about Jesus, the great Physician and said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+9%3A21" title="Matthew 9:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 9:21)</span></a></span></p>

<p>This woman came to the end of her rope; she had no where else to turn and I think the best way to describe her would be <span class="scripture">&#8220;poor in spirit.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>The Lord delights in us when we are poor in spirit; when we&#8217;ve come to an end of ourselves. I believe He looks down with joy on those who are hungering and thirsting after righteousness&#8230;&#8203;and He&#8217;s promised that they shall be filled.</p>

<p>Remember the Israelites in the wilderness? I wouldn&#8217;t say that they were hungering and thirsting after God, but He was faithful nevertheless to provide manna every morning. The Lord is just as willing to give us our daily bread as He was back then, only it is not earthly food, but spiritual, fulfilling substance that leaves nothing lacking.</p>

<p>I hear of many girls who struggle with getting up early enough to spend time with God. Indeed I, too, struggled with it for a long time and occasionally slept in instead of getting up if I really need the rest. However, the Lord has answered my prayers for more hunger. Many times when I wake up in the morning, I have a strong desire from the Lord to draw close to Him to gain the Heavenly Manna that will carry me through the day.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t have a strong desire to read from His Word, ask God. Seek and knock till the doors are open. God has precious things for you in His Word, if only you will make it a priority and follow after it until you are satisfied.</p>

<h3>The Bible Hid in the Heart</h3>
<p>For the practical side of this article, I wanted to express how very important it is to memorize the Word of God, <span class="scripture">&#8220;that [we] might not sin against thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+119%3A11" title="Psalm 119:11"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 119:11)</span></a></span> However, it is even more important that we ask the Holy Spirit to write His Word into our hearts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">To live holy lives we must have God&#8217;s Word in both mind and heart. The same hand that writes it in the heart also writes it in the mind. Studying the Bible is good, but not sufficient. What we read in the Book, we must have written in the mind by the Holy Spirit, or it will profit us little or nothing. The Holy Spirit never writes God&#8217;s law in the mind except He writes them in the heart also. When written in the heart, man obeys.</p>

<p class="citation"><span>[Orr, Charles E.; <a href="../../../texts/Helps_to_Holy_Living/index.html"><i>Helps to Holy Living</i></a>, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Helps_to_Holy_Living/Gods_Law_in_Mans_Mind_and_Heart/index.html">God&#8217;s Law in Man&#8217;s Mind and Heart</a>&#8221;]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>As a family we&#8217;ve read many true story accounts about men and women who have shone as lights even though they didn&#8217;t have Bibles. Others have been thrown into prison or all their Bibles have been burned or forbidden. It may not be that America will become as bad, but there are times when we&#8217;ll need it in our hearts even though we have plenty of Bibles at hand.</p>

<p>Recently, an older sister who lives on her own shared how a man came to her door at night. She didn&#8217;t dare open the door, and when he wouldn&#8217;t go away, she was afraid he might break in. The Lord was faithful to her in the situation and didn&#8217;t leave her or forsake her. She went into an adjoining room and started earnestly praying. The Lord brought to her mind the scripture, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+26%3A3" title="Isaiah 26:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 26:3)</span></a></span> She trusted in her Lord, and He took all fear away from her and the man went away.</p>

<h3>The Bible Is God&#8217;s Word to Us</h3>
<p>That may sound a little funny, or like it could be grouped together with another subtitle, but I want to talk about how God communicates to us through His Word.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I feel it is so important to spend time each day in the Word, is because it is God&#8217;s communicator. We conununicate with God by prayer; He answers, most commonly, through His Word.</p>

<p>Not too long ago, I was facing a lot of discouragement and I felt like Paul&#8212;troubled on every side. Temptations were right before me and I prayed for God to show me what to do to get the victory.</p>

<p>Just at that time, while I happened to be separating the pages of my new Bible, I stopped at a certain point and happened to look down at the page.</p>

<p>The Lord had answered my prayer and brought before me the story of Tamar and her brother Amnon, the children of David (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Samuel+13">II&nbsp;Samuel 13</a>). Amnon had sinned before the Lord and against his sister and in the end he was killed by his brother Absalom. The Lord used that illustration to show me what I needed to do to get rid of the temptations&#8212;I needed to slay the source of the temptation.</p>

<p>Often in the morning, when I come before the Lord to meditate on His Word, I pray, &#8220;0 God, if you want me to understand Your Word, please give me ears to hear and anoint my eyes to read and comprehend all that You have for me.&#8221; I have learned that unless our hearts are completely open and God removes the veil from off our eyes, we cannot properly understand the Word of God. We must be led and inspired by the Holy Spirit when reading from the Bible, lest we cleave to error, thinking that it is truth.</p>

<p>Oh, my precious sisters, I exhort you to live up to your privileges that the Bible speaks about. God&#8217;s Word is so precious&#8212;don&#8217;t take it for granted. Love it, cherish it, and be wholly guided by it alone.</p>

<h1>Finding Him Faithful</h1>

<h2 class="subtitle">Meet Two Princesses: Fairlight and Claire Meyer</h2>
<hr class="minor" />
<h2>Please tell us about yourselves, your goals, interest, and values.</h2>
<p class="noindent"><b>Claire:</b> My name is Claire Elizabeth Meyer; I was born (delivered by my daddy) on June 12, 1982. I&#8217;m generally a quiet person (although not when Mommy, Fairlight, and I are talking late into the night&#8230;&#8203;which we do with astounding regularity)&#8230;&#8203;probably a phlegmatic, for those ofyou who are into personality types. I think my spiritual gift is mercy.</p>

<p>Daddy and Mommy came to Christ when I was about two&#8230;. I&#8217;m so thankful to have been raised in a Christian family. I love the words to the hymn &#8220;I Know Whom I Have Believed,&#8221; by Daniel W. Whittle: &#8220;I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I&#8217;ve committed unto Him against that day.&#8221;</p>

<p>I really like to write poetry and sometimes stories. Actually, I would probably write a lot more stories if didn&#8217;t get so hung up on research&#8230;. History isn&#8217;t exactly my thing, but I rarely think of stories that can be set in modern times! I also like art; since I&#8217;ve been working on <i>HopeChest</i>, that&#8217;s mostly been applied to doing graphic design.</p>

<p>I like all sorts of sewing and needleworkish things&#8230;&#8203;although I&#8217;m afraid most of my cross-stitches end up buried half-done in my project box in the attic. A friend of mine got me started on crocheting a number of years ago; since then, I&#8217;ve made two baby afghans for my hope chest (or hope drawer, actually&#8212;it currently occupies the bottom drawer of the dresser Fairlight and I share, plus a couple of boxes in the attic). Lately I&#8217;ve been doing some thread crochet, which has turned out to be really fun&#8230;&#8203;I would like such an impractical hobby!</p>

<p>A couple of years ago God provided us with a piano&#8212;a church in town was giving it away&#8212;and with a good friend to give us lessons. I&#8217;ve really been enjoying learning to play it&#8230;&#8203;It&#8217;s an old upright and definitely has its quirks, hence a new hobby&#8212;piano tuning and repair.</p>

<p>Mommy and Daddy have grown vegetables&#8212;and had flower beds in the front yard&#8212;for almost as long as I can remember. I was never very interested in gardening, though, until I studied botany last year and saw for the first time the incredible intricacy of plants&#8230;&#8203;since then I&#8217;ve been hooked. I love flowers and have been exploring the possibility of growing specialty cut flowers on a small scale. This year most of my planning focuses on a small experimental patch of those in the garden. (Two highly-recommended books for the gardeners among you: From <i>Seed to Bloom</i>, by Eileen Powell is a mainstay if you like to start your own plants from seed, and Lynn Byczynski&#8217;s <i>The Flower Farmer</i> is a beautiful book for anyone interested in growing specialty cuts.)</p>

<p>As far as my goals for the future, I want most of all God&#8217;s will for my life&#8230;. I would love for that to include mission work, marrying, and raising children.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Fairlight:</b> My full name is Fairlight Rebecca Meyer, and I&#8217;ll be 21 on March 29&#8230;. Perhaps I could best describe myself by telling you where I&#8217;m most often found: either typing furiously at the computer, or standing in the kitchen swathed in an apron and perusing a cookbook. I love to work with words&#8212;or at least, I love reading about writing and talking about writing, and sometimes even doing it. I spend a lot of time at the computer, whether tinkering with an article for <i>HopeChest</i> (the magazine for Christian young ladies we&#8217;ve been publishing for seven years), writing a letter to one of many wonderful, long-distance friends, or battling through a story or what wants to be a poem.</p>

<p>But when I&#8217;ve gotten thoroughly <i>tired</i> of words and want something more tangible, I abandon the computer for a cookbook. Since I started making some of our family&#8217;s meals a coupl years ago, and discovered just how much I enjoy experimenting in the kitchen, I&#8217;ve been checking out stacks of cookbooks from the library and am forever trying something new.</p>

<p>Besides those things, I very much enjoy sewing&#8212;I was at Mommy&#8217;s elbow, watching her sew, from the time I could toddle, and spent many childhood days outfitting my dolls in motley creations put together from scraps and liberal amounts of stick-on velcro. Over the years I&#8217;ve been hired from time to time to sew for a friend or teach sewing (which was not my strong suit&#8212;I&#8217;m far too prone to say, &#8220;Oh, here, let me just do it!&#8221;); I used to make softsculpture dolls, and I sew some of what I wear; but baby clothes are really my favorites to dream up and put together. We all like to do things with our hands, so I&#8217;ve dabbled in most arts and crafts at one point or another&#8212;but they seldom fit into the schedule now except right before Christmas, when I take to frantically basket-weaving or wreath-making, cross-stitching or miniature-making or some such, for gifts.</p>

<p>Mommy&#8217;s read aloud to us at night for as long as I can remember, and so I&#8217;ve loved to read since I learned how. A mixed blessing&#8212;(I also wasted great quantities of my childhood buried in pulp fiction.) I appreciate Amy Carmichael&#8217;s depth and poetry, Elisabeth Elliot&#8217;s clarity and insight, A. W. Tozer&#8217;s crispness and vision, and Elizabeth Prentiss&#8217;s reality and encouragement&#8230;. How grateful I am for writings like theirs to help lift my eyes to things above when my vision has gotten so muddied by tangled thoughts and feelings and problems!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m 5&#8217;4&#8221; or so, and get my looks from my daddy&#8217;s German ancestry, with long, very straight, brown hair that I wear up and hazel eyes framed by wire-rimmed glasses. My spiritual gift is exhorting, and I tend to be reserved, perfectionist, orderly, and intense. I revel in long conversations, brilliant fall days, reason, beautiful things, productivity, and babies to cuddle.</p>

<p>I can see myself spending my future either as a wife and mother or tending orphans in some foreign country, and writing while I do either thing, but I really don&#8217;t know yet what the Lord has in store. He has been teaching me more and more these past few years that what I really need isn&#8217;t to know my next steps or be able to see the reasons for His plan, as much as I long for those sometimes. What I <i>really</i> need is an overpowering love for Him and great trust in His will&#8212;that my every heart-beat, every breath, every action is for Him and not for myself. How pitifully far I am from this yet! I get so distracted by other things, so impatient, so cold sometimes&#8230;&#8203;but <span class="scripture">&#8220;let us lift up our hearts with our hands unto God in the heavens.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Lamentations+3%3A41" title="Lamentations 3:41"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Lamentations 3:41)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+55%3A2" title="Isaiah 55:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 55:2)</span></a></span> I&#8217;m slowly beginning to see the incredible value of what He offers: for our surrender of the dross so dear to us, He promises His gold&#8212;the treasure of Him who is All in All, Him Without Whom Is Nothing. <span class="scripture">&#8220;O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land&#8230;. Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+63%3A1%2C3" title="Psalm 63:1,3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 63:1,3)</span></a></span></p>

<h2>Please tell us about your family.</h2>
<p class="noindent"><b>Both:</b> Daddy (Edwin Walter Meyer III really, but no one ever calls him that&#8212;just &#8220;Ed&#8221;!) was a builder when we were little, an aircraft mechanic for most of our growing-up years, and is now back to building, running his own remodeling business since his employer closed their base here last spring. Daddy&#8217;s a quiet man with a host of practical skills, and can fix almost anything, it seems&#8230;. He plays the guitar, likes chocolate pudding, gliders, and sail-boats, is a trustee and teaches children&#8217;s church at our church. Daddy was born in eastern Pennsylvania, the second of four children, but spent most of his childhood near Seattle. He and Mommy met in a health-food store in New Hampshire where they both worked, and came to know the Lord years later when we lived in North Carolina.</p>

<p>Mommy (n&eacute;e Vicki Ann Goff) spent her first four years in Chile, where her father was an engineer. Since her mother suffered from altitude sickness, Mommy spent that time in the care of a Chilean woman, and so spoke only Spanish until her parents got divorced and she returned with her mother to their native South Carolina. There she forgot all her Spanish and spent her childhood stirring up rattlesnake nests with her cousins&#8230;. Her days are filled now with the myriad activities of a homemaker&#8212;ranging from cooking and cleaning to tending farm animals to chasing toddlers and listening to all her older children&#8217;s problems. (What would we ever do without a mother?) Mommy&#8217;s an expert on just about everything Daddy isn&#8217;t, and is famous in our family for what she calls her eight-track mind, evidenced by her interrupting herself frequently to think aloud about something entirely different&#8212;&#8220;I heard the strangest thing on the news today,&#8221; or, &#8220;Claire, did you ever water your drachena?&#8221; Mommy coordinates a bulk food co-op, so every couple of months we have fun sorting out an order that includes everything from brown rice to gourmet jelly beans.</p>

<p>Phil (27) is the eldest in our family, married to Elizabeth (23), and living in Massachusetts, where he teaches sociology at several colleges, and she&#8217;s a social worker at a nursing home. As they come to mind, please pray for Phil and Liz and for our relationship with them! They don&#8217;t profess Christ and aren&#8217;t very open to our faith&#8230;. Those of you with beloved family members who aren&#8217;t believers probably well know the tears this has cost us, and how much we long for the kind of closeness with them that can only come through a common love for Christ. How He has used our relationship with them to refine us and open our eyes to un-Christlike attitudes we never knew we fostered, to test our convictions and make us long to reflect Him rightly to those around us!</p>

<p>Eli (23) is in his first year of graduate school at University of Southern California, studying and teaching marine biology, which he adores. Aside from the world below water, Eli&#8217;s passions are art, gourmet cooking, and guitar. Temperamentally he&#8217;s very much like Daddy and he excels in whatever he puts his hand to&#8212;Mommy&#8217;s often called him her Renaissance Man.</p>

<p>Daniel (18) was delighted to bid his schooling goodbye last year&#8212;his heart has always been outdoors with his animals and hunting and woods-wandering. He&#8217;s working with Daddy, which they both seem to enjoy&#8230;. Besides the outdoors Daniel thrives on people, and spends his hours off work visiting and helping neighboring farmers, going to livestock auctions, and waiting for a call to a fire or crash (he&#8217;s a volunteer firefighter). After Claire&#8217;s birth Daddy and Mommy decided five children was probably enough&#8230;&#8203;but over the years the Lord changed their hearts and gave our whole family a great longing for more little ones, little ones who wouldn&#8217;t go home every evening and weekend like Mommy&#8217;s babysitting children did. We knocked on many doors with no success&#8212;until early in 1995, when a Chicago adoption agency we had contacted called. &#8220;Can you fax us your home study? We have a couple of situations coming up&#8230;.&#8221; For the next weeks we jumped every time the phone rang. Would this be The Call? Somehow we managed to endure the wait until that never-to-be-forgotten phone call when they offered us a tiny baby boy&#8212;and the weeks after that while the interstate adoption paperwork went through, and we hadn&#8217;t even gotten to see a picture of our baby yet! Somehow right up to the end it seemed impossible that what we&#8217;d prayed for daily for about five years would actually be coming to pass. But one beautiful Monday evening in late May, we got to meet Mommy and Daddy at the airport as they stepped off the jet-way with a blanketwrapped bundle, and we became utterly oblivious to everything else in drinking up with our eyes the perfect little stranger we had already fallen in love with&#8230;&#8203;and rejoiced and thanked God every time we looked at sweet Samuel Jesse for months.</p>

<p>Samuel will be four this March. Our &#8220;special-needs&#8221; baby who was born weighing only 3 pounds 11 ounces, and was twice hospitalized for breathing problems before he came to us, has grown up into a lively little boy with a million questions and great aspirations toward leadership.

<p>Remembering how long it had taken to get Samuel, we found a social worker for our next adoption right after his first birthday&#8230;&#8203;and were shocked when two weeks later she told us her agency had a baby girl we might be interested in! Our faithful social worker suffered through near-daily phone calls from us for the next two weeks, and stayed up until eleven working on our revised home study the last night so that we could have our baby in time for Mother&#8217;s Day. When not on the phone with her, we haunted yard sales for baby-girl clothes and dreamed over the photos we&#8217;d been given. It was early on a Friday afternoon in May when our social worker and her husband pulled up in front of our house and we swarmed out to meet 6-week-old Hannah Grace&#8230;&#8203;Hannah, who just blinked at us in confusion for two weeks till she knew her new family, then blossomed into the vibrant, almost-three-year-old fireball who runs all over our house now&#8212;singing (amazingly tunefully, but with whatever words come to mind), getting into mischief, trying to help with whatever cooking is going on, or cuddling one of her beloved ratty flannel bunnies and sucking her thumb.</p>

<p>We live on 20 acres near Roanoke, Virginia, with a big red barn, little white house, and a varying collection of animals. One of its best and worst features is the creek running through ite&#8230;&#8203;Best because we love to cool off in it during the summer, worst because it floods over most of our land about four times a year. We moved here from the Pittsburgh area in June of 1995.</p>

<p class="hedaing">Is there any special blessing from the Lord you&#8217;d like to share?</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Claire:</b> One thing He&#8217;s made me most thankful/or is His divine engineering of my life (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A28">Romans 8:28</a>). As I look back on my life so far&#8212;but especially the almost-three years we&#8217;ve been living here&#8212;I see so many paths I wouldn&#8217;t have chosen if it were up to me to map each detail of my life&#8230;&#8203;but, even with the finite number of reasons I can see, I am so thankful that He chose them for me.</p>

<p>I guess that reminds me that none of the things I smugly think of as &#8220;my accomplishments&#8221; are mine either&#8230;. God has given not only all the ability, all the opportunity, but all the desire, <span class="scripture">&#8220;for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+2%3A13" title="Philippians 2:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 2:13)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New American Standard Bible">NASB</span> It is so comforting, so humbling, to realize that there is a God who is at work in me.</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Fairlight:</b> Undoubtedly two of the greatest blessings the Lord has given me have been my family and my friends, both far-away and nearby. Somehow I suspect I&#8217;m far more prone to express appreciation for my friends&#8217; long, encouraging letters and my siblings&#8217; cheer than my parents, though&#8230;. As we get older and start trying to figure out how we would manage home and family, it&#8217;s so easy to criticize things our parents have done. Yet since God gave us Samuel and Hannah I&#8217;ve been seeing firsthand just how much self-sacrifice and hard work child-rearing involves, and how gladly my parents give it. How much of the richness of my life do I owe to their unceasing efforts (not to mention allowing me to come into the world in the first place)? How much of all that I&#8217;ve learned and done and experienced do I owe to their prayer, their instruction, their not-always-welcome-at-the-time challenges? Thank you, Daddy and Mommy, for everything.</p>

<h2>Would you mind sharing a favorite book, poem, or recipe?</h2>
<p class="noindent"><b>Fairlight:</b> The difficulty will be in deciding which ones! I mentioned some of my favorite inspirational authors above, but I didn&#8217;t tell you about some other books I&#8217;ve been enjoying lately&#8212;Marion Cunningham&#8217;s cookbooks. She edited and revised <i>The Fanny Farmer Cookbook</i>, then compiled <i>The Fanny Farmer Baking Book</i>, <i>The Breakfast Book</i>, and <i>The Supper Book</i>. We&#8217;ve had all four out of the library, and I&#8217;ve had great fun exploring their contents and testing out recipes&#8230;. Unusually enough, all the ones we&#8217;ve tried have worked! She doesn&#8217;t seem to be overly concerned with raising fiber content and lowering fats and sugars, but her recipes are tasty and we&#8217;ve substituted our freshly-ground Golden 86 flour for her all-purpose flour quite successfully.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know how I could ever choose a favorite poem, but I&#8217;ll go for one that you won&#8217;t have to get permission to reprint, and share the words to one of the hymns I&#8217;ve really appreciated:</p>

<p class="verse">Make me a captive, Lord, and then I shall be free.
<br />Force me to render up my sword, and I shall conqueror be.
<br />I sink in lifes alarms when by myself I stand;
<br />Imprison me within Thine arms, and strong shall be my hand.</p>

<p class="verse">My heart is weak and poor until it master find;
<br />It has no spring of action sure, it varies with the wind.
<br />It cannot freely move till Thou has wrought its chain;
<br />Enslave it with Thy matchless love, and deathless it shall reign.</p>

<p class="verse">My power is faint and low till I have learned to serve;
<br />It lacks the needed fire to glow, it lacks the breeze to nerve.
<br />It cannot drive the world until itself be driven;
<br />Its flag can only be unfurled when Thou shalt breathe from heaven.</p>

<p class="verse">My will is not my own till Thou hast made it Thine;
<br />If it would reach a monarchs throne, it must its crown resign.
<br />It only stands unbent amid the clashing strife,
<br />When on Thy bosom it has leant, and found in Thee its life.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8212;George Matheson</p>

<p class="noindent"><b>Claire:</b> Where do I start?!</p>

<p>Two of my favorite books are <i>God&#8217;s Smuggler</i>, by Brother Andrew, and <i>The Family Nobody Wanted</i>, by Helen Doss. I smile as I type this, thinking of what very different books they are: the first the adventure of a Dutchman smuggling Bibles and encouragement to Christians behind the Iron Curtain, the second the story of a minister and his wife and the twelve children they adopted. In a way, though, I guess they aren&#8217;t that different, because both of them are true stories of radical faith&#8230;&#8203;the kind of faith and vision that makes people live a different kind of life. That&#8217;s what I want most of all.</p>

<p>As for a recipe&#8230;. We&#8217;ve made the following cookies several times; they turn out chewy and chocolatey and have a unique taste.</p>

<h3>Chocolate-Cinnamon Crisscrosses</h3>
<ul class="recipe">
<li>1/2 c. butter or margarine</li>

<li>1 c. granulated sugar</li>

<li>2 eggs</li>

<li>1 t. vanilla</li>

<li>1/2 t. cinnamon</li>

<li>2 t. baking powder</li>

<li>2 1/4 c. all-purpose flour</li>

<li>4 oz. semisweet chocolate, melted and cooled</li>

<li>granulated sugar</li>

</ul>
<p>In a large mixing bowl beat the butter with an electric mixer on medium to high speed until softened. Add the 1 c. sugar, baking powder, and cinnamon and beat until combined. Beat in the melted chocolate, eggs, and vanilla. Beat in as much oftheflouras you can with the mixer. Using a wooden spoon, stir in any remaining flour. Cover and chill the dough for 1 to 2 hours or until easy to handle. Shape dough into 1&#8221; balls. Place 2&#8221; apart on an ungreased cookie sheet. Using the tines of fork dipped in additional sugar, flatten balls to about 1/2&#8221; thickness by pressing the fork in 2 directions to form crisscross marks. Bake in a 375&deg; oven for 8 to 10 minutes or until edges are set. Cool on cookie sheet for 1 minute. Remove cookies from cookie sheet and cool on a wire rack. Place in an airtight container and store at room temperature for up to three days. Makes about 48. (From the <i>Better Homes and Gardens Complete Book of Baking</i>)</p>

<h2>In conclusion, is there anything else you&#8217;d like to add?</h2>
<p class="noindent"><b>Fairlight:</b> I know that many of you, like us, tend to find more fellowship faraway than nearby, and it&#8217;s easy to get discouraged and lose your vision for why you live differently, with most of your encouragement coming from such a long distance. Lately the Lord has been impressing on me just how important the little choices we make are&#8212;how everything we do will either make us more like Christ, strengthening us in our walk with Him and our testimony to others&#8230;&#8203;or they will be what Amy Carmichael terms, &#8220;subtle love of softening things, easy choices, weakenings,&#8221; that make it so much more difficult for us to walk with Him, more likely to succumb to temptations and compromises. Don&#8217;t we want His best? Isn&#8217;t what He can give us more valuable than anything else we could seek after? But it&#8217;s so easy to defeat ourselves and our witness through soft compromises with selfishness and worldliness! Please, let&#8217;s continue seeking His will and His ways eagerly, even zealously&#8230;. <span class="scripture">&#8220;For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+64%3A4" title="Isaiah 64:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 64:4)</span></a></span></p>

<h1>The Path of Purity</h1>

<p class="author">Mrs. Carol Faidley</p>

<p>No discussion about love in action would be complete without reference to purity, courtship, and marriage, three closely-linked topics. Assuredly, you have given due consideration to these meaningful matters, all demanding a goodly measure of patience, prayer, and trust. For us whom the Sovereign Lord has richly blessed with children, it is never too soon to begin learning and teaching scriptural truths in these areas. Even those without little ones underfoot or by their side can pray for friends and family and strive to be an example of purity and godliness. We want to overcome the humanistic, immoral influences upon our families of a me-first, entertainment-oriented, romance-mentality generation. To do so, we must do our research! We must be ever vigilant to explain and demonstrate God&#8217;s point of view on love, romance, and relationships&#8230;. long before our young people turn &#8220;sweet sixteen,&#8221; and erroneously equate &#8220;being grown up&#8221; with dating, romance, and intimacy. Perhaps our parents failed us in this arena of adolescence. Is that any excuse for us to keep from doing our part in training our children in God&#8217;s ways? God forbid, may it never be so! If they can internalize scriptural principles and learn from our mistakes, rather than making the same ones themselves&#8230;&#8203;then all the better!</p>

<p>Moral purity is not just a matter of heeding a long list of do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts or refraining from crossing a line called impurity. It begins in the heart and motivates us to move with determination toward a life of holiness and righteousness, no matter what our age. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Who may ascend the hill o fthe Lord? Who may stand in His holy place? He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not lift up his soul to an idol or swear by what is false.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+24%3A3-4" title="Psalm 24:3-4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 24:3-4)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+51%3A10" title="Psalm 51:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 51:10)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;Blessed are the pure in heart,for they will see God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+5%3A8" title="Matthew 5:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 5:8)</span></a></span> Young people today desperately need a Biblical foundation for living and a Christian world view&#8212;especially in this society where the Christian foundations are crumbling and the moral absolutes of right and wrong are made light of or ignored all together.</p>

<p>Purity is not a static condition either, but an ongoing process&#8212;something we have to constantly work on&#8230;&#8203; but how? One pursues a path of purity by seeking God and His wisdom and avoiding situations of temptation in daily life. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+6%3A13" title="Matthew 6:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 6:13)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, He will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+10%3A13" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 10:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 10:13)</span></a></span><span class="script_ver" title="New International Version">NIV</span> <b>The catch is that we have to be dedicated to finding that way out of temptation, and even anticipating it beforehand, so we can avoid evil and even the appearance of evil.</b> In other words, we must support the beliefs and convictions of our heart with our actions in day-to-day living, a plan that takes wisdom, discernment, and integrity, as we test every thought, deed, and motive by the truth and love of Christ.</p>

<p>The Book of Proverbs, God&#8217;s textbook on wisdom, is brimming full to overflowing with wise counsel on how to keep on the paths of righteousness and moral purity. Solomon advises listening and heeding parents&#8217; instruction (for children and young people), guarding our hearts, and staying away from evil. When the rubber meets the road, our walk must back up our talk. Our feet should never take us where our hearts cannot keep us with a clear conscience. Where we go, what we do, what we read or watch, who we choose as friends, what music we listen to, what we do with our free time, and even how we dress and carry ourselves must line up with sound scriptural principles for the Christian life. The more we read and study Proverbs, the more God&#8217;s wisdom becomes a part of us&#8212;and Biblical ethics can influence all our decision-making.</p>

<p>Modesty in how we clothe our bodies and how we interact with people are a real indication of our commitment to God&#8217;s best for us, as well as a measure of our spiritual maturity. Knowing, as women, that a weak point for men is often <span class="scripture">&#8220;the eyes,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+2%3A16" title="I&nbsp;John 2:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 2:16)</span></a></span> we must disregard worldly fads and fashions and purpose to dress in a manner that will adorn the Gospel of Christ. We want to draw attention to our face, where Christ&#8217;s love can shine out, not to our bodies, as the world does. In the majority of social settings today, including church services, it has become increasingly difficult to differentiate Christian women from those of the world, because they dress the same. My dear sisters, this should not be! Design, cut, style, length, snugness of fit, femininity, fabric thickness, and transparency need to be considered in choosing Christ-honoring apparel. Women should dress like women, not men. (And vice versa.)</p>

<p>As with any issue, one can show legalism if the spirit of the law is disregarded and we do not want to err in that way. Yet, I urge you to closely and honestly examine your modesty quotient and testimony to the world. What message are you and your daughters really giving out: &#8220;I&#8217;m a woman of the world and I&#8217;m available,&#8221; or, &#8220;I&#8217;m a child of the King and I&#8217;m not for sale&#8221;? A dear Christian friend was bold enough to challenge me regarding dress over a decade ago, for which I am extremely grateful. I now pass on the challenge to you! As moms, rather than being a stumbling block to our daughters, who imitate and look up to us, and to the men and boys God has brought into our lives, let&#8217;s purpose to choose a better way. Concentrate on developing the inner beauty of Godly character, which is of great worth in God&#8217;s sight, and the outward beauty will become less important.</p>

<p>Begin by prayerfully evaluating and rearranging your wardrobe to promote modesty, discretion, and moral purity. Take time to do a check up periodically, asking the Holy Spirit, our best Teacher, to guide you. Sometimes outfits can be altered to an acceptable level of modesty, but often just have to be replaced. Build up slowly and try to choose shades that are becoming on you, especially your four or five best colors that you can mix and match. Yard sales, thrift shops, consignment stores, or home sewing are all great ways to find conservative clothing and economically expand your wardrobe. Forget current fashions altogether; they are atrocious! The trio of modesty, discretion, and moral purity is woven together in unity and purpose, just as we parents should be with each young person in our home. <span class="scripture">&#8220;A cord of three strands is not easily broken.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ecclesiastes+4%3A12" title="Ecclesiastes 4:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ecclesiastes 4:12)</span></a></span></p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>I was asked some time ago if I would be willing to share my life testimony. That was about two years ago now. I have felt a burden to put down my thoughts from time to time, but the Lord knew I needed more time to work through and better understand His work and guidance in my life. I am no better than anyone else, but also recognize that it is Christ that dwells within me to do anything that is truly worthwhile. It is not easy for me to express myself on paper, but I know the Lord wants to be glorified through His work in my life. The Lord has encouraged my heart that He will do the work for me. I am always so thoroughly encouraged when I read the life of a true saint&#8212;I want to press on to be all that the Lord wants me to be until that day when my eternal crown is won.</p>

<p>When I was about 11 years of age, I was in a place in life where I saw myself as I was, a great sinner before God. He showed me my sinful heart by the actions that I took to please myself and others. I needed Him and the deliverance that He can only give through His Son, Jesus. In simple faith, I turned my life over to Him as I needed to be cleaned from all wickedness that can come to a child before the Lord gets a hold of one&#8217;s life. I took a strong hold of His promise to save to the uttermost and He whispered sweet peace to my troubled soul. My parents faithfully took us to church, but the teaching was often watered down by human reasoning. I was continually aware of God guiding and directing my life, but I did not prosper greatly in my soul. Jesus was always central in my thoughts, and yet I lived by my own strength in many ways. My heart abhorred all evil and the Lord protected me in many ways. I did not understand (as I was not a good reader and did not read the Bible on my own much), the privileges the Lord has for His children, and so I lived under great fear of evil all during my teenage years. It was in my own strength that I tended to live, as I knew not the secret of the Lord being our strength in our weakness. I had many weaknesses, but I grew up in a family that loved me and encouraged me to do well. I guess you would say that I was indirectly very competitive, as I wanted always to do my very best, for I knew this pleased my parents and I wanted their love and approval. Those in authority respected me, but my peers were cruel at times, which I was willing to bear. I came to believe that life goes smoothly for those who do right. I was badly deceived, but the Lord had His way of teaching me the truth.</p>

<p>Later, in high school, I was influenced by the ways our society thought right or good, and it started to affect the way I thought. I was slowly getting indoctrinated by &#8220;the world&#8221; and I knew it not. Satan was not able to move me into rebellion, but he worked hard on building worldly values in my mind. The Lord allowed for me to lose my best friend at this time&#8212;she had her own problems and did not want to associate with me any longer. This was a very hard trial for me to bear. I never lost my love for my dearest of friends, as she was like a close sister to me and our families had done much together as a result. I had prayed for such a friend, and the Lord had answered prayer. Now I had lost someone very precious to my heart. I did not do well under this trial as I soon lost interest in life and became very introspective and later depressed, and it was only by the grace of God that I was able to function at all. I loved to spend time with my family, but both my parents worked and my three younger sisters were active with their own friends. Of all their six children, I was the least inclined to academics as I had difficulty understanding what I read. I always put my best efforts in all that I did, as my parents encouraged me greatly, and so I did well in the school environment.</p>

<p>Soon my high school years were over, and I was expected to go to college. Those were some of the hardest years of my life. It was my parents&#8217; way of pushing me &#8220;out of the nest,&#8221; so to speak. Satan had plans of evil for me, but the Lord had a resource of gems for me to receive from the trials and battles that I faced during the next five years. I never did have a sense of belonging while at college. I loved the Lord, but I suffered greatly from not understanding or knowing that the battles that we face in life are <span class="scripture">&#8220;not against flesh and blood, but against&#8230;&#8203;spiritual wickedness in high places.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+6%3A12" title="Ephesians 6:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 6:12)</span></a></span> At times I knew
that I was not able to think normally, and great distress flooded my soul&#8212;oh, how I cried out to the Lord for help. It was only by the grace of God that I made it through those years. To this day, I can say that the Lord has delivered me out of the snare of the enemy with plans for insanity, as I was nearly there. There are many today that are living in such bondage, not knowing that the Lord has deliverance for them. Instead of the chains that held those that were demonically possessed in the past, today medications are used to help control such ones. There is power in the blood of Jesus to deliver such a one. I have found that it is when we give in to our feelings that Satan can throw us about like chaff in the wind. When we start looking at life through our feelings we begin to look to self rather than to God. We need help from the Lord to use our feelings in the ways that are appropriate (compassion, love, etc.), but it is spiritually damaging to use our emotions to judge our spiritual condition. It was at this time that I started to struggle with my own self-worth as I started to listen to thoughts that were not of the Lord. I had no desire for the normal entanglements of this world after I had gotten saved, but little did I know that I was trapped in the worldly entanglement of self-centeredness. It was at this time that I had heard the term &#8220;let go and let God,&#8221; but all my family training to &#8220;put out my best efforts&#8221; greatly hindered me from getting a hold of this great spiritual truth. The Lord was able to teach me at this time that I truly did need Him. I perhaps had a tendency (in my younger years) to think that others could do better if they only tried. I was put in a place where the Lord could show me differently as I struggled greatly with my appetite. I truly saw that I was no better than anyone else. If I had done well it was only by the grace and mercy of God. Even the fellow that is held in the worst contempt by man&#8212;I could be in his/her place except by the saving grace of God through the precious blood of Jesus.</p>

<p>At this time in my life, when I was sorely tried on all sides, my continual prayer was for the Savior to come soon to take me to my heavenly home. I truly felt like a stranger in this world. I didn&#8217;t feel like I could take much more, but I trusted in His promise that He would not give me more than I would be able to bear. The Lord had so much more for me to learn, and His time was not yet.</p>

<p>As a young teenager, I had dreams of being a missionary in Africa or perhaps a social worker in the States. I didn&#8217;t feel like I was gifted in any way, but I desired to be a godly wife and mother someday. I had no interest in dating around, as I could see that the attitude that went along with it had no blessing from the Lord. I was afraid of making a mistake in marriage. At the end of my college years, I met the first spiritual young man that interested me. He happened to become my new brother-in-law. After visiting and getting to know one another some at my sister&#8217;s wedding, I felt free to correspond in friendship as all us three remaining sisters had planned to do. In nearly a year&#8217;s time, I was encouraged by his parents to come up to visit in their home for several weeks and help work at the local daycare center. His father was an American Baptist minister. His parents liked me and encouraged him to consider me seriously. There were many trials from outside during the next couple of years, but the Lord had put a love for one another in our hearts and we were married after many fiery trials.</p>

<p>My husband and I always wanted to be of service to the Lord and the mission field as our goal made sense, as we both grew up as missionary children overseas (just as having Ishmael made sense to Abraham and Sarah as the way to fulfill God&#8217;s promise of a son). My husband is not one to push things to happen, and as I look back I sure am very thankful to the Lord for such a companion. The Lord never did open that door for us, and this was a sore trial for me from time to time, as I so desired the possibility of serving, along with a sister of mine. The Lord had much different plans for us. Through time, He was finally able to show us that our place was one of consecration, allowing Him to do and work as He willed. We had so many strongholds of the enemy needing to be torn down in our lives. We have discovered that this process of working in us has not been easy, but we can testify that it has been all glorious, as it is our Heavenly Father who is at work, knowing just what needs to be done. His ways always satisfy the soul in the end. It is a way of being tried in the fiery trials of life&#8212;of deep heat and cooling off to remove the dross. There has been much dross to remove as our training was heavily in trusting man and his systems and ideas. At one time, we were living unto God under man&#8217;s wisdom and we weren&#8217;t able to fully know what it meant to trust God and have faith in Him. God has been very patient with us. It has been a long process, as the Lord, in His time and with His mercy, led us step by step away from man&#8217;s ways, and into His glorious truth of holiness and righteousness&#8212;a life filled with His grace to receive victory in life&#8217;s battles. Before, we would experience continual failure and discouragement.</p>

<p>In our early married years, along with little ones to care for, we discovered that we weren&#8217;t properly prepared for the serious job of parenting. Our little blessings knew how to demand, and we knew not how to take charge. We took parenting classes at the church and found the &#8220;methods&#8221; taught were ineffective. We wanted God to teach us and yet we had listened to man for so long that we easily became confused. During these years, we were also searching for others in the church who wanted to live seriously for the Lord. We participated in many small groups to discover that there was very little true spiritual hunger where we fellowshipped. My husband was also actively involved in committees and soon saw the politics of the humanly-organized church. We knew that this was not where we belonged and yet we knew not how to get out. It was not with much boldness that we left this church to search around for the body of Christ. It was a tremendous undertaking, as my husband was a pastor&#8217;s child from a heritage of missionaries and pastors, and we were very involved in the church we attended. The Lord had opened our eyes and we knew we had to leave and the Lord made a way out for us. The next couple of years we experienced and saw much as we studied the Word of God and sought fellowship. It was a rough time for us, as we did not know which way to turn but the Lord was faithful to lead us. My husband&#8217;s eyes were opened when he talked with many of the local pastors, and found many twisted interpretations of God&#8217;s Word. We knew that the Lord never intended for His flock to be scattered, but the enemy of our souls has been very active in working on creating sects or schisms (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+1%3A10">I&nbsp;Corinthians 1:10</a>). The Lord helped us out in our great need. He allowed us to see some very warped things along the way, and protected us from much possible spiritual damage.</p>

<p>The Lord allowed us to meet different folks desiring to follow the Lord, and He allowed us to witness their falling out in different ways when they didn&#8217;t stay in the order of the Lord and under the Holy Spirit. We sure didn&#8217;t want to be led astray, and continued to look to the Lord to find others who were following Him in Spirit and in Truth.</p>

<p>The Lord used this time to show us how we needed to trust in Him and Him alone. He slowly showed us things that we needed to leave off in our lives if we truly did trust Him. In His time, about three years later, I met a family at a weekly home school function that I only partook of for one term. I felt no blessing in the atmosphere of the function itself, but I believe the Lord brought me to this place to meet this godly woman. We had a few times to visit afterwards, and I was blessed in what the Lord had opened up in our conversations. We made plans to meet in our homes together to get to know one another better. This woman pointed out scriptures that the Lord used to stir me in a greater understanding of obedience to Him. The only real teaching that I had received was that of being like Jesus in all I said and did. I knew the stories of Jesus&#8217; life and He had helped me in my heart to love good and hate evil. I soon discovered that there was much more to following Him. I remember that during my teen years, I understood that Christians were to be different than the world, but where I lived, the &#8220;Christians&#8221; didn&#8217;t appear to be any different than other self-righteous people. This had truly perplexed me at the time. I had let go of knowing what this spiritual truth meant as there were no answers around me.</p>

<p>I can testify that the Lord has been faithful to our souls. He brought us out of confusion and into a place of great blessing. We go to the Word and are fed by His Spirit. It is truly a very wealthy place. It has now been eight years that we have been fellowshipping with this family, and our faith and trust in God has grown. The Lord had prepared us in many ways to trust Him more with different areas of our lives before we had met this family. The Lord knows how to bring us out of darkness and into the light. Seek Him and He will make your path straight.</p>

<p>I am truly blessed that our children are being fed by the living waters of God&#8217;s Word. A foundation is being laid by the Holy Spirit to help them understand truth. They have experienced many trials wherein the Lord has seen fit to do His perfect work in them. The refiner&#8217;s fire is not pleasant at the time, but they can look back and thank the Lord that <span class="scripture">&#8220;no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psa+84%3All" title="Psa 84:ll"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psa 84:ll)</span></a></span> Before, we were deceived by the enemy of our souls into thinking that there is no true victory for God&#8217;s children&#8212;there was a continual blundering around with giving into temptation, repenting and then being forgiven again, to continue as before, falling and then rising again. It is with much thanksgiving that we see and understand the truth of the power of the resurrected Christ. <span class="scripture">&#8220;We being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+1%3A74-75" title="Luke 1:74-75"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 1:74-75)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have frllowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us [all mankind is in a condition where we need deliverance from sin, and if we are not able to acknowledge this we are unable to receive truth]. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+1%3A7-9" title="I&nbsp;John 1:7-9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 1:7-9)</span></a></span></p>

<p>We are now a peculiar people in the terms of this world. I expect we will become more peculiar as time goes on. We all have faults that are not acts of rebellion, but the habits that we cultivated when away from God in order to survive in this world (i.e., talking too much, needing to be in control, dominating others, too compromising, avoiding conflict, etc.). The Lord is continually working on us. If we let Him, He will refine us and make us into vessels that will honor Him. We are as children along the pathway of life. The Lord has laid a foundation and is continually preparing us for the next lesson in life. He will not expect us to take on more than he has prepared us to take on, and yet He expects us to grow and mature in our faith and trust in Him. Can we sing this song?</p>

<p class="verse">More like Christ, my heart is praying,<br />More like Christ from day to day.<br />All His graces rich displaying,<br />While I tread my pilgrim way.</p>

<p class="verse">More like Christ in deeds of kindness,<br />And in all the words I say,<br />Yearning for the souls in blindness,<br />Who are going far astray.</p>

<p class="verse">More like Christ in burden bearing,<br />Helping all the sad and weak;<br />Tears and sorrows gladly sharing,<br />Others&#8217; pleasure would I seek.</p>

<p class="verse">More like Christ in self-denial,<br />Seeking not a life of ease;<br />Patient in the depths of trial,<br />That my Savior I may please.</p>

<p class="verse refrain_line">Refrain:</p><p class="verse refrain">More like Christ, every day,<br />More like Christ, my heart doth say;<br />Yes, more like Christ,<br />More like Christ every day.<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/More_Like_Christ/index.html" title="More Like Christ">*</a></p>

<p>Are you like so many that are struggling within to obey and please God? You love Him, and yet there is often an unwillingness for self to let go as we often think we know what is right. You know you are saved, but you realize that the Lord has more for His children. Dear ones, there are two separate works of grace from God. The first is the work of salvation (justification), and the second the work of sanctification. A sanctified life is one where the Holy Spirit dwells within to take control. Both are received by faith. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the Lord.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+4%3A5" title="Psalm 4:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 4:5)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;For this is the will of God, even your sanctification.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Thessalonians+4%3A3" title="I&nbsp;Thessalonians 4:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Thessalonians 4:3)</span></a></span></p>

<p>So often I have seen that the great trials in my life have been due to misunderstanding in communicating with the ones I love. I am then challenged with feelings of being out of control. At these times, I am learning that my comfort can only come from the Lord, knowing that He knows all about it and has plans for good and not evil. We get stirred up when we perceive injustice, or troubles befall us because we have been misunderstood, and decisions are made unknowingly and consequences fall in line. There are many, many ways that the enemy of our souls tries to brew troubles&#8212;and so often it all comes at once. My feelings and emotions so often get me into these battles and I am just recently learning to run to the safety of the Lord. I have run to Him many times today as it is the time the Lord has so allowed many trials to come my way. The Lord still has much work to do in me, and I am sure it will be this way until He decides to take me home. I am looking forward to that glorious day.</p>

<p>As the years pass by I see more and more the frailty of man, no matter how earnest, and the mighty power of God no matter how big our problems may be.</p>

<p class="verse">I must tell Jesus all of my trials,<br />I cannot bear these burdens alone;<br />In my distress He kindly will help me,<br />He ever loves and cares for His own.</p>

<p class="verse">I must tell Jesus all of my troubles,<br />He is a kind compassionate Friend;<br />If I but ask Him He will deliver,<br />Make of my troubles quickly an end.</p>

<p class="verse">Tempted and tried I need a great Savior,<br />One who can help my burdens to bear;<br />I must tell Jesus, I must tell Jesus:<br />He all my cares and sorrows will share.<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/I_Must_Tell_Jesus/index.html" title="I Must Tell Jesus">*</a></p>

<p>As a child of God, we are called continually to die to self. Satan makes sure that we are tempted in all areas, and one area he tempts us in is for self to rise up and claim its own. Dying to our self has to occur in order for God to stay first in one&#8217;s life. Oh, this is not easy if our feelings are allowed to take precedence&#8212;we need to give our feelings over to the Lord and take hold of the promises of God, who knows best.</p>

<p>It is God&#8217;s plan for all His children to be united. He has saved us by His power to live a life above sin, and His saving power is the same today as it was at the time that Jesus was alive here on earth, ministering to the sick, emotionally-disturbed, and dying, sinsick souls. Let me close this thought with a quote from a true story, <a href="../../../texts/The_Man_of_His_Counsel/index.html" title="The Man of His Counsel">The Man of His Counsel</a>, (which I highly recommend to all who desire to obey God and live true to His Word):</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">&#8220;I did not join [the church], but God took me in as a member when He pardoned my sins. He then placed me in the body, which is His church, and I did not need to join anything to be a church member. I am one of the great family of God, and all other of His children are my brothers and sisters.&#8221;</p>

<div class="blurb"><p class="first">Bristol, England. February 8, 1842. Based on a true story.</p>
</div>


<hr class="minor" />
<div class="right"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_9/shilling_girls.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="314" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Eat every crumb of your bread, Sarah,&#8221; said Frances. &#8220;We won&#8217;t have any tomorrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Sarah asked, looking around at the long tables filled with orphans eating their lunch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard Mr. Muller talking to the other leaders here. He told them all to pray because there is only enough food for today; there&#8217;s none for tomorrow. And we are almost out of coal to keep us warm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely God will answer our prayers,&#8221; Sarah said, but felt a bit doubtful.</p>

<p>Frances shook her head. &#8220;Then where is the money we need?&#8221; she said scornfully. Sarah felt fear making a cold knot in her stomach. No food at all! Would all of the orphans go hungry?</p>

<p>After lunch, Sarah was sent to take a message over to the Infant Orphan House. She thought about Frances&#8217; words. Frances was twelve, older than eight-year-old Sarah, and she usually knew everything about what was going on. Would there be no food at all tomorrow? Would they have to beg people in the streets for their food, as many of them had done before coming to Mr. Muller&#8217;s orphan houses?</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_9/shilling_finding.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="222" /></div>
<p>As she shuffled along the roadside, Sarah&#8217;s eyes caught sight of something shiny. A shilling! Quickly, she picked it up and slipped it into her pocket. There was no way of finding out whose it was, so it was lawfully hers. Sarah did not have any other money, and she was glad to have found a shilling. She wouldn&#8217;t have to go hungry tomorrow! When she arrived back at the Girls&#8217; House, Sarah saw a lovely carriage out front. A lady was removing huge cakes from the back. She smiled at Sarah. &#8220;Here,&#8221; she said, handing one tray to Sarah, &#8220;will you carry this inside for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; Sarah replied. &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a little treat for all of you&#8212;plum cake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sarah beamed with delight. Plum cake! Surely there would be enough for one meal tomorrow.</p>

<p>That evening as the head matron led evening prayer time, Sarah fingered the shilling in her pocket. She wondered how much bread it could buy. Suddenly, her ears caught some of the matron&#8217;s words: &#8220;There are millions of boys and girls just like you in China who have never heard the gospel. We need to pray with all our hearts that missionaries will get the money they need to go to China and tell them about Jesus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sarah&#8217;s hand tightened around her little shilling. She had a sudden idea of what she could do with it, but she didn&#8217;t like the idea. &#8220;I need this shilling for when we have no more food!&#8221; she thought.</p>

<p>After prayers, all of the orphans went to get ready for bed. Sarah was the last one to start upstairs. She was standing on the bottom step, thinking hard about the heathen children in China, when a friendly voice startled her.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_9/shilling_muller.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="332" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Is something wrong, child?&#8221; It was Mr. Muller! Sarah felt a little bit afraid. He was an important man: the pastor of the church, and the head of all the orphan houses.</p>

<p>&#8220;No sir, I only was wondering&#8212;is it true that we&#8217;ve no more money to buy food or coal?&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is true.&#8221; He did not look even a tiny bit worried.</p>

<p>&#8220;What will happen to us?&#8221; Sarah asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;God will provide for us. Remember, the Bible tells us that God who feeds the birds of the air, and clothes the lilies of the field will also take care of us, <span class="scripture">&#8216;for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+6%3A32" title="Matthew 6:32"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 6:32)</span></a></span> We are told to seek His kingdom, and to not worry about tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&#8230;&#8203;will He really&#8230;&#8203;do it?&#8221; she stammered.</p>

<p>Mr. Muller smiled. &#8220;He has to! He cannot break His Word! And not once during the seven years of these orphan houses has anyone ever gone hungry!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sarah was quiet. &#8220;Thank you, Mr. Muller,&#8221; she said at last. &#8220;Would you send this to help the children in China hear about Jesus?&#8221; She handed him her shilling. He took it and nodded solemnly. &#8220;That I will do.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a light heart, Sarah ran up to bed. That night she could hardly sleep from excitement. She could not wait to see how God would answer their prayers and bring them food tomorrow. The next morning she sang as she dressed. Frances looked at her puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you so happy about?&#8221; she asked sourly.</p>

<p>&#8220;God is going to give us our food today,&#8221; Sarah replied cheerfully.</p>

<p>Frances shook her head. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to have anything but a slice of plum cake all day,&#8221; she growled.</p>

<p>Just as Sarah was coming downstairs for morning prayers, the doorbell rang. She watched as the matron opened it. A man stood on the threshold with his hat in his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said, shifting back and forth nervously. &#8220;I&#8212;this may be a bit strange, but I was on my way to work this morning when I began to think about the orphans, and I thought that the Lord wanted me to give some money for them. I didn&#8217;t mean to come till this evening, but I felt I ought to come now. Here&#8217;s three sovereigns; hope you can use them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sarah was so excited she didn&#8217;t even hear what the matron answered. Three whole sovereigns! Enough for bread and milk all day! She ran back upstairs to tell Frances. When she heard the news, her mouth dropped open in astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it,&#8221; Frances said.</p>

<p>&#8220;See for yourself, then, when there&#8217;s plenty to eat!&#8221; Sarah replied. She wondered why she had ever doubted that God would meet their needs. She hadn&#8217;t needed her shilling after all&#8212;but she hoped God would use it to answer someone else&#8217;s prayers!</p>
