<h1>This Thing Is from Me</h1>

<p>&#8220;Life&#8217;s disappointments are veiled love&#8217;s appointments.&#8221; &#8212;C. A. Fox</p>

<p>My child, I have a message for you today, let Me whisper it in your ear, that it may gild with glory the storm clouds that may arise and smooth the rough places upon which you may have to tread.</p>

<p>It is short&#8212;only five words, but let them sink into your inmost soul. Use them as a pillow on which to rest your weary head: &#8220;This Thing Is From Me.&#8221; Have you ever thought that all that concerns you, concerns Me, too? <span class="scripture">&#8220;For he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Zechariah+2%3A8" title="Zechariah 2:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Zechariah 2:8)</span></a></span></p>

<p>You are very precious in My sight. Therefore it is My special delight to educate you.</p>

<p>I would have you to learn when the temptations assail you and the <span class="scripture">&#8220;enemy [comes] in like a flood,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+59%3A19" title="Isaiah 59:19"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 59:19)</span></a></span> that this thing is from Me, that your weakness needs My might and your safety lies in letting Me fight for you.</p>

<p>Are you in difficult circumstances, surrounded by people who do not understand you, who never consult your taste, who put you in the background? This thing is from Me. I am the God of circumstances. You didn&#8217;t come to this place by accident. It is the very place God meant for you. Have you not asked to be more humble? See, then, I have placed you in the very school where this lesson is taught; your companions are only working out My will.</p>

<p>Are you in financial difficulties? Is it hard to make both ends meet? This thing is from Me, for I am your provider, and I would have you draw from and depend on Me. My supplies are limitless (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+4%3A19">Philippians 4:19</a>) I would have you prove My promises. Let it not be said of you, <span class="scripture">&#8220;In this thing ye did not believe the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> your God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+1%3A32" title="Deuteronomy 1:32"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Deuteronomy 1:32)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Are you passing through a night of sorrow? This thing is from Me. I am <span class="scripture">&#8220;a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+53%3A3" title="Isaiah 53:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 53:3)</span></a></span> I have let earthly comforts fail you, that by turning to Me you may obtain everlasting consolation.</p>

<p>Has some friend disappointed you&#8212;one to whom you opened your heart? This thing is from Me. I have allowed this disappointment to come that you may learn that,</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;The best friend to have is Jesus,<br />He will hear you when you call,<br />He will keep you lest you fall;<br />The best friend to have is Jesus.&#8221;</p>

<p>I want to be your confidant. Has someone repeated things about you that are untrue? Leave them to Me, and draw closer to Me, your shelter, out of reach of the <span class="scripture">&#8220;strife of tongues,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+31%3A20" title="Psalm 31:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 31:20)</span></a></span> for, <span class="scripture">&#8220;I will bringforth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgement as the noonday.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+37%3A6" title="Psalm 37:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 37:6)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Have your plans been all upset? Are you bowed down and weary? This thing is from Me. You made your plans, then came asking Me to bless them, but I would have you let Me plan for you, and then I take the responsibility, for <span class="scripture">&#8220;this thing is too heavy for thee, thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Exodus+18%3A18" title="Exodus 18:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Exodus 18:18)</span></a></span> You are only an instrument, not an agent.</p>

<p>Have you longed to do some great work for Me, and instead been laid aside on a bed of pain and weakness? This thing is from Me. I want to teach you some of My deepest lessons. &#8220;They also serve who only stand and wait.&#8221; Some of My greatest workers are those shut out from active service, that they may learn to wield the weapon of prayer.</p>

<p>Are you suddenly called to occupy a difficult and responsible position? Launch out on Me. I am trusting you with the &#8220;possession of difficulties,&#8221; and for this <span class="scripture">&#8220;&#8220;the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+15%3A10" title="Deuteronomy 15:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Deuteronomy 15:10)</span></a></span></p>

<p>This day I place in your hands the pot of holy oil. Make use of it freely, My child. Let every circumstance, as it arises, every word, as it pains you, every interruption that would make you impatient, every revelation of your own weakness, be anointed with it. This sting will go as you learn to see Me in all things.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;The thing He sends is always good,<br />So let&#8217;s receive it as we should;<br />Let&#8217;s never murmur nor complain,<br />But gladly suffer for His name.</p>
