<h1>Symbolic Instruments</h1>

<p>Let us notice more Scriptural teachings on the subject. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+5%3A8" title="Revelation 5:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 5:8)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;And I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+14%3A2" title="Revelation 14:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 14:2)</span></a></span> As we consider this scene, let us understand that it was before the throne in heaven. The book of Revelation is a book of symbols. Literal things are used as symbols of spiritual things. If we are to literalize this scene, we should have to literalize the golden vials and odors as well as the harps, and this would be very unwise. There would have to be goldsmiths to make the harps and vials, and fields in which to grow spices to make the odors. (The Scripture plainly states what the odors are.) In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+19%3A11">Revelation 19:11</a> Jesus is pictured riding on a white horse, and in different parts of Revelation we read of monstrous beasts and creatures. We know they are symbols, but if you literalize the harp, then you would need to get a white horse and bring him into your worship.</p>

<p>Since the odors are <span class="scripture">&#8220;prayers of the saints&#8221;</span> (redeemed people), then the vial would symbolize the vessel which contains the odors. Perfect harmony existed between the redeemed souls, God, and the angels. This is symbolized by harps. When a child of God tunes his heart to the great heart and will of God, that is harping on his harp. Nothing is more music to the ear of God than a group of spiritual saints with their hearts and souls in perfect tune with the Word and Spirit of God. How necessary it is to keep our heart (harp) in perfect tune with the great heart of God. There must not be any discord, for it is easily detected, even as a discord on a literal instrument when one string is out of tune, it will spoil the music. Let us be sure our heart is in tune with God at all times. This is the secret of holy living. Praise God forever!</p>

<p>Let us consider another text: <span class="scripture">&#8220;And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her. The L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there. Selah. As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all my springs are in thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+87%3A5-7" title="Psalm 87:5-7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 87:5-7)</span></a></span> Some who fail to rightly divide this, hold to it for their musical instruments in worship. The text is talking of Zion, the church. The church of God, Zion, and the kingdom of God all have the same meaning (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A22-23">Hebrews 12:22-23</a>). Paul says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+3%3A14-15" title="Ephesians 3:14-15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 3:14-15)</span></a></span> Zion consists of all the redeemed of all ages. Part of Zion departed from this earth under the Abrahamic covenant, part under the Mosaic dispensation, and part under this grace dispensation. Zion includes all the redeemed living at present and those who have passed on; so the players on instruments would include David and all the law worshipers, and singers would mean the grace or spiritual worshipers. Is this not plain? Paul said part of the church was in heaven and part of it in earth. When we die, we do not die out of the church. We stay in the church, but just move upstairs with other redeemed ones and our dear Redeemer. This is sound doctrine, according to God&#8217;s Word.</p>
