<h1>The Question</h1>

<p>Can we worship God with musical instruments in the New Testament church?</p>

<p>This is a vital question of the day in which we live. So many people are in error on this subject that I feel especially burdened of the Lord to write on it. I used to think it didn&#8217;t make much difference whether we did or did not have musical instruments in the church, but the Lord has showed me some vital truths on the subject in His Word.</p>

<p>The Lord has always required His people to do all things according to His Word, as He told Moses to <span class="scripture">&#8220;make all things according to the pattern&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+8%3A5" title="Hebrews 8:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 8:5)</span></a></span> which He showed him on the mount; and Jesus said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+6%3A46" title="Luke 6:46"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 6:46)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Before we discuss this subject, we must say, as Jesus told Nicodemus, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+3%3A3" title="John 3:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 3:3)</span></a></span> Dear reader, it is needful for you to have been born of the Spirit of God, for this writing is about spiritual things that are in the kingdom of God, so one must be in the spiritual kingdom to see spiritual things. The natural man cannot discern the things of the Spirit, for they are foolishness to him. This subject of music in the church is surely a spiritual subject. Now, dear reader, get your Bible out before you read any farther, as this question can only be answered by the Word of God. I am going to deal wholly with God&#8217;s Word.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Musical_Instruments_and_Worship/What_is_Worship/index.html">What is Worship?</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>What is Worship?</h1>

<p>Back under the Law they used all kinds of instruments of music in the worship of God, as we can find in many psalms, especially <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+149">Psalm 150</a>. To this we agree. But David also killed his enemies with the sword, and he did many other things which God&#8217;s people cannot do today. David could not be born of the Spirit of God and have his heart clean and in harmony with God. He had to worship Him in a literal way and show his love all on the outside.</p>

<p>But now let us go to my text. Jesus said to the woman by the well, <span class="scripture">&#8220;But the hour cometh and now is when the <b>true worshipers</b> shall worship the Father in <b>spirit</b> and in <b>truth</b>: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in Spirit and in truth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+4%3A23-24" title="John 4:23-24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 4:23-24)</span></a></span> This text means much to the born-again, Spirit-filled soul who is open for the truth. First, let us notice that some must be worshiping God in error, or Jesus would not have mentioned and put emphasis on the true worshipers. We must not overlook this. Read <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+15%3A7-9">Matthew 15:7-9</a>. <span class="scripture">&#8220;<b>But in vain do they worship me.</b>&#8221;</span> According to this Scripture, it is possible to worship God in vain, or wrong, or of no profit. Paul said of certain people, <span class="scripture">&#8220;For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+17%3A23" title="Acts 17:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 17:23)</span></a></span> Many today are ignorantly worshiping God, but Jesus, in our text, is speaking to the true worshipers. Worship means to reverence and adore and highly honor God. Jesus said the true worshipers must worship in Spirit and truth. Truth means according to His Word. Jesus said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Thy Word is truth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+17%3A17" title="John 17:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 17:17)</span></a></span> Paul said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Let God be true, but every man a liar.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+3%3A4" title="Romans 3:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 3:4)</span></a></span> Worship in this dispensation means spiritual worship, which consists of praying and singing in the Spirit, which is indeed the greatest privilege granted to people of any and all ages; for until Christ came, no people could worship God in Spirit, as the Spirit of God did not dwell in man. Man did not have a clean heart, and God could not put his Spirit into an unclean heart. God had to dwell in the tabernacle which Moses built, and the people had to worship him with their hands and feet, and with animals and all kinds of temporal worship. This is why David worshiped Him with the timbrel and the dance. He could not worship God in Spirit.</p>

<p>But God promised His people all down through the ages that He was going to make a new covenant. Read <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+18%3A15">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>; <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+7%3A37">Acts 7:37</a>; <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+31%3A31">Jeremiah 31:31</a>. Now let us go to <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+36">Ezekiel 36</a>. Here the Lord spoke through His prophet: <span class="scripture">&#8220;Then [meaning some future date, or when Christ comes] will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness [sin] and from all your idols will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you and a new Spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony [hard] heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh [soft]. And I will put my Spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+36%3A25-27" title="Ezekiel 36:25-27"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ezekiel 36:25-27)</span></a></span> Praise God! Now read <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+14%3A23">John 14:23</a>; <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+3%3A16-17">I&nbsp;Corinthians 3:16-17</a>; <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+6%3A19-20">I&nbsp;Corinthians 6:19-20</a>; and <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+6%3A16">II&nbsp;Corinthians 6:16</a>. Please read all of these texts with me as we go along.</p>

<p>After you have read these texts you will see that the prophecy of <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ezekiel+36%3A25">Ezekiel 36:25</a> and <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Jeremiah+31%3A31">Jeremiah 31:31</a> has been fulfilled, and you and I today come under it through Christ, the Mediator of the new covenant. We must realize this fully in order to understand what Jesus told the woman at the well. The true worshipers must worship God in Spirit. If people have not been regenerated and possess this new heart of which Ezekiel spoke, and God&#8217;s Spirit within them, they cannot worship God in Spirit. Therefore they use their musical instruments as David of old; but God does not accept this kind of worship now. When Solomon built the temple, he used musical instruments to dedicate it to God (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Chronicles+5%3A13-14">II&nbsp;Chronicles 5:13-14</a>). When the one hundred twenty trumpeters and singers were in harmony, as one, the glory of God filled the temple, or building. This temple was, as all the law and ordinances, a type and shadow of things to come (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+8%3A5">Hebrews 8:5</a>). Read <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+8-10%3A1">Hebrews 8-9 and 10:1</a>. When Solomon dedicated the temple he had one hundred and twenty trumpeters. They all played as one man and the glory filled the house. This was a direct shadow or type of the day of Pentecost as recorded in Acts second chapter. One hundred and twenty people were in one accord as one man and God sent the glory, or his Holy Spirit, and this time it filled their hearts, which is now God&#8217;s temple. The hearts of men and women took the place of the literal temple building made of earthly material, and God moved out of the literal building made of earthly material, and moved into His people&#8217;s hearts, cleansing them and keeping them clean for the abode of His Spirit. Praise His name forever.</p>

<p>This is verified in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+7%3A47-51">Acts 7:47-51</a>. Brother Stephen was preaching this very subject when he was stoned to death. In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+17%3A22-30">Acts 17:22-30</a>, Paul was preaching on this same subject. <span class="scripture">&#8220;God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; neither is worshipped with men&#8217;s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+17%3A24" title="Acts 17:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 17:24)</span></a></span> This is enough to convince any honest-hearted person that God is not worshiped with musical instruments and men&#8217;s hands or feet or any part of our temporal bodies. In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+4%3A8">I&nbsp;Timothy 4:8</a>, Paul said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;For bodily exercise profiteth little.&#8221;</span> This should be enough, but let us consider a few more thoughts. A certain minister, who was pleading for his congregation to buy a pipe organ, said that many souls were won to the Lord by the instrument. This cannot be possible. Jesus said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+6%3A44" title="John 6:44"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 6:44)</span></a></span> God draws through the Holy Spirit. We have proved that God does not dwell in temples made with hands (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+7%3A48%3B+17%3A24">Acts 7:48; 17:24</a>). Then it would be impossible for anyone to be drawn to God through a musical instrument of any kind, because they are made with hands. We agree that a spirit accompanies instrumental music, but we must not mistake it for God&#8217;s Spirit. I have known people to work hard all day and be very tired, then go to a dance, and something about the music there would cause them to revive until they could dance almost all night. Some tunes, when played on instruments, will cause people to weep; but this is not God&#8217;s Spirit. The Bible says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Godly sorrow worketh repentance.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+7%3A10" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 7:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 7:10)</span></a></span> Just because a person hears some sad tune or one that brings old memories to his mind, does not mean he has godly sorrow.</p>

<p>Let us reason together a little. Jesus said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;That which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+16%3A15" title="Luke 16:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 16:15)</span></a></span> What can you think of today that is more highly esteemed among men than musical instruments? They are used to draw people into the honky tonks; when a circus comes to town, they parade down the streets with all kinds of music; and at dances and worldly receptions, no matter how ungodly they are, musical instruments are the main draw. Since the devil esteems instrumental music so highly to draw for him, do you think the Lord wants His people to use the same thing to draw people to Him? No, dear one, the Lord has His Spirit to draw people&#8212;a meek and a quiet Spirit&#8212;and He does not work through any kind of man-made instrument or any confusion of noises. Read <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Kings+19%3A11-13">I&nbsp;Kings 19:11-13</a>, and you will find an example that is still good today. Dear soul, this is truth according to God&#8217;s Word.</p>

<p>Now let us read carefully <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A6-20">Ephesians 5:6-20</a>. The 18th and 19th verses say: <span class="scripture">&#8220;And be not drunk with wine wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.&#8221;</span> The word <i>melody</i> means music. Is not this plain, where we are to make music or melody? God&#8217;s Spirit dwells in our hearts; and when we sing or pray out of a Spirit-filled heart, it makes melody or music in the ears of God. His Spirit bears witness with our spirit that we are the sons of God (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A16">Romans 8:16</a>). This is what makes the music. Music means harmony. When God&#8217;s Spirit dwelling in our hearts, witnesses with God&#8217;s Spirit which is in heaven, that makes a tune which brings a sweet harmony or melody in our hearts to God, as in the text. David made melody on his harp and God accepted it then, but his harp was a type of our hearts. David played tunes to God, but our hearts are to play tunes to Him now. The musical instrument was strictly a law ordinance, and was nailed to the cross as a form of worship.</p>

<p>Again Paul exhorted, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+3%3A16" title="Colossians 3:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 3:16)</span></a></span> Here we find again <span class="scripture">&#8220;spiritual songs.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>In connection with Jesus&#8217; ministry, we do not find one word concerning musical instruments except in one place where he put the minstrels out of the room before he raised the dead girl. Paul, in his writing to the churches, commended them for their much love and faith and for giving and being faithful, and many other things; but nowhere did he mention about anyone playing well on an instrument, neither did any of the other apostles or any of the other writers; and, according to my understanding, history does not record an instance of the use of a musical instrument in the early church. Most of the reformers of later years and movements, such as Wesley, Campbell, and Luther, did not use musical instruments in their worship. God was with them in Spirit at first, but as the reformation grew and people received more light and failed to walk in it, then God&#8217;s Spirit moved out of their assembly and they found their meetings void of the Spirit. Then they brought in musical instruments to entertain and fill the vacant place. Any honest soul knows this is truth.</p>

<h1>Symbolic Instruments</h1>

<p>Let us notice more Scriptural teachings on the subject. <span class="scripture">&#8220;And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+5%3A8" title="Revelation 5:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 5:8)</span></a></span> <span class="scripture">&#8220;And I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+14%3A2" title="Revelation 14:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelation 14:2)</span></a></span> As we consider this scene, let us understand that it was before the throne in heaven. The book of Revelation is a book of symbols. Literal things are used as symbols of spiritual things. If we are to literalize this scene, we should have to literalize the golden vials and odors as well as the harps, and this would be very unwise. There would have to be goldsmiths to make the harps and vials, and fields in which to grow spices to make the odors. (The Scripture plainly states what the odors are.) In <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelation+19%3A11">Revelation 19:11</a> Jesus is pictured riding on a white horse, and in different parts of Revelation we read of monstrous beasts and creatures. We know they are symbols, but if you literalize the harp, then you would need to get a white horse and bring him into your worship.</p>

<p>Since the odors are <span class="scripture">&#8220;prayers of the saints&#8221;</span> (redeemed people), then the vial would symbolize the vessel which contains the odors. Perfect harmony existed between the redeemed souls, God, and the angels. This is symbolized by harps. When a child of God tunes his heart to the great heart and will of God, that is harping on his harp. Nothing is more music to the ear of God than a group of spiritual saints with their hearts and souls in perfect tune with the Word and Spirit of God. How necessary it is to keep our heart (harp) in perfect tune with the great heart of God. There must not be any discord, for it is easily detected, even as a discord on a literal instrument when one string is out of tune, it will spoil the music. Let us be sure our heart is in tune with God at all times. This is the secret of holy living. Praise God forever!</p>

<p>Let us consider another text: <span class="scripture">&#8220;And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her. The L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there. Selah. As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all my springs are in thee.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+87%3A5-7" title="Psalm 87:5-7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 87:5-7)</span></a></span> Some who fail to rightly divide this, hold to it for their musical instruments in worship. The text is talking of Zion, the church. The church of God, Zion, and the kingdom of God all have the same meaning (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A22-23">Hebrews 12:22-23</a>). Paul says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+3%3A14-15" title="Ephesians 3:14-15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 3:14-15)</span></a></span> Zion consists of all the redeemed of all ages. Part of Zion departed from this earth under the Abrahamic covenant, part under the Mosaic dispensation, and part under this grace dispensation. Zion includes all the redeemed living at present and those who have passed on; so the players on instruments would include David and all the law worshipers, and singers would mean the grace or spiritual worshipers. Is this not plain? Paul said part of the church was in heaven and part of it in earth. When we die, we do not die out of the church. We stay in the church, but just move upstairs with other redeemed ones and our dear Redeemer. This is sound doctrine, according to God&#8217;s Word.</p>

<h1>The Principle</h1>

<p>Someone may say, &#8220;I still don&#8217;t find where the Word says not to have musical instruments in worship.&#8221; This is true. There are many things that God did not mention by name, but He did leave us a principle to go by and He deals with the positive side of everything. It would take most of the world to hold the books He had to tell us the negative side of everything. He tells us what to do and leaves us a principle to go by and expects us to measure to it.</p>

<p>Let us notice a few texts on this line. <span class="scripture">&#8220;Ye shall not do after all things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+12%3A8" title="Deuteronomy 12:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Deuteronomy 12:8)</span></a></span> God does not want people to draw their own pattern to follow Him (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Leviticus+10%3A1%3B+Proverbs+14%3A12">Leviticus 10:1; Proverbs 14:12</a>). Notice what happened to Aaron&#8217;s sons for offering strange fire before God. He slew both of them before the altar. It is dangerous to trifle with God. David decided to bring back the ark which had been stolen and it pleased all the people and God (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Chronicles+13%3A1-14%3B+15%3A2%2C13">I&nbsp;Chronicles 13:1-14; 15:2,13</a>). But David failed to get the book of the Law and see how God had planned for it to be moved. He got some helpers and made a cart, etc.; but God was displeased and slew a man, and David was troubled. He learned that God had a plan for the Levites to carry it on their shoulders. After he learned how God wanted it moved, he moved it and God blessed him. Israel had been keeping the feast of Tabernacles for a number of years, but not according to the Law (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Nehemiah+8%3A13-17">Nehemiah 8:13-17</a>), and when they found in the book of the Law that the people should dwell in booths of palm branches, etc., they did this just like God said, and God blessed them greatly.</p>

<p>This is a principle that we can follow all the way through the Bible. God did not say not to use musical instruments in worship, and He did not say not to watch television, and He did not tell us not to smoke tobacco. But He did tell us what to do, how to do it, and expects us to do it His way, not ours. It is a dangerous thing to trifle with God and His word.</p>
