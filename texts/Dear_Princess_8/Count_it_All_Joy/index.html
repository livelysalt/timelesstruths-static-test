<h1>Count it All Joy</h1>

<p class="author">Skye Erickson</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;My [sisters] count it <i>all</i> joy, when you fall into divers temptations; Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+1%3A2-3" title="James 1:2-3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 1:2-3)</span></a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>Do you ever find it hard to count it <i>all</i> joy? When in the midst of flurry, your little sibling is clinging to your leg while you&#8217;re rushing to save the toast from burning&#8230;&#8203;only to miss it by a few seconds? Or maybe your mother is sick and you have the house to keep up; baby&#8217;s got a wet diaper, the phone is ringing, and your mother is waiting for her soup. Or perhaps you mentioned something to the family&#8212;something you didn&#8217;t want shared with others outside the family circle just yet&#8230;&#8203;but, oops, someone leaked it out.</p>

<p>I am sure we have all been in similar situations and/or under trying circumstances. And I am sure we have all, one time or another, felt discouraged or overwhelmed or frustrated, or maybe all three. During crazy times like that (and they happen just about weekly!) it is sometimes hard to remember to count it all joy; I often feel like running to a quiet place and crying out my frustration. It is certainly easier to be joyful and content in the Lord when life is going easily, but what about during the harder times? James, by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, told us to count it all&#8212;especially the trying times&#8212;joy.</p>

<p>One day, just recently, my heart grew sore with temptation and I was frustrated and hurt by another&#8217;s action. The devil was strongly tempting me to hold a grudge; the Lord on the other hand, was urging me to remember His Word and count it all joy. After praying for some time to take away any bad feelings I might&#8217;ve had, He gave me a song and inspired my heart. May I share it with you?</p>

<p><a href="../../../music/Cast_Thy_Cares_Upon_the_Savior/index.html" title="Cast Thy Cares Upon the Savior">Cast Thy Cares Upon the Savior</a></p>

<p class="verse">Edwin Whitmore</p>

<p class="verse">Cast thy cares upon the Savior,<br />He will bear them all for thee;<br />And thy soul which now is burdened,<br />Shall be kept forever free.</p>

<p class="verse">Put your trust alone in Jesus,<br />Trusting not in human arm;<br />And if cast within the furnace,<br />He will keep thee from all harm.</p>

<p class="verse">Live the life the word demands you,<br />Then the foe you need not fear;<br />For while standing on the promise,<br />Jesus Christ is always near.</p>

<p class="verse refrain_line">Refrain:</p><p class="verse refrain">Cast thy cares upon the Savior,<br />He will gladly bear them all;<br />Even though they seem like mountains,<br />Even though they may be small.</p>

<p>I am certainly a novice when it comes to rejoicing in the midst of trials, but by God&#8217;s help and leading, I&#8217;d like to share with you some insights that helped me to count it all joy.</p>

<h2>Quiet Your Heart</h2>
<p class="verse">Cast thy cares upon the Savior,<br />He will bear them all for thee;<br />And thy soul which now is burdened,<br />Shall be kept forever free.</p>

<p>Probably the greatest action we could make when we&#8217;re frustrated and weary, is to cast our cares upon the gentle breast of our Heavenly Father, <span class="scripture">&#8220;for he careth for you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+5%3A7" title="I&nbsp;Peter 5:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 5:7)</span></a></span> When you are sorely tried and in need of grace, take a little time apart to quiet your heart before the Lord and tune into His Heavenly grace and peace. By doing so, we can give to Him all the things that disturb us, frustrate us, make us sad&#8212;in turn, receive peace and strength to press on.</p>

<h2>As Hollow Channels</h2>
<p class="verse">Put your trust alone in Jesus,<br />Trusting not in human arm;<br />And if cast within the furnace,<br />He will keep thee from all harm.</p>

<p>Put your trust <i>alone</i> in Jesus. When we trust in ourselves, in our strength, we will fail in counting it all joy. Why? We are nothing, and our strength is weak; we have little means of getting on by ourselves. We were created to be dependent on the Lord and He is One we can lean on&#8212;who has great storehouses of grace and strength. If we open ourselves to Him, make ourselves as hollow channels for Him to fill and work through, He will try us in the fire till we come forth, like Job, as gold.</p>

<h2>Standing on His Promises</h2>
<p class="verse">Live the life the word demands you,<br />Then the foe you need not fear;<br />For while standing on the promise,<br />Jesus Christ is always near.</p>

<p>What are some of His promises to us?</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+1%3A12" title="James 1:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 1:12)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;But they that wait upon the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+40%3A31" title="Isaiah 40:31"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 40:31)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelations+2%3A26" title="Revelations 2:26"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelations 2:26)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelations+21%3A7" title="Revelations 21:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelations 21:7)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+1%3A7" title="I&nbsp;Peter 1:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 1:7)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+10%3A13" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 10:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 10:13)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+12%3A9" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 12:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 12:9)</span></a></span></p>

<h2>The Great Cloud of Witnesses</h2>
<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses&#8230;.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A1" title="Hebrews 12:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 12:1)</span></a></span></p>

<p>A dear friend of mine once mentioned to me that she sometimes felt like she was the only one out there struggling. Sound familiar? I, too, must admit that I have struggled with the same feeling. It is natural because we&#8217;re not all together and we can&#8217;t see each other struggling with the very same things. But I am greatly encouraged when I read about our &#8220;great cloud of witnesses.&#8221; There are countless others who have gone on before us, bearing their crosses and rejoicing in the Lord. As I already quoted, He will not give us more than we can bear and <span class="scripture">&#8220;we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A15" title="Hebrews 4:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 4:15)</span></a></span></p>

<p>It is a wonderful comfort to know that Jesus feels and has experienced the same burdens and cares and trials and weariness. He also knows our weak areas and ways that we re drawn to. Knowing this, counting our trials all joy will become easier and easier as our trust ascends unto higher places and our confidence grows deeper in Him.</p>

<h2>Sing a Song</h2>
<p>Have you ever tried singing a song when you&#8217;re tired and frustrated? What was the result? Many a time, when my heart was upset and not at peace, the Lord would bring a song to my heart and it would &#8220;calm the waves.&#8221;</p>

<p>When you feel yourself becoming frustrated or growing annoyed, start singing a song, <b>even if you don&#8217;t feel like it</b>! I can testify from experience that the joy and love that are entwined in the song will pop out at you and the Lord will invariably use it to nourish you and give you the little extra push to keep climbing upward.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+119%3A73" title="Psalm 119:73"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 119:73)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Oh, Lord, give us understanding and grace that we may learn to trust You through our trials that You see fit to send our way&#8212;that we may learn to count them all joy and glorify You through them.</p>
