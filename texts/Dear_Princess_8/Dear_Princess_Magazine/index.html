<h1><i>Dear Princess Magazine</i></h1>

<p><i>Dear Princess</i> is a quarterly publication for girls of all ages, who are striving to live holy lives and please their Heavenly Father in all areas of their lives.</p>

<p>Abigail Spinks, in the fall of 1996, started <i>Dear Princess</i> with a vision to hold up a higher standard and to encourage girls in pursuing righteousness, growing in grace, and becoming godly young women.</p>

<p>In January 1998, Abigail asked Skye Erickson to join her in the work as co-editor. And now, together, we are striving to glorify God through this ministry that He has placed in our hands.</p>

<p>Through <i>Dear Princess</i>, we wish to have a Bible-based publication, in which we not only want to share about homemaking skills, but what will encourage girls in becoming <i>spiritually prepared</i> for their future homes.</p>

<p>These are the precious days God has given us to learn and prepare for the next stage in life.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_8/magazine_children.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="257" /></div>
<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
<p>Abigail: My family consists of my parents, Mark and Elois, Coquetta Sue (18), and myself, Abigail (14). Daddy and Mama have homeschooled Coquetta and I all our lives, and we are thankful for the Lord giving us godly parents who want to serve the Lord with all their hearts. We live on a small acreage three miles out of the little town of Jefferson. We are grateful for the Lord giving us this place!</p>

<p>Skye: A little over three years ago I (now 17) came to live with Uncle Rick, Aunt Krista, and my four cousins: Laura (18), Joel (16), Kara (14), and Amanda (5). We live here in the beautiful Willamette Valley, on four acres of land.</p>

<p>Both families are heavily involved in <i>Dear Princess</i>, and we appreciate their wisdom and help very much!</p>

<h2>When You Write</h2>
<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+27%3A17" title="Proverbs 27:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 27:17)</span></a></span></p>

<p><i>Dear Princess</i> is written mainly by its readers, and we need your help to encourage others. As readers, you have the opportunity to encourage, challenge, and strengthen your other sisters in becoming more like Christ. Is there a lesson God has been teaching you lately, that you think others would benefit from? Is there a homemaking skill that has been hard for you in the past, but that you&#8217;ve found shortcuts to make the process easier? Has the Lord answered your prayers by helping you to be more patient with your siblings? Please share, and by so doing,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;let us consider one another to provoke [stir up, spur] unto love and to good works.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A24" title="Hebrews 10:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 10:24)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>In future issues, we would like to see more writings from <b>mothers, grandmothers, and older sisters.</b> Please feel free to share with us&#8212;you are very welcome to write in to encourage and teach us younger women.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness&#8230;&#8203;That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+2%3A3-5" title="Titus 2:3-5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Titus 2:3-5)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Again, we can&#8217;t tell you how much each of your letters mean to us&#8212;thank you and please keep writing; they are a great source of encouragement to us. Keep in mind that we consider your letters for print, so please state in your letter if you wish for it not to be printed.</p>

<p>We welcome any comments or suggestions about <i>Dear Princess</i>, so please write if you have any!</p>

<h2>Please Pray</h2>
<p><i>Big</i> is the task of putting out a magazine, even as small a one as this! We&#8217;d appreciate it, as we put this out, that you&#8217;d keep us in your prayers that we will print what is pleasing to the Lord and continue to glorify Him in all we do.</p>

<h2>How to Receive <i>Dear Princess</i></h2>
<p><i>Dear Princess</i> is supported by free-will offerings. We regard this magazine as not our own, but God&#8217;s and He has made it clear to us that He will supply all our needs.</p>

<p>By saying <i>Dear Princess</i> is supported by &#8220;free-will offerings,&#8221; we do not mean a sort of &#8220;pay as you can&#8221; subscription. If the Lord leads you to send in some money to help out with costs, we&#8217;ll gladly accept it. However, you do not need to send in money to receive <i>Dear Princess</i>; if you&#8217;d like to receive <i>Dear Princess</i>, simply write or call and we&#8217;ll put you on the mailing list.</p>
