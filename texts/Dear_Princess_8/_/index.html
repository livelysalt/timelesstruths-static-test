<h1><i>Dear Princess Magazine</i></h1>

<p><i>Dear Princess</i> is a quarterly publication for girls of all ages, who are striving to live holy lives and please their Heavenly Father in all areas of their lives.</p>

<p>Abigail Spinks, in the fall of 1996, started <i>Dear Princess</i> with a vision to hold up a higher standard and to encourage girls in pursuing righteousness, growing in grace, and becoming godly young women.</p>

<p>In January 1998, Abigail asked Skye Erickson to join her in the work as co-editor. And now, together, we are striving to glorify God through this ministry that He has placed in our hands.</p>

<p>Through <i>Dear Princess</i>, we wish to have a Bible-based publication, in which we not only want to share about homemaking skills, but what will encourage girls in becoming <i>spiritually prepared</i> for their future homes.</p>

<p>These are the precious days God has given us to learn and prepare for the next stage in life.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_8/magazine_children.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="257" /></div>
<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
<p>Abigail: My family consists of my parents, Mark and Elois, Coquetta Sue (18), and myself, Abigail (14). Daddy and Mama have homeschooled Coquetta and I all our lives, and we are thankful for the Lord giving us godly parents who want to serve the Lord with all their hearts. We live on a small acreage three miles out of the little town of Jefferson. We are grateful for the Lord giving us this place!</p>

<p>Skye: A little over three years ago I (now 17) came to live with Uncle Rick, Aunt Krista, and my four cousins: Laura (18), Joel (16), Kara (14), and Amanda (5). We live here in the beautiful Willamette Valley, on four acres of land.</p>

<p>Both families are heavily involved in <i>Dear Princess</i>, and we appreciate their wisdom and help very much!</p>

<h2>When You Write</h2>
<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+27%3A17" title="Proverbs 27:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 27:17)</span></a></span></p>

<p><i>Dear Princess</i> is written mainly by its readers, and we need your help to encourage others. As readers, you have the opportunity to encourage, challenge, and strengthen your other sisters in becoming more like Christ. Is there a lesson God has been teaching you lately, that you think others would benefit from? Is there a homemaking skill that has been hard for you in the past, but that you&#8217;ve found shortcuts to make the process easier? Has the Lord answered your prayers by helping you to be more patient with your siblings? Please share, and by so doing,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;let us consider one another to provoke [stir up, spur] unto love and to good works.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+10%3A24" title="Hebrews 10:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 10:24)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>In future issues, we would like to see more writings from <b>mothers, grandmothers, and older sisters.</b> Please feel free to share with us&#8212;you are very welcome to write in to encourage and teach us younger women.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness&#8230;&#8203;That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+2%3A3-5" title="Titus 2:3-5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Titus 2:3-5)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Again, we can&#8217;t tell you how much each of your letters mean to us&#8212;thank you and please keep writing; they are a great source of encouragement to us. Keep in mind that we consider your letters for print, so please state in your letter if you wish for it not to be printed.</p>

<p>We welcome any comments or suggestions about <i>Dear Princess</i>, so please write if you have any!</p>

<h2>Please Pray</h2>
<p><i>Big</i> is the task of putting out a magazine, even as small a one as this! We&#8217;d appreciate it, as we put this out, that you&#8217;d keep us in your prayers that we will print what is pleasing to the Lord and continue to glorify Him in all we do.</p>

<h2>How to Receive <i>Dear Princess</i></h2>
<p><i>Dear Princess</i> is supported by free-will offerings. We regard this magazine as not our own, but God&#8217;s and He has made it clear to us that He will supply all our needs.</p>

<p>By saying <i>Dear Princess</i> is supported by &#8220;free-will offerings,&#8221; we do not mean a sort of &#8220;pay as you can&#8221; subscription.

<h1>Notes</h1>

<p>Surprise! This issue may seem very early, when in fact, it is actually on time or even a little late. The Lord provided the means to get this out to you earlier, and we give Him all the glory.</p>

<p>As you&#8217;ll notice by reading the contents, <b>we decided to postpone our discussion on modesty,</b> as we received several, &#8220;I wanted to write, but didn&#8217;t have time&#8230;.&#8221; If you have been considering writing for this topic, please do so&#8212;you have time! However, please try to get in your articles by <b>April 1st, 1999</b>. We can extend the deadline for those of you who have a burden to write, but are running behind. We know how that is.</p>

<p>In the announcement about the modesty discussion, we noticed that we failed to mention about wanting both sides of the discussion written for&#8212;dress versus pants. We really would like to hear from both sides of the fence, from people who are honest in their convictions and desire to please the Lord, whether you wear pants or dresses. Please feel free to share with us&#8230;&#8203;we don&#8217;t desire to have a close-minded, one-sided discussion.</p>

<h2>Concerning other submissions&#8230;&#8203;</h2>
<p>Dear sisters, we need your help to fill our pages with godly, inspiring articles. Readers have written and asked, &#8220;If there is anything you need, just let me know&#8230;.&#8221; Every contribution helps. Has the Lord been burdening you to write? Has He been teaching you about something that would be of benefit to others? Just send it in! Mothers, please feel welcome to write; we need <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+2">Titus 2</a> women who are willing to write and teach us younger women. Several people have written and asked, &#8220;What about this&#8230;&#8203;would you like an article on that?&#8221; We want to make clear that we welcome all articles, and will print them as the Lord leads.</p>

<p>If any of you have ordered back issues and they have not arrived, please notify us and we will try to send some out to you again as we have been having a hard time keeping up. Thank you and we hope that we have not caused you any inconveniece.</p>

<h1>With Love, from the Editresses</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>Greetings in the precious name of Jesus! Through these intervening months since I last wrote to you the Lord has been teaching me many things&#8230;&#8203;so many that it would be hard to recount them to you in this short space I have. So I trust that the Lord will guide and direct me in what I write to you and pray that it will bless you as encouragement in serving the Lord.</p>

<p>The Lord saw fit to allow me, this autumn, to go through a rather lengthy trial, which, while not joyful at the time, brought me out, by the grace of God, <span class="scripture">&#8220;into a wealthy place.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+66%3A12" title="Psalm 66:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 66:12)</span></a></span> During the trial, the scripture, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Charity&#8230;&#8203;seeketh not her own,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+13%3A5" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 13:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 13:5)</span></a></span> kept coming back to me&#8230;&#8203;but why? It almost didn&#8217;t seem to fit&#8212;the trial involved others outside of my family&#8212;and while it included other things as well, the Lord has taught me to count all things as His and not my own. Thus if something is taken away, I know it is only the Lord taking it because He knows what is best. Slowly, through agonizing days and nights I began to understand a bit of what the Lord was trying to teach me&#8212;not to vaunt my own, not to seek that which would set the story straight of my own self and reputation and my (Lord-willing) plans. And then, during the time I thought I had got a firm grasp, by the help of the Lord, I would ache to speak out&#8230;&#8203;to &#8220;set the story straight&#8221; (as if I could anyway! Human communication is difficult under the best of circumstances). From all appearances, the Lord was telling me to willingly let myself be misunderstood&#8230;. Charity seeketh not her own. Charity does not push forward her own rights&#8230;&#8203;charity does not push for the place that God gave, even though He gave it, when it would mean strife with others.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;The servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Timothy+2%3A24" title="II&nbsp;Timothy 2:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Timothy 2:24)</span></a></span> There is a lot in those little phrases, as I learned over the weeks that seemed to stretch me so thin that I would break. Love for the Lord and His ways and love for the other persons involved kept me from not wanting to push forth and seek the place and position I felt was God-given&#8212;love seeketh not <i>her own</i>, does not vaunt itself. In that difficult time that lesson was not the only one I learned, nor was it by far the only gold I gleaned from the fire, but it seemed to carry with me everywhere&#8230;&#8203;something to be applied to not only that situation with others, but home life and in every situation.</p>

<p>Is it not easy, when you hear yourself being misquoted, to want to correct the person who is speaking about you? There are times it is quite right to correct the story and set what you said straight, but there are times when you know that if you would mention what you had really said, they would say, &#8220;You didn&#8217;t say that&#8212;you said&#8230;&#8203;&#8221; and strife would ensue.</p>

<p>Is it hard when you come into the kitchen to find a broken glass shattered on the floor&#8230;&#8203;a minute later, when you are cleaning up the mess, your little brother comes and looks in only long enough to see you cleaning it up and runs upstairs to &#8220;tell Mama.&#8221; When mother comes in, she gives a sad glance, remarks about how she wishes people would be more careful, and when you are about to explain to her that you just found the glass broken on the floor, the telephone rings and a neighbor needs some advice. By the time your mother gets off the phone, you are frying eggs for breakfast while your little sister is busy telling you about her dream she dreamed last night&#8230;&#8203;the toast is about to burn, and instead of helping, someone starts singing a song about &#8220;burnt offerings&#8221;&#8230;. There is no way, obviously you could explain now what really happened. The day wears on, with the same business we often welcome, but inside you never let go of being misrepresented and falsely accused&#8230;. And then perhaps to top it off, that evening in prayer meeting, your mother testifies how the Lord gave her grace to find that someone had been careless and had broken one of her special glasses and the blessing she got in letting go&#8230;. Is it easy to rejoice in her victory&#8230;&#8203;and not vaunt your own right? It is your &#8220;right&#8221; for the story to be clear that you did not break that special glass&#8230;&#8203;but charity vaunteth not and does not seek her own. Perhaps here it would be profitable to mention that one of the key things to winning the victory to &#8220;love seeketh not her own, does not vaunt itself,&#8221; is immediately, when you realize you have been misunderstood/wronged, <i>let go</i> completely of our natural wish to have the truth be brought to light. If we harbor a feeling of, &#8220;Well, someday&#8230;&#8203;when I can explain,&#8221; we will constantly be fighting a battle to keep the victory to obey those vital scriptures.</p>

<p>The trial I spoke of at the beginning of this letter was a large trial; sometimes I find that I have more trouble keeping the victory in those very little trials that happen a dozen times a day, such as the one in the scenario mentioned above, it is harder to live up to &#8220;love seeketh not her own, does not vaunt itself,&#8221; than if a big crisis comes and requires the selflessness that scriptures demands. In those little trials, many times I find myself thinking that, at the moment, I really don&#8217;t <i>care</i> if I&#8217;m reflecting Jesus and living out an example of those scriptures. It is then, I&#8217;ve learned, I must look to Jesus&#8212;at His example and simply follow it. For really, in my heart, I do want to do the right thing&#8212;it is only emotions that clamor to satisfy the natural nature. That is important to realize and then just set your will to follow the Lord&#8217;s example to us. People misunderstood Jesus all the time&#8230;&#8203;and never, oh, never, did He ever vaunt what was really right about himself. A place in the Bible that shows this trait most clearly is when Herod was asking Jesus mocking questions and Jesus answered&#8212;<i>nothing</i> (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+23%3A8-9">Luke 23:8-9</a>). He let go of what in the world is most prevalent today, &#8220;stick up for yourself,&#8221; &#8220;don&#8217;t allow people to step on your toes.&#8221; The spirit of Jesus is so different, the spirit He holds for us to have, so vastly opposite. If we are to be like Jesus, we must let people tramp all over our toes, let well-meaning people misunderstand us and then repeat it to others, let go of all rights (give them to Jesus), let others talk and think what they will, and look only upwards. Both in the big things and in the little, we must ask the Lord to help us from a heart full of love for our Savior, not to vaunt our own. What a blessing there is in this, what a precious lesson the Lord gave me when I took this to heart and lived out by His grace not to seek or vaunt my own, with the long trial I experienced this autumn. For yes, in due time, the Lord worked and eventually, as He has promised, <span class="scripture">&#8220;all things work[ed] together for good for them that love God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A28" title="Romans 8:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 8:28)</span></a></span> I&#8217;m so thankful that I stepped back, when the Lord told me to, did not push forward and try to make things work, but simply let go and let God. What precious gold God gave for obeying His word&#8230;. I certainly do not regret, by His grace only, being true to the Word which He gave me. You won&#8217;t regret it either, I assure you, no matter if the thing you are dealing with is a very large mountain or a tiny mole hill&#8230;&#8203;just let go and obey the Heavenly vision which the Lord gives to each one of us from His Word.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>Greetings in the precious name of our Redeemer. I pray that each of you are steadfastly looking to the Lord and learning from Him how to be holy as He is holy, giving your lives more and more to Him each day. Fall has come and gone and we&#8217;ve quickly slipped into winter with the crisp breezes and constant downfall of rain (a thing so common in Oregon that we joke about a drought in our household when any longer than a week lapses without a drop of rain.) Our lowland pasture is currently filled with a couple dozen rain puddles and it&#8217;s no uncommon thing to look out and see the small ponds overflowing.</p>

<p>Do you like rain or sunshine better? I think I could easily figure that one out.</p>

<p>Do you know that our spiritual lives seem to be like the weather in so many ways? Our soft and tender natures crave the sunshine and peace. Yet God allows a substantial amount of rain. Why? Much Afraid, in <i>Hinds&#8217; Feet on High Places</i>, shrank back with terror when the Shepherd told her that Sorrow and Suffering were to be her companions for the journey to the High Places, adding that these were two of His strongest and most able companions to help and strengthen her. When asking why she must have such companions instead of Peace and Joy, He answered, &#8220;Joy and Peace? Are those the companions you would choose for yourself? You remember your promise to accept the helpers I would give, because you believed I would chose the very best possible guides for you.</p>

<p>If we were always to have pure sunshine in life, we&#8217;d grow dry and die, as plants do without rain. Plants that are well nourished with a mixture of sun and rain, are prosperous and rich, but to be so they need those two vital ingredients. We can&#8217;t have one without the other. The Lord wants to purify unto Himself a peculiar people, refined and purged and fit vessels for His service. As Job said,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;He knoweth the way that I take: when He hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Job+23%3A10" title="Job 23:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Job 23:10)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>In asking, &#8220;Why, Lord?&#8221; we not only doubt the Lord, but we leave an open channel for the devil to bring discouragement. There&#8217;s a song in our hymnal that is an encouragement and reminder to me to give myself resignedly to the Lord, letting Him send the rain or sun as He pleases:</p>

<p class="verse">God&#8217;s way is best; if human wisdom<br />A fairer way may seem to show,<br />&#8217;Tis only that our earth-dimmed vision<br />The truth can never clearly know.</p>

<p class="verse">He leadeth true; I will not question,<br />Though through the valley I shall go;<br />Though I should pass through clouds of trial,<br />And drink the cup of human woe.</p>

<p class="verse">God&#8217;s way is best; heart, cease thy struggling<br />To see and know and understand;<br />Forsake thy fears and doubts, but trusting,<br />Submit thyself into His hand.</p>

<p class="verse">God&#8217;s way is best, I will not murmur,<br />Although the end I may not see;<br />Where&#8217;er He leads I&#8217;ll meekly follow,<br />God&#8217;s way is best, is best for me.<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Gods_Way_is_Best/index.html" title="God's Way is Best">*</a></p>

<p class="verse">&#8212;C. W. Naylor</p>

<p>To be properly equipped as a soldier of Christ&#8217;s, we need to have resignation to whatever He sends, like the above song urges. Much Afraid, after she&#8217;d been fully trust climbing the mountains for a while, finally realized that there were places where it would&#8217;ve been impossible to go, had it not been for Sorrow and Suffering. In the Christian life, there are heights of victory and blessing only available through trials and suffering. For &#8220;those who come down to the furnace go on their way afterwards as royal men and women, princes and princesses of the Royal Line.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">I mean to go right on<br />Until the crown is won;<br />I mean to fight the fight of faith<br />Till life on earth is done.<br />I&#8217;ll nevermore turn back,<br />Defeat I shall not know,<br />For God will give me victory<br />If onward I shall go.</p>

<p class="verse">Should opposition come,<br />Should foes obstruct my way,<br />Should persecution&#8217;s fires be lit,<br />As in the ancient day&#8212;<br />With Jesus by my side,<br />His peace within my soul,<br />No matter if the battle&#8217;s hot,<br />I mean to win the goal.</p>

<p class="verse">Then forward let us go,<br />Our hearts with love aflame,<br />Our snowy banner borne aloft,<br />Inscribed with Jesus&#8217; name.<br />The hosts of evil flee<br />And heaven&#8217;s open gates,<br />Invite me now to hasten where<br />Eternal glory waits.<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Im_Going_On/index.html" title="I'm Going On">*</a></p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_8/editresses_umbrella.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="282" /></div>
<p>From my own experience, I have learned that in order to properly work the trial, I must place my hand sin God&#8217;s and fully trust that He has promised not to send the rain unintended, for He said that
<span class="scripture">&#8220;all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A28" title="Romans 8:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 8:28)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>God set up a standard for His children to trust in Him in all things. As Oswald Chambers says, &#8220;It is one thing to go through a crisis grandly, but quite anothre to go through everday glorifying God.&#8221; This ins not to say that it is bad to trust the Lord through the big crissis&#8212;it is the growing ground where the lessons are learned that equip you to trust Him through evryday, with every trial. Our heart soften cry out, feeling so nearly like they willl brea with the pressure of the trial, and it is at those times when it is good to remember what David said,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+30%3A5" title="Psalm 30:5"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 30:5)</span></a></span>
The trial may be hot and the misunderstandings severe, but He has only purposed them for our ultimate best&#8212;that we may live to glorify Him and be purged of all unrighteousness. Joy cometh in the morning. Overwhelming joy and blessing, I assure you, will come after the tempest when the trial is taken as God meant.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t watch the rain and wonder why it is raining so hard or so long&#8212;look for the blessing that comes with and after the showers. Set yourself to dig for the gold that is to be obtained through the battle. Learn to <span class="scripture">&#8220;count it all joy.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+1%3A2" title="James 1:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 1:2)</span></a></span> There is no surer way to victory, when, in the midst of the trial, we can rejoice. I remember a time recently when I was facing a heavy downpouring; the devil was discouraging me and getting me worked up in the trial. The Lord brought me a song and, as soon as I could rejoice in the battle, the Lord gave the victory.</p>

<p>We only have to trust God through each day&#8212;not looking back to yesterday or worrying about tomorrow. One day, one trial. Don&#8217;t look ahead&#8212;don&#8217;t carry any unnecessary burdens. When the sorrows and sufferings oppress your heart, lean on God and look to Him to uphold you with the right hand of His righteousness. The trials will not last forever, not one more moment than is necessary. And He&#8217;s promised, <span class="scripture">&#8220;as thy days, so shall thy strength be.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Deuteronomy" title="Deuteronomy"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Deuteronomy)</span></a></span></p>

<h2>Meet a Princess: Rebecca Jo Aughinbaugh</h2>
<h1>In Acceptance Lieth Peace</h1>

<h2>Please tell us about yourself, your interests, goals and values.</h2>
<p>My name is Rebecca Jo Aughinbaugh and I am 18 years old. I live with my family on a small (25-acre) farm here in the northwest corner of Missouri. We enjoy raising and caring for a medley of livestock: cows, sheep, hogs, cats, and dogs; plus, the newest addition, a hive of bees!</p>

<p>Since a very small child, I have been fond of cows. When I was six years old my dad gave me a Holstein heifer, which I raised as a bottle calf. He taught me how to hand milk, and ever since, we have kept a few dairy animals on the place. The years have seen changes, however; now I have switched to Brown Swiss cows and milk by machine. The machine is faster and cleaner than milking by hand, but I miss the sound of the milk in the bucket and the simplicity of only one bucket to wash! I own two registered Brown Swiss cows and one heifer, plus we also have two Holsteins, the old Guernsey that I learned on, and one other grade Brown Swiss. I have a small business selling whole milk to friends.</p>

<p>On sunny, mild days, even in the dead of winter, you will likely find me in my flower garden. Last spring I decided to &#8220;overhaul&#8221; my very small, untidy flower bed. I expanded it, made a path, and put a little fence around the edge. It has given so much joy. In the fall I put in a few perennials, and I am looking forward to seeing how they do this summer. I also planted bulbs, and when I ventured onto the muddy path a few days ago to check for signs of spring, to my surprise and delight the crocuses were pushing up through the snow!</p>

<p>My other interests include piano, ear-training (learning to recognize by sound the different intervals that make up music), sewing, training my horse (a colt I raised), cooking, and studying God&#8217;s Word. I enjoy reading, and do as much as I possibly can. I&#8217;ve found that I benefit most from sticking to a few select authors and reading them over and over. For the past few months, I have been tremendously blessed by the insights of author Hannah Hurnard. My life can never be the same since reading these books: <i>Winged Life</i>, <i>God&#8217;s Transmitters</i>, <i>Kingdom of Love</i>, and of course the classics, <i>Hind&#8217;s Feet on High Places</i> and <i>Mountains of Spices</i>. The scriptures have opened up to me and my love for them has increased. I know I am just beginning to uncover the hidden treasures the Lord is waiting to reveal to me; my only sorrow is that I have been blind to basic truths for so long. The patience and long suffering of my Lord with me is just beautiful beyond words. I would highly recommend these books to all.</p>

<h2>Please tell us about your family.</h2>
<p>My dad&#8217;s name is Joe. He is a rural mail carrier; he delivers our mail every day! This job takes up most of his time, but he has seasonal sidelines such as shearing a few sheep, and raising chickens and turkeys for our freezer. He has a sense of humor and a lot of common sense. When we have questions or a problem, Dad always knows the best thing to do!</p>

<p>My mother&#8217;s name is Glenda. Her interests center around growing things&#8212;from flowers to vegetables or herbs; from saving seed, to using herbs medicinally and figuring out ways to store our produce over winter&#8230;&#8203;she is deeply interested in all aspects of gardening and being more self-sufficient. She is blessed with robust health and strength, and practically lives outdoors from spring to fall! She is relying on the Lord for grace to accept His will this spring&#8230;&#8203;to be content with life indoors nursing Grandma is sometimes a struggle, because she is missing the excitement of getting the garden started as the new season bursts forth.</p>

<p>I have one sibling, my brother Adam; he is 16. I am very thankful for him&#8212;he has taught me many things, in some ways indirectly. We have a very close relationship! It is nice to have a &#8220;protector&#8221; when we go places alone, and he helps me out so much with chores, doing all the heavy lifting. In turn, I enjoy surprising him with baked &#8220;goodies.&#8221; I am so grateful God gave me a brother! Adam&#8217;s main interest right now is raising hogs. It started with just fattening feeder pigs for market; now he has three sows that have just weaned their first litters. They were cute for a while (he thinks they still are) but so mischievious! Always getting out and underfoot!</p>

<h2>Is there any special blessing from the Lord you&#8217;d like to share?</h2>
<p>I have so many special testimonies of God&#8217;s goodness I could share! It is overwhelming to think about. I know that many of you will identify with this feeling.</p>

<p>It seems appropriate to share how the Lord is sustaining our family at the present time&#8230;.</p>

<p>My mother&#8217;s parents live about 9 miles north of us on the farm where she was raised. On January 20, my grandma, who has osteoporosis, was putting letters in the mailbox when she slipped and fell, breaking her hip. The (difficult!) decision was made to nurse her at home, instead of going to the hospital. Over the years, my mother has gained much experience and wisdom in the use of herbs for healing, so she has been taking care of Grandma full time since that date. My grandpa also has health problems, and before Grandma fell, she was quite busy keeping up with his requirements&#8230;&#8203;so Mom has two patients!</p>

<p>Grandma is completely bedfast, so for over a month they all have been up every few hours around the clock, turning her and attending to her needs. Only one of Mom&#8217;s five siblings lives close enough to share in the care of Grandma&#8212;Aunt Ruth lives 60 miles away, but has been coming up and staying a few days at a time so Mom can get a little break.</p>

<p>My responsibilities have increased since Mom left. Looking back, it is amazing how the Lord was preparing me to take over for her, in the weeks and months leading up to the accident. We had a calf that was sick, and Mom was spending a great deal of time in the barn taking care of it, and studying what herbs to use. So I began helping out more with the meal planning and preparation, taking over completely at times. Also, I have had poor health for several years; headaches and fatigue have been my daily companions (and have taught me many lessons&#8212;but that&#8217;s another story). Last fall I began improving, and about ten days before the accident I was well enough to take over the morning milking again. For over a year Mom has done that because I have always felt so bad in the mornings. He really provided for me&#8212;there is no way I would&#8217;ve been able to do all I am doing now if my health hadn&#8217;t improved.</p>

<p>Since Mom is my closest friend as well as my mother, I have really missed her! I realized that if I was truly anchored on Jesus Christ, He would satisfy all my needs for companionship. It has really driven me closer to the Lord, to leaning totally on Him.</p>

<p>Since I can&#8217;t share all my thoughts and testimonies with Mom as we work together, I have turned instead to my journal to express what I am feeling. It is not quite as easy to write things as to speak them&#8212;it requires more care. One of my faults is just speaking my thoughts and ideas as they come to me! I hope I am maybe learning to be quiet and think things through more, before sharing.</p>

<p>I have been blessed by my mother&#8217;s silent testimony as she gives all her time and strength in caring for the needs of others. It has been a physically exhausting job as well as emotionally stressful to her. (She wanted me to be sure and add that the Lord has really blessed her to be able to serve without resentment&#8212;it is a gift from Him, and only His grace enables any of us to accept His will for our lives at this time without growing bitter.) We know that <span class="scripture">&#8220;all things work together for good,&#8221;</span> and that the Lord is teaching us lessons that will ultimately be for His glory. I know we will look back on this time, in the future, and be able to see more clearly the working of His hand.</p>

<h2>Would you mind sharing a favorite book, poem, or recipe?</h2>
<p>I hope this poem will bless your readers as much as it has me. It has been a source of strength and comfort, especially in the recent weeks:</p>

<p class="verse">In acceptance lieth peace,<br />O my heart be still;<br />Let thy restless worries cease<br />And accept His will.<br />Though this test be not thy choice,<br />It is His&#8212;therefore rejoice.</p>

<p class="verse">In His plan there cannot be<br />Aught to make thee sad:<br />If this is His choice for thee,<br />Take it and be glad.<br />Make from it some lovely thing<br />To the glory of thy King.</p>

<p class="verse">Cease from sighs and murmuring,<br />Sing His loving grace,<br />This thing means thy furthering<br />To a wealthy place.<br />From thy fears He&#8217;ll give release,<br />In acceptance lieth peace.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8212;Hannah Hurnard</p>

<p>I would also like to share our favorite brownie recipe; it is the result of some &#8220;tweaking&#8221; of a recipe to get something similar to the mixes you can buy:</p>

<h3>Rebecca&#8217;s Brownies</h3>
<ul class="recipe">
<li>3/4 c. cocoa</li>

<li>2/3 c. plus 4 T. shortening, butter, or oil</li>

<li>2 c. Sucanat (or sugar)</li>

<li>2 eggs</li>

<li>1 t. vanilla</li>

<li>1 1/2 c. whole spelt flour (or 1 1/4 c. white)</li>

<li>1 t. baking powder</li>

<li>1 t. salt</li>

</ul>
<p>If using shortening or butter, melt in a large saucepan with the cocoa. (If using oil, combine oil and cocoa). Remove from heat. Mix in Sucanat, eggs and vanilla. Stir in remaining ingredients. Spread in greased 9x13-inch pan. Bake 20 minutes at 350 degrees. Let cool slightly before cutting. These are very moist and chewy&#8212;be careful not to overbake!</p>

<h2>In conclusion, is there anything else you&#8217;d like to add?</h2>
<p>My prayer is that the Lord will use my attempt at sharing with you in this interview, somehow for His glory. In closing, I would pass on what He has patiently been trying to teach me lately: The Lord is faithful. He knows what He is doing in your life even when it doesn&#8217;t make sense. Just trust Him and lay your will down on the altar. Cling to Him during those periods of trial and disappointment. His Word will bring you comfort and strength.</p>

<p>He will bless you beyond your highest expectations!</p>

<h1>From the Hearts of Our Readers</h1>

<hr class="minor" />
<p class="noindent">My Dear Skye,</p>

<p>How is everyone in your household? I&#8217;m sorry to hear you have had colds! This fall I was sick off and on for at least a month, but I think it has finally left. Praise God! We normally have our share of colds, too, but thankfully everyone is feeling fine.</p>

<p>How was your Christmas? I think I mentioned ours in my note, didn&#8217;t I? Do you do anything for New Year&#8217;s? I always make plenty of New Year&#8217;s goals, resolutions, and prayers. A couple for this year were:</p>

<ul>
<li>to develop the habit of rising before the sun</li>

<li>to develop a better prayer life</li>

<li>to keep up with my pen pals</li>

<li>to learn 100 verses to hymns</li>

<li>to be a better servant to others</li>

<li>to spend more &#8220;fun time&#8221; with my brothers</li>

<li>to walk outside everyday (but Sunday) for at least 10 min.</li>

<li>to learn to iceskate.</li>

</ul>
<p>I realize that not one of these will come to pass without the will and guidance of God. Praise Him because He does not leave us in our weakness, but gives us His strength through the Holy Spirit!</p>

<p>God has been working in my life in many areas&#8212;may I share them with you?</p>

<p>First, I am s-l-o-w-l-y learning the <i>necessity</i> of getting up early! Just today I read a chapter on the verse in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+31%3A15">Proverbs 31:15</a> in the book <i>The Excellent Woman</i> (copyright 1800&#8217;s?), which really convicted me. Part of it reads, &#8220;Early risers will not often be found among those whose habits are irregular and disorderly. The practice of beginning the work with the commencement of the day is almost always found in conjuction with punctual and diligent habits, and with the love of order and management.&#8221; This is so true of me. When I get up late and don&#8217;t have time for God and adequate time for getting myself ready for the day, everything is off-schedule, rushed, and nothing gets done! What a meaningless life I would live if it was made up of days like this!</p>

<p>Another thing the book said was that one should have so much to do (spending time with God, serving others, daily tasks, etc.) that you <i>must</i> get up early. Idle, lazy lives can never glorify God.</p>

<p>Secondly, God is showing me not to be an unstable, double-minded friend. I&#8217;m not sure if you ever feel this way, but I find it so easy to change my personality, attitudes, even language with different people I&#8217;m around. (Hopefully never in a <i>bad</i> way&#8212;just a different way.) With those who are more &#8220;conservative&#8221; I tend to cover up my faults and seem sweet and godly. With those who are worldly I tend to act more at-their-level and try to hide my convictions/differences. Both are wrong. I know I need to believe what the Lord has shown me through His Word and my parents, and live this way before all people alike.</p>

<p>Thirdly, I have been realizing my weakness or inconsistency in prayer. Prayer is really so vital in a Christian&#8217;s life. Requests for prayer on many different things literally bombard me and I end up crumpling and not praying for anything. Please pray for me that a true love and desire to talk to God would reign <i>constantly</i> in my soul. &#8220;We pray without ceasing when we unceasingly retain true love and true desire in our hearts. Love, hidden in the soul, prays constantly, even when the mind is drawn another way.&#8221; &#8212;Anonymous.</p>

<p>I really desire to spend time talking to God and lifting up petitions to Him because I know this is what He wants from me. So often we turn this into a task like having a list we recite or watching a clock for &#8220;15 minutes of prayer&#8221; each morning. How would I like it if my friends treated me like that?!</p>

<p>Wow&#8212;I have so far to go; and it is only by th~ grace of God that I have come so far.</p>

<p><i>Dear Princess</i> is such a blessing to me. Each issue gets better and better. I do appreciate all the work you and Abigail do for it. I&#8217;m sure it is touching more souls than just mine!</p>

<p>Amy Zander&#8217;s interview was excellent! Now I <i>really</i> want to meet her. Just think, we used to live only about two hours from each other a year and a half ago.</p>

<p>Mrs. Spinks&#8217; poem was beautiful&#8212;one I&#8217;d like to frame and hang in my room to constantly remember. How easy it is to forget your &#8220;royalty.&#8221; I&#8217;m a princess&#8212;I <i>really</i> am!</p>

<p>Heather Eley&#8217;s story was incredible. Praise be to God for the way it worked out! I wonder if I could be that strong if my mother died. I&#8217;m sure it took a lot of strength to cling to God and trust Him, yet our God is faithful and holds us in the palm of His hands all the days of our lives. Heather&#8217;s testimony was a true blessing.</p>

<p>We are finally starting to feel a little settled in our home. We have loads of remodeling to do (and cleaning!) but it is truly a fun place to live. We are so excited to garden again this spring. We are planting a lot because of the potential problems in the year 2000 (computers). We aren&#8217;t packing up and moving, or stocking gold and guns, but we are trying to become a little more self-sufficient&#8212;a good way to be anyway!</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+40%3A28" title="Isaiah 40:28"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 40:28)</span></a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Abigail,</p>

<p>Greetings in the everlasting name of our Savior!&#8230;&#8203;I&#8217;ve thought of you often and decided to take this bit of spare time [today] to sit down and write&#8230;.</p>

<p>The Lord has been teaching me many things&#8230;&#8203;well, it would take pages and pages to tell all of it! I&#8217;ll try to write enough to give you a small part of the picture&#8230;. I&#8217;ve really felt recently that I need to spend more time with my Lord in prayer and Bible reading. I once heard a saying: &#8220;you are as real as your quiet time.&#8221; So this is something I really desire to improve on!</p>

<p>We have been as busy as bees lately! October 24th marked the one-year anniversary of our family moving to Idaho. In that one year, we&#8217;ve moved five times! First in town, for about 6 months. Then we lived in the travel trailer for four months. Next we spent a month in a motel (doing the motel laundry in exchange for our rent!) Then we lived with some friends for a month. Now, here we are on our own property, in our own mobile home! We&#8217;ve been cleaning, sorting, packing and unpacking, remodeling and settling in. It&#8217;s really starting to look and feel like home now!</p>

<p>The Lord has been teaching our whole family about faith&#8212;trusting in God to provide our needs. He has blessed us in so many ways, so we know it must have been the Lord&#8217;s hand. Sometimes we get discouraged, but it helps to remember Who is in control.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to the next issue of <i>DP</i>. I&#8217;m so glad you wanted to send me an issue last summer, it&#8217;s really been a blessing. May the Father in Heaven bless you in all you do!</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Abigail,</p>

<p>Greetings in the precious name of Jesus!&#8230;&#8203;</p>

<p>We have been very busy this past week. We are having a lot of work done on our house, and today, after 3 days of work, a man finished redoing a wood floor for us. It was kind of a busy weekend because the floor she was working on, we couldn&#8217;t walk on until after he was done and it dried and the floor happened to be in the most central room in the house. So&#8230;&#8203;up went ladders to the bedroom windows, so we could get to different rooms of the house. It was quite an adventure. To top it off we <i>all</i> were sick with the flu before that and we all still felt a little weak and tired. We had a small, little day-trip planned, so we could leave the house while the guy was doing our floor, but we got sick and couldn&#8217;t go.</p>

<p>I think the Lord was trying to teach me contentment, because I really wanted to go. And then I got sick and when I got better I was so thankful for my health. The Lord is showing me that I need to be content with what I have and not take my health, my home, the food I eat, and my family for granted. He&#8217;s blessed me with so much. My contentment needs to be placed in Him and not in anything I do or have or anywhere I go.</p>

<p>Earlier this week I had been battling with not feeling close to the Lord and not feeling like I had grown at all the week before. I was just feeling very dry. Mom and Dad encouraged me when I talked to them, and told me to not strive, but to rest and they said the Lord sometimes has those times for us just to rest in Him, praise Him, and &#8220;live&#8221; what He&#8217;s already taught me. I can&#8217;t go higher if I&#8217;m not walking in what He&#8217;s already shown me. They also said that God is building the foundation in my life, and the foundation to a house is the most important part, yet unseen. I need to walk by faith, not by sight. It was a great encouragement to me and I have been blessed this week and am feeling closer to the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> be magnified.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalms+40%3A16" title="Psalms 40:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalms 40:16)</span></a></span> I need to rejoice and be glad in the Lord, and magnify His name continually. I need to be so thankful for my salvation and that I&#8217;m able to seek Him.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_8/readers_children.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="226" /></div>
<p>Well, I don&#8217;t want to close and cut this short, but I have to go to bed and if I don&#8217;t finish now, who knows when it will get sent?</p>

<p>May the Lord richly bless you.</p>

<p>Dear Friends&#8212;</p>

<p>Merry Christmas!</p>

<p>My heart rejoices in seeing the Lord&#8217;s blessing upon the works of your hands! He will faithfully reward our walking in obedience to Him and surrender to His will with the powerful works of His own hand in and through our lives. Bless you for continuing in your work in faith&#8230;.</p>

<p>Our family has been through another deep trial that brought many tears and much pain. Thanks be to God who is our dearest Comforter. We have come through, triumphing in faith&#8212;our falterings come when we wonder what the future holds; but we have an almighty God who loves us dearly and who also holds the future in His hands. Please pray for us. Nothing hurts more than when it touches your own home and family.</p>

<p>The Lord is faithful. His plans and ways are so beyond our human reasonings. When things are beyond our control and beyond our efforts to right (the problems) because they are in His control and it is in His right hand of power to right all that&#8217;s wrong.</p>

<p>Thank you for the story of the Eley family. It was a great encouragement. The time is coming when we will be asked to back our beliefs and faith with all of ourselves&#8212;-our very lives. Indeed, it is already come because those who <i>will</i> live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. God&#8217;s protection over our souls is greater than any danger that faces us. He is God and what He has spoken, He surely will do.</p>

<p>Unto Him be all the glory and honor! May it be reflected in all its beauty in His bride, His beloved church.</p>

<p class="noindent">Dearest Skye,</p>

<p>I trust that the Lord has been faithful to strengthen you through your recent trials. Your attitude through this is an inspiration and a great tribute to the grace of God. I&#8217;ve just finished reading Amy Carmichael&#8217;s <i>Gold By Moonlight</i> (have you read that?), and her passages on suffering are both tender and bracing:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wind means stress and strain. &#8216;The elastic limit&#8217; of each kind of tree is known to the engineer, and he deals accordingly with his timber. So does the Creator of the trees, the Commander of the winds, know &#8216;the elastic limit&#8217; of His several trees. And He knows the weight of the winds&#8230;. &#8216;Nothing but the Infinite Pity is sufficient for the infinite pathos of human life,&#8217; but that is only half a truth. Nothing but the courageous love of God is brave enough to trust the soul of man to endure as seeing Him who is invisible; and nothing but the grace of God can carry that soul through in triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have as much grace for you as I have green for My trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, 0 my soul, settle it with thyself that thou wilt listen to no hard reports which the ills of this present time may make to thee concerning thy Lord, for &#8216;nothing can come wrong from my Lord in His sweet working.&#8217; Not clouds and dark woods, for they are lighted; not the deep ravine, for it leads to the heights; not snow, for it can cherish; not ruin, for &#8216;He can make one web of contraries&#8217;; not rough waters, for they cannot overflow me; not steep mountains, for when I said, &#8216;My foot slippeth,&#8217; Thy mercy, O Lord, held me up; not dark woods again, for I do not build my nest in any tree on earth; not walls, for they have windows; not storms, for they cannot uproot me; not loneliness, for I am not alone. &#8216;Only be thou strong and very courageous,&#8217; is Thy word to me, O Lord. <span class="scripture">&#8216;As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. Be strong and of a good courage.&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Joshua+1%3A5-6" title="Joshua 1:5-6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Joshua 1:5-6)</span></a></span>&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hendry told a story on her testimony tape that I had never heard before and whose illustration has recurred to me many times in the couple weeks since I heard it, and that is this: A little boy told his daddy he had fifty cents and wanted to go to the store and buy a bicycle. &#8220;Okay,&#8221; said his daddy, and took him there. After they&#8217;d looked at all the bicycles and the child had chosen his favorite, his father said, &#8220;Now give me your fifty cents and go wait for me in the car, and I&#8217;ll bring it out.&#8221; And so while the boy waited in the car, the father took the fifty cents to the cashier, added his own $99.50, and bought the bike for his son.</p>

<p>The next day the boy again had fifty cents, and this time he decided he wanted a model train, but instead of seeking his father&#8217;s help he went to the store on his own. &#8220;Hello,&#8221; he said to the clerk, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to buy a model train&#8221;&#8212;and he held out his fifty cents.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; the clerk said, &#8220;but a model train costs far, far more than fifty cents.</p>

<p>&#8220;But yesterday I bought a bike for fifty cents!&#8221; the child exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; replied the clerk, &#8220;but yesterday you had your father with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Mrs. Hendry pointed out that while some days we may not even feel&#8212;because of our health or our background or our weariness or our inabilities&#8212;that we have even fifty cents to offer the challenges presented us, but only, maybe, twenty-five cents&#8212;is the Lord not just as capable of making up the extra $99.75 as the $99.50? And in the midst of the many challenges always involved with getting an issue out, I have been much encouraged to remember that it matters little what I have or don&#8217;t have in myself to meet them&#8212;only that I offer back to Him all that He&#8217;s given and say, &#8220;Lord, here is all I have&#8212;do as Thou wilt with it.&#8221; And His strength is more than sufficient for any human need.</p>

<p>The battles continue on other fronts, though, and what do you do? He <i>is</i> abundantly able to keep us from falling, but can we pray <span class="scripture">&#8220;lead us not into temptation,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+6%3A13%3B+Luke+11%3A4" title="Matthew 6:13; Luke 11:4"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 6:13; Luke 11:4)</span></a></span> and then walk right into situations we know will be rife with it? It can be so hard to say no, and to say it in the right way, though! You want to keep the relationship with the family members, you want to be a good witness, you want to be loving and gracious and humble, yet you <i>know</i> you can&#8217;t compromise and turn your gaze from His kingdom and His righteousness, that if it comes to a choice you must seek Him&#8230;. For what profit <i>would</i> it be could we gain the whole world and lose our own souls&#8212;or win their friendship today through compromise but lose them for all eternity?</p>

<p>Okay. I&#8217;ll quit, for I can&#8217;t wait to hear from you.</p>

<h1>A Worthwhile Job</h1>

<p>Isn&#8217;t it frustrating when you have finished the dishes, and half an hour later your services are needed to wash the dishes used in preparing the next meal? It has been frustrating for me. All my work is seemingly undone and I am faced with almost the same task as before.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ecclesiastes+3%3A14" title="Ecclesiastes 3:14"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ecclesiastes 3:14)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>Can dishes be done foever? &#8220;Ha! Dishes done forever!?&#8221;</p>

<p>It all depends on how you do them.</p>

<p>If I wash the dishes with Jesus, with His grace reigning in my heart, having a cheerful, sweet disposition, then those dishes are done forever&#8212;they will never have to be done again!</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+6%3A10" title="Galatians 6:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Galatians 6:10)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Opportunities are everywhere!</p>

<p>Especially opportunities to do dishes! But there are many other things also, like tasks which grate on our nerves. These, if we ask Jesus to come and help us, can be accomplished, and good be done.</p>

<p><a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+25%3A15-30">Matthew 25:15-30</a>&#8212;God has given us talents.</p>

<p>In my family and friends, there are manifested many talents, and some I have, and some I don&#8217;t. A lesson in this parable is very clear to me: we are to work in our own talent&#8212;think of it as a job, a responsibility. We shouldn&#8217;t concentrate on another&#8217;s talent (wishing we had it)&#8212;we have our own to attend.</p>

<p>Some jobs seem worth more than others&#8212;like the &#8220;five talents&#8221; and &#8220;two talents.&#8221; Yet the Lord said unto each that had faithfully labored with his talent, <span class="scripture">&#8220;enter thou into the joy of thy lord.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>The blessing of the Lord is worth all the labor, even if your talent seems like nothing important&#8212;it was important enough that the Lord gave it to you, right?</p>

<p>&#8212;C.S.</p>

<h1>Fruit of Her Hands</h1>

<p>To each of you dear girls:</p>

<p>It has been on my heart for some time that a column be given to teach about home making skills. I feel very dependent upon the Lord in undertaking this task, as writing doesn&#8217;t come naturally. It would be much easier to teach in person, but we want to be a blessing and share some of our experiences.</p>

<p>I am sure most of you are acquainted with <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Titus+2">Titus 2</a> in which it teaches the older women to teach the younger to love their husband and their children. The best time for this is while you girls are still at home. It&#8217;s a little late after you are out of the home! Oh, girls, make good use of your time now. You have more time now than you will ever have to avail yourself of the many skills it takes to order a well-run home. Once it was heard of a girl who was just planning on going to college for a time-killer before she got married. How sad! Girls such as this will surely come to a sad end. There are so many interesting skills to learn&#8212;more even than time will permit. Seek the Lord in your endeavors. He knows the future and what will be the most important for you and your future family.</p>

<p>Before marriage I had learned to bake bread and was eager to bake for my new husband, but to my surprise he was accustomed to a certain store brand and really didn&#8217;t care for mine. But in later years, I researched bread-making and found certain ingredients made a lighter loaf and developed a recipe that he just loves. I could not have done this if I hadn&#8217;t already known how to bake bread. Learning to bake bread as a girl at home was an important step even though at first it didn&#8217;t look like the skill was needed in my own home. Now, would you believe, he calls that store-bought bread &#8220;sawdust bread,&#8221; and will hardly eat any other than mine!</p>

<p>Are you ready for a bread-making lesson?</p>

<p>If so, we have pulled one of our favorites from our recipe files to share with you.</p>

<h2>Buttermilk-Oat Bread</h2>
<p>In a large bowl, if doing by hand (or Magic Mill, Bosch, or K-Tech Mixer bowls) combine:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>2 1/2 c. very hot water (almost boiling)</li>

<li>1/2 c. buttermilk, whey, yogurt <i>or</i> 1 T. lemon juice in 1/2 c. sweet milk</li>

<li>1/2 c. quick oats</li>

<li>1/2 c. wheat bran or toasted wheat germ</li>

<li>1/2 c. dry milk<br />1/3 c. honey <i>or</i> sugar<br />1 egg<br />1 T. oil</li>

</ul>
<p>Add:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>2 c. White Better-for-Bread Flour</li>

</ul>
<p>Beat Well. Mixture should now be warm&#8212;not hot&#8212;approximately 105-115 degrees.</p>

<p>In another smaller bowl combine:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>2 c. hard white wheat flour</li>

<li>4 t. yeast</li>

<li>1 T. salt (canning or sea)</li>

<li>1 1/2 T. gluten flour</li>

<li>1 1/2 T. Soy Lecithin granules<br />1/4 t. vitamin C crystals</li>

</ul>
<p>Mix these ingredients together very well and add to the big bowl of warm, wet ingredients. Beat on high for 5 min.</p>

<p>Let this sponge rise 20 min. For added nutrition, at this point I put:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>1/4 c. raw sunflower seeds</li>

<li>1/4 c. pumpkin seeds</li>

<li>2 T. sesame seeds</li>

</ul>
<p>into the food processor or blender and chop them so finely nobody will ever know they are eating it! When the timer rings for the sponge mixture, add the chopped seeds and:</p>

<ul class="recipe">
<li>approx. 4 c. more of Better-for-Bread Flour&#8212;don&#8217;t just dump it in! Add 1 cup at a time!</li>

</ul>
<div class="right"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_8/hands_bread_a.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="81" /></div>
<p>Knead 5-10 min. until it is no longer sticky when touched with floured hands. Place in a greased bowl and cover with plastic or a damp towel to keep the top from drying out.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_8/hands_bread_b.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="119" /></div>
<p>Let it rise in a warm place of even heat (80 degrees or so) for 1 hour. When the hour is up&#8212;the dough should be double in size. Let&#8217;s do the &#8220;finger poke test&#8221;&#8212;put moistened finger 1/2&#8221; into center of dough. If it still feels very firm, let it rise more. If it feels spongy, the hole stays and the bread &#8220;sighs&#8221; slightly, it&#8217;s ready!</p>

<p>Now, instead of &#8220;punching it down,&#8221; deflate gently. More care here means higher bread. Moisten hands with water and press gently in center, then flatten around sides. With a rubber spatula, carefully dislodge the underside of dough from bowl pouring out on a lightly greased table. Round the dough with your hands. Divide in 3rds. Round into 3 mounds and let rest 10 minutes. Roll out in approximately 8x15-inch rectangle. This presses out large gas bubbles. Now roll up as pictured. Place in greased pan and let rise 30-40 minutes.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_8/hands_bread_c.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="77" /></div>
<p>The baker&#8217;s term for this last rising is called &#8220;proofing.&#8221; This rising will benefit from a little warmer temperature. Also a humid atmosphere will keep the top from drying out or cover with a big bread bag (cut open), or damp towel.</p>

<p>At the end of the proofing time, you should see small gas bubbles just under the surface. Experience only can teach you when it has risen just to the right point. If it falls during baking, it rose too much. It should look puffy and when touched gently, puffs out again.</p>

<p>Bake at 325 degrees for 30-40 minutes. Remove from pan and cool on rack. An electric knife greatly aids in slicing or use a long bladed serrated knife.</p>

<p>Happily serve your family, and <span class="scripture">&#8220;eat thy bread with joy.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ecclesiastes+9%3A7" title="Ecclesiastes 9:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ecclesiastes 9:7)</span></a></span></p>

<h2>Helpful Tips for the Breadmaker</h2>
<ul>
<li>Oats make a moist bread and add good flaver.</li>

<li>Don&#8217;t ever use walnuts&#8212;they turn the bread dark, and it tastes funny, too!</li>

<li>Hard red wheat flour may be used, but you will get a darker product. If you are using fleshly-ground flour, heap each cup.</li>

<li>The gluten, soy lecithin and vitamin C are dough conditioners. They help in having a high, light loaf.</li>

<li>Saf-Instant is the best and most economical yeast when bourght by the pound package.</li>

<li>Be careful not to use raw wheat germ or iodized salt&#8212;they can retard yeast action.</li>

<li>Do you know why just this temperature? If yeast gets too hot at this point, the yeast will kill it and the bread will not rise properly.</li>

<li>In front of a wood stove is a great place to let dough rise. I&#8217;ve even heard of ladies using a heating pad on medium setting! I would cover the heating pad with a towel to diffuse the heat. Remmeber, we don&#8217;t want to kill the yeast.</li>

<h1>How to Make Cheese</h1>

<p class="author">Claire Varney</p>

<p>Most of us buy cheese in the store&#8212;but have you ever wondered if you could make it yourself, without any special types of equipment? Well, you can! And the following will explain.</p>

<p>The recipe for the first cheese I made, I got from a recipe booklet in a Junket Rennet box. The first thing to do is to buy some junket rennet. This can be found among the baking accessories in a major supermarket, or in a health food store. Cheese rennet will not work satisfactorily, unless you know how much more concentrated it is than Junket Rennet, and can modify the amount accordingly. And make sure you have milk, buttermilk, and salt on hand; cream would be nice, although I didn&#8217;t use it. Next you should probably decide on how much cheese you want in return. The recipe I will give makes a cup, but if you&#8217;re going to take the time to make it, you may as well increase the recipe.</p>

<p>As soon as you have the ingredients listed, you are ready to start; but read through the directions first, so you know when to be around. And, preferably, don&#8217;t start in the morning unless you plan to be up really late.</p>

<p>To begin with, dissolve 1/16 of a rennet tablet in 1/8 cup tepid water and set mixture aside. In a large saucepan, heat one quart of skim milk to 70 degrees F., watching it constantly. Remove the pan from the heat source, and stir in the Rennet Tablet solution and the buttermilk, mixing it well. Cover the pan with a towel or plate and let it stand at room temperature 12 to 18 hours until a firm curd has formed. If you keep your house cool at night, you may need to leave it longer. When the curd is firm, it will hold its shape and have sharply (more orless) defined edges when a sample is removed from the edges of a saucepan with a spoon. The next step is to cut the curd into 1/2 inch long pieces with a long knife. Heat the curd slowly over hot water until its temperature reaches 110 degrees F. (If you don&#8217;t have a double boiler large enough, this set-up can be obtained by nesting a pot large enough to hold the amount of milk you are using, in a pot a little deeper and 2 inches in diameter wider, and then filling the space in between the pots with water.) Hold the curd at this temperature for 20 to 30 minutes, stirring it at 5 minutes intervals to heat the curd uniformly. Then, pour the mixture onto a loosely woven piece of cloth laid out in a colander and allow the whey to drain into a bowl. After the whey has drained 2 to 3 minutes, lift the edges of the cloth and immerse the curd in a container of cold water 1 to 2 minutes, gently stirring and pressing with a spoon. When this time is up, immerse it in ice water 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the curd from the water and drain it until it is free from whey, as the whey will make the cheese very sour. Invert the cloth into a bowl, dumping out the curd, and add 1/4 teaspoon salt. You may add cream or milk as well, but if milk is added, it would be advisable to eat the curds promptly. The rennet seems to act upon the milk, making sour whey. The curds could also be kept dry until shortly before use; this may extend their refrigerator life.</p>

<p>The recipe for the second type of cheese I made is probably one of the easiest around, and a good one to start with. However, due to the ingredients it may be more to build your enthusiasm and give you the main idea of how cheese is formed than anything else. All you need is some milk, a lemon, and a heat source.</p>

<p>To begin with, heat a cup of milk (or multiply the recipe as you desire) in a sauce pan and add a tablespoon of lemon juice.</p>

<p>Continue to heat the mixture until very small curds rise to the surface and until the whey is more yellowish than white. Then, remove your pan from the heat and pour its contents into a light-weight piece of fabric, stretched over a bowl. The whey will drain through into the bowl, leaving the cheese behind. If you desire a dry cheese, leave it to drain for an hour or two, suspended by a piece of string tied to a cabinet handle, or hung on a kitchen faucet. Otherwise, squeeze out the excess liquid, cool, and enjoy! I found this cheese good on wheat drop biscuits, hot from the oven, which were made with the whey. On cold bread, etc., it wasn&#8217;t notably good.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_8/cheese_cheddar.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="244" /></div>
<p>Perhaps by now you are getting a bit impatient; you thought you were going to be told how to make cheeses like those most commonly bought&#8212;Cheddar, Monterey, etc. Well, following is a description of my first experiment at hard cheese making; I will note where I erred, so that you may learn from my mistakes and not from your own.</p>

<p>arranged by placing one plate face down on a surface and placing the other plate on top, right side up. I piled five 1 1/2 inch-thick encyclopedias on top and left it for about an hour. I then removed the cheese from my homemade press, heated the whey I had saved to 180 degrees, placed the cheese in the whey, and left it until the whey had cooled to room temperature (15 hours or so). I took the cheese out of the whey and left it to drain in a colander for 20 hours. When that time had lapsed, it was ready to eat. Save the whey to use in breads in place of milk or water. It contains most of the minerals from the milk, and will not adversely affect the taste of your baked delights.</p>

<p>Notes: Another way to press the cheese is to return it to the colander after tying it, place a plate on the cheese, and put a gallon jugof water on the plate. Leave it overnight. You can then remove the cheese from the cloth, wrap it in a dry napkin, and place it in the refrigerator without putting it back in the whey or anything.</p>

<p>Happy Cheesemaking!</p>

<h1>The Garment of Womanhood</h1>

<p class="author">Sister Patsy Cain</p>

<p>Greetings to all my dear sisters in the Lord. What a privilege to have sisters of the Spirit with whom we can share His precious dealings!</p>

<p>When Moses stood on holy ground, God said to him, <span class="scripture">&#8220;What is that in thine hand?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Exodus+4%3A2" title="Exodus 4:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Exodus 4:2)</span></a></span> It was only a lowly, insignificant staff, but because Moses surrendered it, it became a symbol of God&#8217;s power, and a mighty weapon in the work Moses was called to do. What is in our hands? Our womanhood. God has called each of us, in our peculiar circumstances, to fill a beautiful, noble place that no one else can fill, and the gifts and attributes of our womanhood, if we will give them fully to God.</p>

<p>To &#8220;wrap the garment of womanhood about us&#8221; means to accept completely the submissive role God has given us as women. In order to be pleasing to God and effectively do His work in the world, we must be in submission, first to Him and then to our husbands. Submission means dying out to self and giving up self will and personal ambition. When we do that, the ugliness of self will be covered by the beautiful garment of womanhood. The Bible speaks of a woman&#8217;s outward beauty or profession of religion being marred by a lack of discretion of an unbridled tongue; those are the things sub mission, or the garment of womanhood, will cover, leaving only His graces to shine through us.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll tell you a story about myself that illustrates this. One time my husband came home upset because his brother had called him at work making an unreasonable demand for money, and he had agreed to it. He said there was no way out of it; we would have to give his brother that money. I got upset as well, and began saying such things as, &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to do what he tells you to do,&#8221; and &#8220;We can&#8217;t afford to give him that much money,&#8221; and so on. Picture it for yourself. At once the Lord checked me, and I said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t talk about this; I need to go pray.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob said, &#8220;About this situation?&#8221;</p>

<p>And I said, &#8220;No, for myself. My attitude is wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even before I got on my knees the Lord was talking to me: &#8220;You owe your husband an apology. He deserves to be able to come home and tell you what&#8217;s bothering him, and get your best thinking and advice on the situation, without being reproached and made to feel worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was so sorry and repentant! I said, &#8220;Yes, Lord! Forgive me. I&#8217;ll apologize to him, and listen to him, and with Your help try to work out the best way for all of us. Thank you!&#8221;</p>

<p>I got up from my knees feeling happy, and as I started out of the bedroom the Lord spoke again and said, &#8220;And I&#8217;ll take care of the other problem.&#8221; What victory! What covering of my ugly self by the beautiful garment of submission! I apologized to Bob, told him I&#8217;d listen without criticism, and when I told him the Lord would take care of the problem, he wept. When my brother-in-law (who had been angry at me for weeks) came to the door, I met him with a smile and told him I loved him, and he wept! The whole situation dissolved to nothing, and the two brothers spent a congenial evening together.</p>

<p>Sisters, our most powerful weapon against sin and self is submission. When we submit to God and our husbands, Christ clothes us &#8220;with His perfect righteousness imputed, which as a garment doth hide the spiritual nakedness, and decks and adorns the soul with spiritual beauty&#8221; (<i>Cruden&#8217;s Concordance</i>). The work of women in this world is beautiful: we are the nurturers, the care-givers, the ones who bind the wounds and bear the children and make the home a place of refuge. Let&#8217;s pray for ourselves and for each other that as godly women we may not mar our &#8220;message that no one else can deliver just as we can,&#8221; and by so doing show the world the true beauty of a woman&#8217;s place.</p>

<h2>From the Old Life to the New</h2>
<p><i>The Salvation Testimony of Abigail Spinks</i></p>

<p>I want to give my salvation testimony to the benefit and encouragement of others and may all the glory go to my gracious Redeemer.</p>

<p>In May of &#8217;94 we took in two girls, Missy and Jenny (then 12 and 8, respectively). Our family has long been baby-sitting many children, but this was our first experience at having children in our home day and night, and basically part of our family. I was nine at the time, and Coquetta was soon to be thirteen. We had always jealously guarded our time as a family, for our whole days were filled with other children, except for weekends, of course.</p>

<p>One of the parents whose girl we baby-sat took in Missy and Jenny for one year before we did, and as we baby-sat their daughter, we would also watch them. Then the time came when these folks decided they had had enough and could no longer take care of Missy and Jenny (whose parents were in jail for dealing with drugs), and they asked us if we would. So, after much prayer, Mommy and Daddy agreed that they would take them.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t remember much about this time, but I do know that I was angry at my parents for their decision. Missy and Jenny were starved for love, Jenny especially, and were very needy children. I didn&#8217;t have the love of the Lord in my heart, and had no love for them whatsoever. I&#8217;m sure my parents knew how I felt, even though I tried my best to cover my feelings. I had not given my heart to Jesus and the load of having Missy and Jenny here stripped me of all my best veneer; I got angry, lost my temper, and Jenny and I fought almost all the time. It truly was a difficult time, as I&#8217;m sure my parents would tell you. If ever I needed a shelter in which to hide it was then, because everything bad I expected to happen came to pass and more. I was horribly unhappy, not the least reason being was that the Lord was dealing with me all those long summer months. I would not yield. I was full of pride and considered myself to be on a higher level than Missy and Jenny as the Lord had graciously placed me in a Christian home, even though repeatedly I saw how ugly I, in myself, really was. That pride kept me going. Of course there were times I selfishly enjoyed myself, but my life was void of anything of worth, much less being happy.</p>

<p>Well, things progressed over the summer. School started. We were not allowed to home school them as we&#8217;d hoped, so they returned to public school. Missy couldn&#8217;t stand the pressures there and, to shorten a very long story, ran away. She was brought back two hours later, but her mother, who sided with her, wanted them placed in different hands.</p>

<p>So two days later came the night I will never forget. Our home had settled into a strained atmosphere. It was late at night. I could not sleep and as I tossed and turned on my bed, I could see the light in Missy&#8217;s room, where she was packing her things. Missy had been closer to me than Jenny, and her running away had been hard on me. I couldn&#8217;t understand why she ran away, and yet I could. It had been because of anger, because of peer pressure, because she didn&#8217;t have a Savior to fill her with peace through the trying days we were all experiencing. Suddenly I saw myself in that situation, as no better than she who came from a broken home where wickedness and evil reigned. I saw for the first time how coming from a Christian home did not insure that I would not end up just like her and her people. I couldn&#8217;t keep back the tears as I told the Lord that I didn&#8217;t want to end up running away from home and ruining my life&#8212;I could see clearly by the choice she had so recently made that she was making a step downward into the awful darkness of the world. I desperately wanted the peace in my life that I saw evidenced in my parents lives as they had been pummeled on every side&#8230;. I wanted something better than I had had all summer long. And as I prayed, the Lord came down and He gave me what I so longed for and needed. He gave me an indescribable peace and a love for everyone. I felt as one of our songs says, &#8220;Stepped from the old life to the new.&#8221;<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/Tell_What_Hes_Done_For_You/index.html" title="Tell What He's Done For You">*</a></p>

<p>Truly then I began a different life. I couldn&#8217;t contain the joy in my heart, so I jumped out of bed and ran into Missy&#8217;s room. I remember the look of heartache on her young face, the sadness there, and then the amazement as she looked at me. I remember crying, &#8220;Oh, Missy the Lord has saved me!&#8221;</p>

<p>And she looked at me and said, &#8220;Oh, I wish I could be, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>I replied, &#8220;Oh, you can, you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she simply said, &#8220;No, I&#8217;ve gone too far.&#8221;</p>

<p>I pleaded with her, but to no avail. And finally returned to my room, a saved person, a newborn daughter of the King. Since then there has been trials&#8212;many trials&#8212;as there always is and will be, but my Father has been with me, patient and ever ready to help and give and give and give more grace, more faith, more strength, more love, as I need it. I&#8217;m so thankful for His mercy and His persistence in dealing with me.</p>

<p>I still continue to pray for the salvation of my dear, foster sisters. They are both out in the world now and lost in sin, but I know there is power in prayer and I want to keep praying for them! I so appreciate the people that kept praying for me, as I manifested a strong resistance all summer to that which was holy and pure, so much under conviction was I. I believe it was because of their prayers that the Lord continued to deal and deal and deal and tarry long with me&#8230;&#8203;the Lord hears the prayers of His dear children.</p>

<p>One of the verses of one of my favorite songs is:</p>

<p class="verse">My Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine;<br />For Thee all the follies of sin I resign;<br />My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art Thou;<br />If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, &#8217;tis now.<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/My_Jesus_I_Love_Thee/index.html" title="My Jesus, I Love Thee">*</a></p>

<p>If you are happening to read this and have not the love and grace and peace of the Lord burning in your heart, I would plead with you to let go of your pride and all that is keeping you from having peace with God. Nothing is worth not being able to say, &#8220;It is all right between Jesus and me.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">I&#8217;ve found my Lord and He is mine,<br />He won me by His love;<br />I&#8217;ll serve Him all my years of time,<br />And dwell with Him above.</p>

<p class="verse">No other Lord but Christ I know,<br />I walk with Him alone;<br />His streams of love forever flow,<br />Within my heart His throne.</p>

<p class="verse">He&#8217;s dearer to my heart than life,<br />He found me lost in sin;<br />He calmed the sea of inward strife,<br />And bade me come to Him.</p>

<p class="verse">My flesh recoiled before the cross,<br />And Satan whispered there,<br />&#8220;Thy gain will not repay the loss,<br />His yoke is hard to bear.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">I&#8217;ve tried the road of sin and found,<br />Its prospects all deceive;<br />I&#8217;ve proved the Lord, and joys abound,<br />More than I could believe.</p>

<p class="verse refrain_line">Refrain:</p><p class="verse refrain">His yoke is easy, His burden is light,<br />I&#8217;ve found it so, I&#8217;ve found it so;<br />His service is my sweetest delight,<br />His blessings ever flow.<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/His_Yoke_Is_Easy/index.html" title="His Yoke Is Easy">*</a></p>

<h2>Marvelously Healed</h2>
<p><i>Reprinted From a 1942 Tract</i></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Bless the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+103%3A1-3" title="Psalm 103:1-3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 103:1-3)</span></a></span></p>

<p>His benefits to me have been wonderful. He has always been so good to me. My mother was a Christian and lived to what light she had, so always taught us children to pray. The dear Lord began to strive with my heart when I was about 9 years old, and I went to the altar to seek the Lord, but my father thought me too young to seek the Lord, so wouldn&#8217;t let me go back to meeting; but the dear Lord continued to knock at my heart. At about 13 years of age, I was out in a field under a pecan tree praying for my father. He had the drink habit and I was almost always praying for him. Then the dear Lord sent conviction on me for my salvation. I cried out to my God, and He heard and answered, bless His dear name! Yes, He took every stain of sin away and satisfied my longing soul. I went to the house shouting praise to God and telling my mother I was saved. But my father said I was not, for I had not been baptized. This bothered me, for I wasn&#8217;t where I could be baptized just then; but as soon as I could, I went and joined the Christian Church so I could be baptized.</p>

<p>The preacher gave me a Testament. Thank God for that Testament! It was a little red-backed Testament. Oh, how I did love it. I had received many presents before this, but never such a wonderful present as that. I said I surely was going to read it through, so I began to study the precious little book; and what wonders I found in it!</p>

<p>I was very sickly, had never been strong. I had always had bad stomach trouble and spinal trouble and by that time had very bad heart trouble and a complication of diseases setting in. In this dear little book I read that Jesus healed when on earth, and read in James what to do when sick. Dear reader, turn to the <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+5">5th chapter of James</a> and you can read it, too. I read where Jesus washed his disciples&#8217; feet and said we ought to wash one another&#8217;s feet. I asked the preacher why we didn&#8217;t wash feet. I wanted them to come and pray for my healing, but of course they didn&#8217;t believe in that part of God&#8217;s Word.</p>

<p>But I would read it again and again. It was God&#8217;s Word, and I must believe it, even if the preacher didn&#8217;t. Oh, how can I ever praise the dear Lord enough, as I lay sick for four years, for talking to my heart and teaching me as I read the precious treasure, the little, red Testament that He had given me through someone who did not believe it all himself. He opened the scriptures to me. Oh, how good and precious He was to me. How constantly He stayed with me, how many dreams and visions He sent he, because He knew I had no one else to teach me.</p>

<p>One disease after another set up on my already frail body. I had spinal trouble, rheumatism, heart trouble, female trouble, and such awful nervous trouble. The blood would rush to my head and I would be unconscious for several days at a time. I was suffering almost everything at the hands of doctors, different surgical treatments, and bad medicine; yet through it all, everyone that saw me said I was the most patient sufferer they ever saw, and almost every time I was conscious I would call children around my bed and read the precious little book to them and talk to them about the goodness of God.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_8/tell_flower.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="311" /></div>
<p>Oh, dear readers, it wasn&#8217;t in my own strength I had this patience and courage, it was because I was hid away in Jesus. Oh, what a friend He proved to me! What if I had not found Him? Oh, what would I have done without Him? But He had found me, a little sick girl, and He was caring for me until He could teach me to fully trust Him, so He could heal me. I kept the precious little book under my pillow and read it as long as I could use my hands to hold it. I read in the dear Book where we should not wear gold or pearls (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+3%3A3">I&nbsp;Peter 3:3</a>), so I took off my rings. Anything I read in God&#8217;s Word I measured up to.</p>

<p>I read that we should be holy, so I sought the Lord for a holy life, and He sanctified my nature. Remember, dear reader, I had never heard any of this preached, but I read it in God&#8217;s Word, and was glad to measure to God&#8217;s Word. The trouble with so many people, instead of measuring to God&#8217;s Word they are trying to turn it around to suit themselves. We read, <span class="scripture">&#8220;And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+3%3A22" title="I&nbsp;John 3:22"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 3:22)</span></a></span></p>

<p>My parents spent all they had and all they could make for doctors, but I got no better, but worse and worse. Twenty-two doctors, in all, gave me up. But, thank God, while my body was getting worse and wasting away, I was learning more, and my dependence was on God. Finally, paralysis of the muscles and nerves set in. I lost use of myself; also control of most all the organs of my body, and was in this condition about eleven months. I could slide my right hand and roll my head on the pillow, and that is all the use I had of myself. The doctors all quit. I could stand no more treatments nor bad medicine. Just the scent of it would cause me to faint away. I was cold all the time from my breast down, and wrapped in woolen blankets all the time, winter and summer; and fanned in the face most of the time, day and night, to help me get my breath. I smothered all the time, and would sink away, and they would have to shake me and call me. I would struggle for my breath and still live.</p>

<p>At last a few months before I was healed I gave my little Testament away. I told my mother one day that before I died I wanted to give it to someone and pray for it to do them some good as it had me. So I soon gave it away, for I thought I was going. Thank God, I was ready to go, but the dear Lord had it planned otherwise. It would have been sweet to have gone home to Jesus then, but it will be better still to stay and take a few others with me when I go. Dear reader, if you are not saved, won&#8217;t you give Jesus your heart and go with me to heaven?</p>

<p>The last place my parents took me was to Dallas, Texas. The last two weeks I lived in this condition, I was so low I could not be allowed to sleep more than a minute or two at a time, or I would quit breathing, for I had to struggle for every breath. The folks would shake and call me, telling me to get my breath and I would begin to struggle for breath again. But praise our God, on the 28th night of April, 1902, the dear Lord let me sleep, my folks said about an hour, and He sent me a dream. I dreamed I was in a large building which was on fire, and Jesus helped me out and said, &#8220;Essie, whatever you trust me in, I will help you, now and forever.&#8221; When I awoke the first thing I thought of was of what Jesus had said, and I thought, &#8220;Now I am going to trust him to make me walk.&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t tell anyone, for sometimes I could whisper and sometimes I couldn&#8217;t; but I don&#8217;t think I could at this time, so I just prayed a very short prayer. About all I said was, &#8220;Jesus, You said whatever I would trust You in, You would help me now and forever. Now, Lord, I am going to trust You to make me walk.&#8221; I mentioned just a few of His promises in the Bible and that was all, but I knew when I said Amen, I was well.</p>

<p>My sister was sitting by me just then, for I was never left alone a minute. I said out loud, &#8220;Dolly, tell Mama to come here.&#8221; Mama was on the porch just outside my room. So she went and said. &#8220;Mama, Essie called for you out loud.&#8221; This excited her. She came and I said, &#8220;Mama stand at the foot of my bed, I want to tell you my dream. She stood there and I told it to her, &#8220;and, Mama, I prayed and Jesus has healed me, and I can get up and walk.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Honey, do you want Mama to try to raise you up?&#8221;</p>

<p>I said, &#8220;Mama, you can&#8217;t raise me up. And she couldn&#8217;t, for one couldn&#8217;t bend my back to raise me up, but I said, &#8220;God can raise me up. But I want you to go tell the neighbors. I want to show you all what God has done.&#8221; So she ran out telling the near neighbors how I was talking. One began to tell another, and the house was soon almost full.</p>

<p>My mother and most of the others thought I was dying, and the Lord was just giving me marvelous strength in my dying hour because I was living so close to Him. Most wanted to come to my bed, saying, &#8220;Do you want me to try and raise you up?&#8221; I would answer, &#8220;No, you can&#8217;t raise me up, but God can. Don&#8217;t come to me. God has healed me and God will get the praise. I don&#8217;t want a human hand laid on me. There are here Christian Scientists, Magnetic healers, and others that would like to have the praise for this.&#8221; My mother would say, &#8220;Please let me come to you.&#8221; But I would answer, &#8220;No, Mama, I am coming to you this time. You have come to me long enough. Have everyone stand back and let me alone; and you stand right in that door and God will help me out of this bed and I will come to you.</p>

<p>So she got them all quieted and she stood in the door. I threw the cover off, jumped out of bed and ran to my mother. Praise our God. I had prayed to walk, but the Lord always does more than we think or ask. I ran, leaped, and shouted, went rejoicing up and down the steps to the house. It was about 8 o&#8217;clock in the morning when I was healed. I went to the table at noon and ate my dinner, lay down about two o&#8217;clock; the next morning I walked six or eight blocks to prayer meeting, which was the first meeting of any kind I had attended in two years. I&#8217;d been so poorly, some of my backbone and hip bones were cut through.</p>

<p>My father had left early in the morning before I was healed, as he had some important business away and was late getting back. When he came home, my bedding was all out and a large crowd of people was there, so he thought I was surely dead, as that was what was expected all the time. He sat down on the back porch and was weeping. Someone told my mother and she said, &#8220;He thinks Essie is dead.&#8221; So she went to him, but I followed her, not realizing what a shock it would be for him. I went up behind him and spoke to him. It almost excited him to death. He was a man of very strong nerve, but he cried, &#8220;Who is this?&#8221; When told it was I, his Essie, he cried &#8220;No, it can&#8217;t be, she is dead.&#8221; He was so stunned he could not believe it though looking me in the face. He searched the house for my corpse then came and sat down just facing me, and wanted to be told all about it; he would cry loudly, &#8220;I can&#8217;t stand that!&#8221; then again would say, &#8220;Tell about it.&#8221; This he did many times, each time stopping us again. At last he called my mother into another room, and she told him all about it.</p>

<p>Then he came back and asked me if I could sing, which I used to do so much for him, but had not for at least two years. I told him I could, and he said, &#8220;Sing &#8216;Diamonds in the Rough.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221; I sang it through. Then we all knelt, and I prayed. Then I would run out of doors and look at the beautiful stars, and praise God. Father would let me go as long as he could stand it, then call me and hold me as if afraid to turn me loose lest I should vanish and he could not keep me.</p>

<p>An hour or two after I was healed, someone phoned two doctors at Ft. Worth, 30 miles from Dallas, Texas. They had been over there a few weeks before and looked at me, but did not even come to my bed. They just looked at me and said they could not raise the dead. The one calling them over the phone said, &#8220;The sick girl prayed to walk and is up walking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; they answered, &#8220;impossible!&#8221; But they were assured it was true. They answered, &#8220;We will not believe it unless we see it.</p>

<p>The other answered, &#8220;Take the inter-urban and come and see for yourself.&#8221; So they did. When they saw me, they said, &#8220;Well, you really are the girl that was so sick?&#8221;</p>

<p>I answered, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; They asked me to tell them all about it, which I gladly did. They said it was truly God that did it and that it was wonderful. They asked me to pray, and they and all the rest again knelt in prayer and praise.</p>

<p>All who saw me were so shocked and felt so much the power of God they wanted me to call on God for them. The man that became my husband later, had never seen me walk before. He said he thought he was a Christian, but when he saw so much of the power of God, he felt like he was the meanest man in the world. He sat down and couldn&#8217;t speak for some time, and when he could, he asked me to pray for him. He is now my husband and a child of God, and often says that was the most wonderful healing he ever saw and that God used me to save his soui.</p>

<p>Many souls were saved and convinced of God&#8217;s power to heal, so I feel a thousand times repaid for my suffering. To God be all the glory.</p>

<p>He has healed me of different things many times since, and His promise that &#8220;He would help me now and forever,&#8221; He has proven true so many times. I am determined by his grace to spend all my life in His service. He is still just as dear to me as He was the 29th day of April, 1902. I was 18 years old the first day of April and healed the 29th day of the same month. My name was Essie Birmingham before I married.</p>

<p>Bless the Lord, O my soul. He is so good to me and to all those that love Him! I love Him with all my heart. He is my life, my strength, my all, my Savior, my healer, my keeper.</p>

<p>Praise our wonderful Savior.</p>

<h2>Redeemed by the Precious Blood of Christ</h2>
<p><i>The Salvation Testimony of Amy Zander</i></p>

<p>When I was five years old, a neighbor invited me to her church&#8217;s Vacation Bible School for children. My parents allowed me to go one day. I mostly remember the activities&#8212;games, singing, crafts, etc., but the teacher also shared a story about Jesus. When I got home that night, I had many questions, and I got up on my Daddy&#8217;s tummy (he was in bed) which was my favorite &#8220;sitting perch&#8221; when I was young, and asked many questions. Who was Jesus? Why did He die? Was I going to hell? My father knew just what to say, and that night, September 5, 1986, I accepted Jesus as my Savior. I knew that I was a sinner who needed a Savior, and I asked Jesus to come into my heart and save me, forgive me, and cleanse me from my sins, and make me His child. How thankful am for salvation, the blessed, free gift from God! Never have I regretted becoming a Christian (how could a Christian regret it?). My desire is to serve and please my Lord all my days.</p>

<p>Scripture about salvation is very dear to me, and one of my favorite, special verses is <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+1%3A18-19">I&nbsp;Peter 1:18-19</a>, which says, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.&#8221;</span></p>

<h1>Conviction of Sin</h1>

<p class="author">Jennie C. Rutty</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Girls:</p>

<p>Those of you who have been in the company of religious people have often heard this word used; but perhaps some have never stopped to think what it means. If a man has committed an offense against the laws of our state or country, the evidence is given against him and he is judged guilty, or <i>convicted</i> of a misdemeanor. When the word of God is read or preached it reveals to us what the standard or law of right is, and as we apply it to ourselves, we see that in many ways and very many times we have transgressed the law of God and stand before Him guilty&#8212;<i>convicted</i> of wrong-doing, or sin; for all that is wrong is sin.</p>

<p>If we heed this conviction, let it rest upon our hearts and minds, our wrong-doing will be a very heavy burden, and we become very anxious to have it removed. There are two ways to gain relief. One is a very unwise and wicked way, and the other is a wise and joyous way. Some grieve God by resisting and turning from this conviction to deeper earthly joys and pleasures, thus often drowning it in worldly gaiety. But it will arise again and again, and often in the height of frivolous amusement they can realize the displeasure of God&#8212;convicted of sin. The other way is to obey the scriptures, seek God for the pardon of past transgressions, sincerely repenting of and forsaking them, so they are blotted out of the book of remembrance, and through the merits of Jesus&#8217; death, they do not longer stand against us.</p>

<p>It is blessed to be reconciled to God through the Son. Some have been under deep conviction at different times and have turned from it, and they feel very indifferent about their salvation. Every one who knows she ought to serve God, knows it is wisdom, should seek God for conviction of sin, by prayer and by reading His word.</p>

<p>A sister who was an invalid during her youth was peevish and easily teased by her fun-loving brothers, which made her very angry, and many quarrels and disagreements arose, making home very unpleasant.</p>

<p>Once in a mild rebuke, her mother said, &#8220;My child, will you never stop this quarreling until I am laid away in the grave?&#8221; It weighed heavily upon her, and, as she walked in the yard, a strong desire filled her heart to have salvation; because that would make her kind to her mother the rest of her days. So she knelt and asked God to show her how sinful she was; to give her a deep conviction of sin. And He answered her prayer immediately, making her to realize the exceeding sinfulness of sin. Then she felt she was the chief of sinners and it would not be strange if the earth would open and swallow her up to hide her from an offended God, against whom she had sinned times without number. She continued to pray and yield herself to God until He pardoned her transgressions for Jesus&#8217; sake, and made her a new creature.</p>

<p>Some are waiting for something to happen to them to make them very anxious to get saved, but every time you read the word of God or hear it preached He is speaking to you, asking for your love and service; and you have no assurance that something wonderful will transpire to bring you to a decision to serve Him. Others want to be arrested by the Spirit and fall before the Lord, as Saul on his way to Damascus. There were numbers saved at that time, yet there is no record of any more such wonderful manifestations of the Spirit; but many inquired, <span class="scripture">&#8220;What shall we do [to be saved]?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Acts+2%3A37" title="Acts 2:37"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Acts 2:37)</span></a></span> and they were told to repent, believe, and be baptized. While God uses very many ways to help us yield our wills to Him, it would be too bad to wait for sickness, or death of our loved ones, or for some fearful accident to make us serious or to concern us about the welfare of our precious souls. As we look back upon our lives we see many things which we believe were permitted, to bring us where we could hear the pure gospel preached and where we could yield ourselves to God. If we had not been so hard to hear, heed, and understand the things that concerned our welfare, we had not needed to pass through some of these severe trials and circumstances.</p>

<p>I think perhaps my own experience might help someone, so I will give it to you. About a year after I asked God to give me again a tender heart, while at school, I attended a meeting where every possible persuasion was used to induce the young to understand they ought to serve God; but this did not bring conviction of sin. I did not know how bound I was by the fetters of sin, and that of myself I could not serve God acceptably; but I obeyed the instruction given, and said I would serve Him (in my own way), and then they said that I should believe that as I came to God, He would not cast me away but would receive me.</p>

<p>This was done with the head, or intellectual faith, but as I was not convicted of sin, there could not be the heart faith that is necessary for the real conversion of the soul.</p>

<p>So I thought as God was so good I would please Him by being good. Then the real conflict began. I would see one fault in myself and give special attention to try to get the victory over it: when pretty well satisfied on that line, other faults would receive notice and I would battle a while on that line, trying to subdue my enemies; but while my attention was directed to them, behold, the first fault would arise and gain a victory.</p>

<p>Thus while I fought, on every side was defeat. Often discouragement would prevail, and as others seemed to take things easy, I would too, until, aroused again to think that some day I ought to get so good as never to do anything I knew to be wrong, I would begin again to battle against sin. Oh, how miserable was my life! The only joy there was in it was in thinking that some time I would gain heaven, if I &#8220;fought to win the prize.&#8221; While I read the Bible some and prayed, it was not a pleasure, but a duty.</p>

<p>After nine years of this life, through many changes, the opportunity came to hear the Word preached more perfectly. Consecration was more carefully taught, and that everything that the Bible condemns was to be given up, and then God would make such a change in the heart that no desire would arise to do those things. That seemed so blessed after such a weary struggle, that I was very anxious to obtain it. So one thing after another was given up until finally a sweet peace rested upon me and there was such a change in my heart, because the old sins had passed away. About a month afterward I looked back and rejoiced that my controlling sins were vanquished enemies; for I did not yield to them any more, through the change wrought by God in my heart.</p>

<p>Now, dear girls, you see from that nine years&#8217; experience in conflict with sin, that I saw how awful it was and fully believed that only divine power could set me free. Do you realize that all that are not saved are thus bound by the fetters of sin, and so are servants of sin? Are you willing to have those fetters broken? Do you know that if you ask God to help you to be willing and to decide for the right, He will do so? Oh, how intense is the desire within my heart that these letters may help you to be wise in seeking first the kingdom of God and His righteousness!</p>

<p>Those of you who are not converted, but who think you are not doing wrong, please read what the Bible says about the works of the flesh, in <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+5%3A19-26%3B+Ephesians+5%3A1-8%3B+and+Colossians+3%3A5-18">Galatians 5:19-26; Ephesians 5:1-8; and Colossians 3:5-18</a>. Now, they who do just as they please to do are walking after the flesh and are called to repentance, or they shall perish. Oh, dear girls, we cannot be righteous without the pure religion of the Bible, which is termed salvation, which means deliverance from sin.</p>

<h1>Supporting Grace</h1>

<p class="author">Alfred Cookman</p>

<p>Let no one think for a moment that because God has answered his prayers, and granted him a deeper work of grace, that therefore he may hope for an exemption from trials, temptations, and afflictions. These will come. But we are <span class="scripture">&#8220;looking unto Jesus&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A2" title="Hebrews 12:2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 12:2)</span></a></span>; they will not move us off the Rock; and that is the important matter. In the time of conflict and darkness, be concerned about two things. First, is my consecration entire? Yes. Second, do I this moment accept and trust in Jesus as my perfect Savior? Yes. Then &#8220;All is well.&#8221; I am on the Rock. The Rock may be in the valley or the hilltop&#8212;in the cloud or in the sunshine&#8212;it matters not, if we are on that sure foundation. All is well. It is not darkness, temptation, or trial that separates the soul from God&#8212;it is only sin. Let then our trusting souls adopt as their motto, &#8220;Anything but sin.&#8221; Anywhere with Jesus.</p>

<h1>Count it All Joy</h1>

<p class="author">Skye Erickson</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;My [sisters] count it <i>all</i> joy, when you fall into divers temptations; Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+1%3A2-3" title="James 1:2-3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 1:2-3)</span></a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sisters,</p>

<p>Do you ever find it hard to count it <i>all</i> joy? When in the midst of flurry, your little sibling is clinging to your leg while you&#8217;re rushing to save the toast from burning&#8230;&#8203;only to miss it by a few seconds? Or maybe your mother is sick and you have the house to keep up; baby&#8217;s got a wet diaper, the phone is ringing, and your mother is waiting for her soup. Or perhaps you mentioned something to the family&#8212;something you didn&#8217;t want shared with others outside the family circle just yet&#8230;&#8203;but, oops, someone leaked it out.</p>

<p>I am sure we have all been in similar situations and/or under trying circumstances. And I am sure we have all, one time or another, felt discouraged or overwhelmed or frustrated, or maybe all three. During crazy times like that (and they happen just about weekly!) it is sometimes hard to remember to count it all joy; I often feel like running to a quiet place and crying out my frustration. It is certainly easier to be joyful and content in the Lord when life is going easily, but what about during the harder times? James, by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, told us to count it all&#8212;especially the trying times&#8212;joy.</p>

<p>One day, just recently, my heart grew sore with temptation and I was frustrated and hurt by another&#8217;s action. The devil was strongly tempting me to hold a grudge; the Lord on the other hand, was urging me to remember His Word and count it all joy. After praying for some time to take away any bad feelings I might&#8217;ve had, He gave me a song and inspired my heart. May I share it with you?</p>

<p class="verse">Cast thy cares upon the Savior,<br />He will bear them all for thee;<br />And thy soul which now is burdened,<br />Shall be kept forever free.</p>

<p class="verse refrain_line">Refrain:</p><p class="verse refrain">Cast thy cares upon the Savior,<br />He will gladly bear them all;<br />Even though they seem like mountains,<br />Even though they may be small.</p>

<p>I am certainly a novice when it comes to rejoicing in the midst of trials, but by God&#8217;s help and leading, I&#8217;d like to share with you some insights that helped me to count it all joy.</p>

<h2>Quiet Your Heart</h2>
<p class="verse">Cast thy cares upon the Savior,<br />He will bear them all for thee;<br />And thy soul which now is burdened,<br />Shall be kept forever free.</p>

<p>Probably the greatest action we could make when we&#8217;re frustrated and weary, is to cast our cares upon the gentle breast of our Heavenly Father, <span class="scripture">&#8220;for he careth for you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+5%3A7" title="I&nbsp;Peter 5:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 5:7)</span></a></span> When you are sorely tried and in need of grace, take a little time apart to quiet your heart before the Lord and tune into His Heavenly grace and peace. By doing so, we can give to Him all the things that disturb us, frustrate us, make us sad&#8212;in turn, receive peace and strength to press on.</p>

<h2>As Hollow Channels</h2>
<p class="verse">Put your trust alone in Jesus,<br />Trusting not in human arm;<br />And if cast within the furnace,<br />He will keep thee from all harm.</p>

<p>Put your trust <i>alone</i> in Jesus. When we trust in ourselves, in our strength, we will fail in counting it all joy. Why? We are nothing, and our strength is weak; we have little means of getting on by ourselves. We were created to be dependent on the Lord and He is One we can lean on&#8212;who has great storehouses of grace and strength. If we open ourselves to Him, make ourselves as hollow channels for Him to fill and work through, He will try us in the fire till we come forth, like Job, as gold.</p>

<h2>Standing on His Promises</h2>
<p class="verse">Live the life the word demands you,<br />Then the foe you need not fear;<br />For while standing on the promise,<br />Jesus Christ is always near.</p>

<p>What are some of His promises to us?</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=James+1%3A12" title="James 1:12"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (James 1:12)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;But they that wait upon the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Isaiah+40%3A31" title="Isaiah 40:31"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Isaiah 40:31)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelations+2%3A26" title="Revelations 2:26"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelations 2:26)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Revelations+21%3A7" title="Revelations 21:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Revelations 21:7)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Peter+1%3A7" title="I&nbsp;Peter 1:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Peter 1:7)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Corinthians+10%3A13" title="I&nbsp;Corinthians 10:13"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Corinthians 10:13)</span></a></span></p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+12%3A9" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 12:9"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 12:9)</span></a></span></p>

<h2>The Great Cloud of Witnesses</h2>
<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses&#8230;.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+12%3A1" title="Hebrews 12:1"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 12:1)</span></a></span></p>

<p>A dear friend of mine once mentioned to me that she sometimes felt like she was the only one out there struggling. Sound familiar? I, too, must admit that I have struggled with the same feeling. It is natural because we&#8217;re not all together and we can&#8217;t see each other struggling with the very same things. But I am greatly encouraged when I read about our &#8220;great cloud of witnesses.&#8221; There are countless others who have gone on before us, bearing their crosses and rejoicing in the Lord. As I already quoted, He will not give us more than we can bear and <span class="scripture">&#8220;we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+4%3A15" title="Hebrews 4:15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Hebrews 4:15)</span></a></span></p>

<p>It is a wonderful comfort to know that Jesus feels and has experienced the same burdens and cares and trials and weariness. He also knows our weak areas and ways that we re drawn to. Knowing this, counting our trials all joy will become easier and easier as our trust ascends unto higher places and our confidence grows deeper in Him.</p>

<h2>Sing a Song</h2>
<p>Have you ever tried singing a song when you&#8217;re tired and frustrated? What was the result? Many a time, when my heart was upset and not at peace, the Lord would bring a song to my heart and it would &#8220;calm the waves.&#8221;</p>

<p>When you feel yourself becoming frustrated or growing annoyed, start singing a song, <b>even if you don&#8217;t feel like it</b>! I can testify from experience that the joy and love that are entwined in the song will pop out at you and the Lord will invariably use it to nourish you and give you the little extra push to keep climbing upward.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+119%3A73" title="Psalm 119:73"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 119:73)</span></a></span></p>

<p>Oh, Lord, give us understanding and grace that we may learn to trust You through our trials that You see fit to send our way&#8212;that we may learn to count them all joy and glorify You through them.</p>

<p>What you see depends on which way you look. Looking around on life&#8217;s circumstances, you will miss seeing the better things of life. Erect for your soul a spiritual observatory where you can look into the heavens and see some of its wonder. You do not need to wait until you get to heaven to behold some of its glories. Heaven will come down to you with many of its blessed realities. Soul vision of God is necessary to soul likeness to God. The beauty of the Lord is inwrought into the soul as it gazes, with steadfast eye, upon Him. The soul attaches itself to and becomes like that upon which it gazes. Those who see most of God are fullest of Him. There are some rare souls who see everything full of Him. Every bush is aflame with His presence. They see Him in every event in life. There are no happenings so small as to disclose none of His beauty. They see His love in all the provocations and interruptions. They welcome every annoyance, grievance, and trial because they see His hand of love in everything. When the soul grasps the fact that nothing can come to us without His permission, then we have found heaven on earth.</p>

<h1>Wait</h1>

<p class="author">Author Unknown; submitted by Holly Hageman</p>

<p class="verse">Desperately, helplessly, longingly, I cried:<br />Quietly, patiently, lovingly God replied.<br />I pled and I wept for a clue to my fate,<br />And the Master who gently said, &#8220;Child, you must wait.&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Wait? You say, wait!&#8221; my indignant reply.<br />&#8220;Lord, I need answers, I need to know why!<br />Is Your hand shortened? Or have You not heard?<br />By Faith, I have asked, and am claiming Your Word.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;My future and all to which I can relate<br />Hangs in the balance, and YOU tell me to WAIT?<br />I&#8217;m needing a &#8216;yes,&#8217; a go-ahead sign,<br />Or even a &#8216;no,&#8217; to which I can resign.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;And Lord, You promised that if we believe,<br />We need but to ask, and we shall receive.<br />Lord, I&#8217;ve been asking, and this is my cry:<br />I&#8217;m weary of asking! I need a reply!&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">Then quietly, softly, I learned of my fate<br />As my Master replied once again, &#8220;You must wait.&#8221;<br />So, I slumped in my chair, defeated and taut<br />And grumbled to God, &#8220;So, I&#8217;m waiting&#8230;&#8203;for what?&#8221;</p>

<p class="verse">He seemed, then, to kneel, and His eyes wept with mine,<br />And He tenderly said, &#8220;I could give you a sign.<br />I could shake the heavens, and darken the sun.<br />I could raise the dead, and cause mountains to run.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;All you seek I could give, and pleased you would be.<br />You would have what you want&#8212;but, you wouldn&#8217;t know Me.<br />You&#8217;d not know the depth of My love for each saint;<br />You&#8217;d not know the power that I give to the faint.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_8/wait_flower.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="342" /></div>
<p class="verse">&#8220;You&#8217;d not learn to see through the clouds of despair;<br />You&#8217;d not learn to trust just by knowing I&#8217;m there;<br />You&#8217;d not know the joy of resting in Me<br />When darkness and silence were all you could see.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;You&#8217;d never experience that fullness of love<br />As the peace of My Spirit descends like a dove;<br />You&#8217;d know that I live and I save&#8230;&#8203;(for a start),<br />But you&#8217;d not know the depth of the beat of My heart.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;The glow of My comfort late into the night.<br />The faith that I give when you walk without sight.<br />The depth that&#8217;s beyond getting just what you asked<br />Of an infinite God, who makes what you have LAST.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;You&#8217;d never know, should your pain quickly flee,<br />What it means that &#8216;My grace is sufficient for Thee.&#8217;<br />Yes, your dreams for your loved one overnight would come true.<br />But, oh, the loss! If I lost what I&#8217;m doing in you!</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;So, be silent, my child, and in time you will see<br />That the greatest of gifts is to get to know Me.<br />And though oft may My answers seem terribly late,<br />My most precious answer of all is still, &#8216;WAIT.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221;</p>

<h1>Learning to Wait</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear Girls,</p>

<p>Just thought I would share my devotions and thoughts with you this morning. I was reading in <i>The Hidden Life</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first"><span class="scripture">&#8220;Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Colossians+3%3A3" title="Colossians 3:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Colossians 3:3)</span></a></span> As the solemn chimes of the village curfew bell reverberate among the hills, announcing to all the close of another day and the bringing in of another night; so from out of this text comes pealing the deep and sacred sound, &#8220;Death&#8212;life; death&#8212;life,&#8221; which, reverberating along the corridors of time, announces to every Christian heart the close of a life of sin and the beginning of a life with God. Here is a mystery, O ye saints. Ye are both dead and alive. This inspired writer in another place says,  <span class="scripture">&#8220;She that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+Timothy+5%3A6" title="I&nbsp;Timothy 5:6"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;Timothy 5:6)</span></a></span></p>

<p class="citation"><span>[Orr, Charles E.; <a href="../../../texts/The_Hidden_Life/index.html"><i>The Hidden Life</i></a>, &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/The_Hidden_Life/The_Hidden_Life/index.html">The Hidden Life</a>&#8221;]</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>I thank the Lord that He came to this earth as a babe, endured the physical strains of this earthly life, and then did the ultimate&#8212;died on the cross, that we can have this hidden well-spring of living water in our hearts today.</p>

<p>The Christian life is such a blessed life in comparison to the sinner&#8217;s life! The devil paints the world&#8217;s ways as so bright and gay, oh, so attractive to the flesh, but oh, so deceptive. Truly the scripture is true, <span class="scripture">&#8220;The wages of sin is death.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+6%3A23" title="Romans 6:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 6:23)</span></a></span> In a recent conversation with my parents, I learned that a cousin three years older than myself whom I grew up with has been living with a man (2nd marriage) who has been verbally abusive to her. He has now left her and filed for divorce. She was a very beautiful girl. We went to Sunday school together. We visited in each others homes. We showed each other our hope chest things. She had a desire to live right, got saved, and we enjoyed each others company very much. She graduated from high school, got a job and an apartment. The world had such a strong pull. The devil knows how to tempt each of us in our weak areas. She lost out with God, started wearing make-up. She met a young man and they fell in love and were planning to be married. At that point an evangelist came to our congregation. The Lord dealt with her, and one night she asked me to go to the altar with her. Oh, the struggle was so hard! God was pulling on her heart; He saw the future and a life of heartache ahead, and wanted to spare her this misery. But you know what she said there at the altar? &#8220;I can&#8217;t give him up! I can&#8217;t give him up!&#8221; She knew it was against God&#8217;s word for saved persons to marry unsaved. After much prayer and counseling from the minister she professed to get saved. After service she opened up her purse and gave me all her make-up and asked me to burn it, which I promptly did the next day. But it proved to not be a heart-felt change. She went back and went ahead and married her fiance. Later <i>she</i> divorced him, and married another man. Her husband was very hurt and disappointed. He thought he had a good girl from a Christian home. I really believe he would have gotten saved too, if she would have yielded her whole heart and ways to God. Her vision was so limited. She felt he would not have her if she were living for God. But the Lord could have dealt with his heart, too.</p>

<p>Truly the Christian life <i>is</i> a hidden life. It&#8217;s joys are hidden from the world. If folks don&#8217;t seek, they don&#8217;t find the greater joys and pleasures of living for the Lord. My cousin has surely had a hard life and my heart goes out to her. In my youth I prayed for God to stretch out His mercy to her. My burden to pray has been renewed since hearing her latest situation. When God can&#8217;t get ahold of individual hearts when they are young to spare them heartache, then it seems that after the ways of the world prove out miserable and wretched that they can see the Lord&#8217;s ways are <b>so much better</b>.</p>

<p>I have just been thanking the Lord for helping me to choose Him completely in my youth and wait on the Lord for a companion. <b>It surely pays</b>! I was 29 before I married and the wait seemed <i>so</i> long then, but now it seems like nothing! I am <i>so</i> glad I waited on God. The girls I went to Sunday school with got married. Even my own sister, who was four years younger than I, got married. It just seemed I was going to be left out. But God knew what was best for me. Since I have been married, I know the waiting was important. The Lord taught me a lot about waiting during my single days.</p>

<p>It seems you&#8217;re doing nothing. But one day God communicated to me that waiting was just what He wanted me to do!</p>

<p>Thank the Lord. I was in His will&#8212;doing just what He had planned for me! Have you heard this song? We trust it will be a blessing to you.</p>

<p class="verse">The service of Jesus true pleasure affords,<br />In Him there is joy without an alloy;<br />&#8217;Tis Heaven to trust Him and rest on His words;<br />It pays to serve Jesus each day.</p>

<p class="verse">It pays to serve Jesus whate&#8217;er may betide,<br />It pays to be true whate&#8217;er you may do;<br />&#8217;Tis riches of mercy in Him to abide;<br />It pays to serve Jesus each day.</p>

<p class="verse">Though sometimes the shadows may hang o&#8217;er the way,<br />And sorrows may come to beckon us home,<br />Our precious Redeemer each toil will repay;<br />It pays to serve Jesus each day.</p>

<p class="verse refrain_line">Refrain:</p><p class="verse refrain">It pays to serve Jesus, it pays every day,<br />It pays every step of the way,<br />Though the pathway to glory may sometimes be drear,<br />You&#8217;ll be happy each step of the way.<a class="lib_ref" href="../../../music/It_Pays_to_Serve_Jesus/index.html" title="It Pays to Serve Jesus">*</a></p>

<p>Be encouraged, dear girls, God has a plan for you. Keep close to Him.</p>

<p class="signature">With Christian love,<br />Sister Elois Spinks</p>

<h2>Stitches &#8217;N&#8217; Stories for Little Sisters<br />(And Not So Little Ones!)</h2>
<h1>Daniel and the Lace</h1>

<h2 class="subtitle">or, A Perfectly Horrible Brother</h2>
<p class="author">Ksanndra Hauffer</p>

<p>&#8220;Daniel!&#8221; The lithe figure of a young girl sped around the corner of the barn, over the gate, and into the garden. &#8220;Daniel!&#8221; she said as she reached the garden and grabbed her older brother by the arm, &#8220;Give me that lace immediately. Now.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Daniel only grinned slowly and lazily, as he replied, &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t want it now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do, too,&#8221; the girl returned, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care how dirty you got it. It&#8217;s still lace and it still took me many hours to make and I need it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel, who from all appearances was deaf, leaned on the garden gate, took out his pocket knife, and began to widdle one of the posts marking the carrots that were planted there. &#8220;It would cause you pain to see it, Susie, and I don&#8217;t really want to do that, so I guess I&#8217;ll just keep it for now.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know I don&#8217;t like to be called Susie; my name is <i>Susanna</i>, and I do want my lace! Give it to me! Now! I need it!&#8221; she flashed back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who needs lace anyway?&#8221; Daniel asked the sky, meditatively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daniel, give back whatever you&#8217;ve taken from your sister right now.&#8221; Papa spoke from behind the children.</p>

<p>Susanna had been so intent on getting her lace back, and Daniel in keeping it, that neither had noticed their father standing behind them.</p>

<p>&#8220;And when you give it back, I could use your help in the barn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel reached slowly and carefully in his pocket and pulled out a snail, a few greasy bolts, then several tiny pieces of unrecognizably dirty lace.</p>

<p>Susanna stared in horror at the pieces. &#8220;That isn&#8217;t my lace, Dan,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;And you know it.&#8221; Tears filled her eyes. &#8220;I&#8217;m telling Mom. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do. You&#8217;ll be sorry, you perfectly awful brother!&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel watched her open the gate and start toward the house, before he spoke. &#8220;I <i>told</i> you that you wouldn&#8217;t want it.&#8221; And then he went whistling off to the barn.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Dear_Princess_8/stories_girl.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="283" /></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;.I&#8217;ve told it just like it happened, Mama,&#8221; Susanna finished her tale of woe. &#8220;And my lace is all cut up and it took so long make! I can&#8217;t use it for my pillowcase now. All because of my perfectly horrible brother!&#8221; And Susanna dissolved in tears in her mother&#8217;s lap.</p>

<p>Mrs. Meyer stroked her daughter&#8217;s dark hair soothingly. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, my dear, that your brother ruined your lace; that was very wrong of him. And I know you worked very hard on it. But there is something else you lost that I am even more concerned about. Do you know what that was?</p>

<p>Susanna propped herself up on one elbow and looked into her mother&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know I lost anything else,&#8221; She exclaimed in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you did, and it is vastly more important than a foot length of lace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You lost your temper, Susanna. You lost control of it; and that is something you must never do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh. But, but&#8230;&#8203;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, what Susanna?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mama he took my lace and <i>cut it up</i>. And it was my daintiest pattern too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear there are things that are more important than lace, don&#8217;t you agree? And one of those is holding your temper or keeping your peace. The sooner you learn to have complete control over your temper, the better off you will be. My dear remember, whatever happens to you in life, the peace must be kept. If it is not, you are just as wrong as the person who did the wrong to you.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Mama, I try, but Dan makes me so mad, I think he spends half the night thinking up mean things to do to me every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Susanna, that is just it, <i>you</i> try. I know you cannot do it in your own strength&#8212;it is impossible for me, either. But you are a daughter of the King of Kings, and He has promised to supply all your needs, including this one. If you will ask Him, He will give you the grace to have peace reign in your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish the Lord seemed as real to me, as He does to you, Mama&#8230;. I sometimes wonder if He is really there&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not doubt that He is there. If you doubt His existence, you will get nothing from Him. Yet, I know how easy it is to crowd Him out, especially when you are young, because He is not visibly at your side. What you must do is talk to Him constantly, tell Him everything. Read His Word as much as is possible and with God&#8217;s help, practice what you read. Ask God for help to unwind your heart of terrestrial things of this earth&#8212;like your lovely lace&#8212;and place your heart in another country&#8212;a heavenly one. It reminds me of a beautiful verse I once heard,</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;I want, by my aspect serene,<br />My actions and words to declare,<br />That my treasure is placed in a country unseen,<br />That my heart&#8217;s best affections are there.</p>

<p>&#8220;You, see my dear, now that you are a daughter of the King whose palace is in Heaven, this world, this present home is not really where you belong. Someday, when your body is laid to earth, your spirit will soar up to this home, your real home. For right now, you are just journeying there. Now let me ask you a question, dear; when you get home, to your Father, the King, and to His palace, will the foot of lace Danny tore up matter to you then?&#8221;</p>

<p>Susanna gazed silently at the pieces of dirty lace she held in her hand. Would these matter when she was in her Father&#8217;s mansion? &#8220;No,&#8221; Susanna replied, looking up into her mother&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, dear, it will not matter the least bit then. So I would encourage you not to lose your temper; for over there, nothing material in this life will matter. And also, Susanna, someday, most likely, someone will really hurt you and take a lot worse than a foot of lace. But if you learn now to go to your King for help and set your affections in His Kingdom, nothing, <i>nothing</i>, can ever hurt you.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mama,&#8221; Susanna said quietly, rising from her seat on the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are welcome, Susanna,&#8221; Mrs. Meyer replied, and she watched with loving eyes as her daughter picked up the family Bible and walked outside toward the chicken house, to the tree that had been her favorite place since childhood.</p>

<div class="blurb">
<p class="first">A note from the author: some persons may think this story is a very poor example of how a brother and sister should get along. In a way I agree. Yet, there are such brothers as Daniel, without the love of God in their hearts and no compassion for their younger sister&#8217;s treasured things, and there are younger sisters who feel irritated at their older brother&#8217;s pranks, and yet want badly to please the Lord in all things and find themselves failing in this area. In this story, Susanna is the little sister, her mother, the one who helps and encourages her to go on and gives her advice. It would be wonderful, would it not, if Daniel would get saved and thus ease a trial from his sister&#8217;s load? Ah, well, trials can but bring young Susanna closer to her Lord&#8230;.</p>

<p>But perhaps the story will not end here&#8230;. If the Lord so wills, we hope to again bring you another story of Susanna with something more that she has learned in her walk with Jesus. If, of course the editresses of this magazine feel blessed in passing it on to you. Until then, I will withdraw&#8230;. The Lord bless you all, my dear ones in Christ Jesus!</p>
