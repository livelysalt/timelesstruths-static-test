<h1>The Building of Rosie&#8217;s House</h1>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_11/building_broken.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="382" /></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8212;I didn&#8217;t do it,&#8221; Rosie stammered. She dropped her eyes from Irene&#8217;s sad face and looked at the floor instead. Pieces of broken glass lay in a pile under the dresser where she had quickly shoved them that morning. But she couldn&#8217;t tell her big sister that; she wouldn&#8217;t ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but how could it have fallen?&#8221; Irene asked, looking from Rosie to the remains of her beautiful blue-flowered pitcher. Rosie lifted her shoulders in a shrug, but her conscience pricked her hard. Irene had bought that water pitcher at the antique store only last week and it had cost her twelve dollars.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry it broke,&#8221; she managed to say, and before Irene could ask her another question, she slipped out the door and ran outside.</p>

<p>Though Rosie tried to enjoy playing with her little brother and sister, she could not. Every little bang or call made her jump and sent her heart into a flutter. What if someone <i>had</i> seen her when she had stepped on the dresser this morning and knocked the pitcher off? Irene would be terribly upset when she found out and Dad would discipline her. And she would have to pay for it&#8212;twelve whole dollars. Rosie only had ten saved in the little brown box on the shelf.</p>

<p>It was when Emma and Karl were put down for their naps and she was sitting in the chicken coop alone that Rosie thought of the lesson. Sister Margaret had told all the little children in her Sunday school class about the houses we build. What was it that she had said? &#8220;If you build with lies and hate and selfishness your house will crash. If you build with love and truth and right, you will have a house that will last.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosie thought of the straight good bricks that had stacked up well, but the crooked ones hadn&#8217;t made a good wall at all. <i>And a lie is a bad brick,</i> she thought. <i>But how can I tell them?</i> It would be so hard, and what would Daniel think of her? He thought she always told the truth.</p>

<p>But Rosie knew she hadn&#8217;t. Many times she hadn&#8217;t. Rosie looked at the chickens and tried not to think. Count the different colors&#8212;one, two, three&#8230;&#8203;five with black and white specks. And there were six red, but two had black on their chins and one was a rooster with a green tail. There had been another rooster, gold and orange, that had been Daniel&#8217;s favorite pet. He didn&#8217;t know what had killed it, but Rosie did. Maybe not telling was as bad as a lie. She bit her lip and thought hard. She <i>would</i> be a good girl and tell the truth. She must, she <i>must</i>.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_11/building_chickens.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="365" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Ro-o-sie! Where are you?&#8221; The call from the house brought Rosie&#8217;s mind back quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the chicken house!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I need some eggs. Are you collecting them?&#8221; Mom&#8217;s voice sounded closer. Rosie jumped up quickly, sending a friendly red hen squawking away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, ducking into the dim shed. Well, she was <i>now</i>, anyway. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bring them!&#8221;</p>

<p>It took less than a minute to snatch the eggs from the four nests and put them in her coat pockets. Rosie was careful to keep them from cracking together as she walked to the house. But the thoughts in her head wouldn&#8217;t stop. <i>You&#8217;re building with another broken brick,</i> they said. <i>That was a lie, and so was the time you blamed&#8212;</i> &#8220;Oh, be quiet!&#8221; Rosie said fiercely under her breath. She hurried up the steps and into the house.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>&#8220;Does anyone know how Irene&#8217;s pitcher broke?&#8221; Dad asked after prayer had been said at supper. Dad and Mom looked around the table at all their shaking heads, but they seemed to look hardest at Rosie. Her heart jumped into her throat, but suddenly she thought of something to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it was the cat&#8212;Emma might&#8217;ve let her in,&#8221; Rosie suggested. But before anyone could ask about it, there was a knock at the door and soon the topic was forgotten.</p>

<p>But as Rosie lay in her own snug bottom bunk that night, she could not forget. The broken pieces of glass glittered in the moonlight when she opened her eyes. Shutting them tight, she tried to remember a nice story, but she could only think of the foolish man that built his house upon the sand. She turned over. The bed seemed to sink under her like sand and she could imagine the waters coming and washing her away. She knew that God hated liars. But what could she do?</p>

<p>Rosie buried her face in her pillow and felt the tears wet her cheeks. All she could think of was the naughty things she had done and how many untruths she had said. What would Jesus think of her? Then she remembered that Jesus already knows everything. She seemed to see His sad, sad face. It was the face on the cross in Grandpa&#8217;s Bible-story book, with thorns poking His head and the blood running down. All of a sudden Rosie realized why He was so sad. He didn&#8217;t want her to do wrong and build a broken house. He loved her and wanted her to be happy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear Jesus,&#8221; Rosie said, clasping her hands in front of her face. &#8220;Oh, help me! I am so bad and I told a lie&#8212;lots of lies, but I&#8217;m so sorry. Please help me.&#8221; Then as she lay there, still in the dark room, she remembered that Jesus died to take away our sins and give us clean hearts. &#8220;And take away my bad heart and&#8212;and give me a white heart. I want to do right and obey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Rosie seemed to see Jesus&#8217; hand pulling her out of the pile of broken bricks. &#8220;I&#8217;ll help you build a good house,&#8221; He seemed to say. A happy, happy feeling filled her heart and she whispered, half aloud, &#8220;Oh, thank you, Jesus! Amen.&#8221; For a few minutes she lay looking out at the bright moon and thinking of Jesus building, just like her father built houses, strong and tall. A house on the rock.</p>

<p><i>But you must tell Irene and the others that you are sorry for lying to them,</i> a voice whispered in her head. Rosie felt a bit afraid of that, but she folded her hands and said, &#8220;Dear Lord, help me.&#8221; There was a creak in the bed overhead. She would tell Irene if she was awake.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Rosie?&#8221; Her older sister&#8217;s voice sounded sleepy, but her hand reached out gently when Rosie crawled up beside her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8212;I have to tell you. I broke your pitcher this morning.&#8221; Her voice felt like a mouse&#8217;s whisper, but Irene squeezed her arm. She had heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you mad at me?&#8221; Rosie asked with a quaver. &#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry&#8230;&#8203;and I&#8217;ll give you all my money in my money box, and two dollars more when I get them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Rosie, it&#8217;s all right, I forgive you,&#8221; Irene said quietly. &#8220;But why did you tell me tonight?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosie gulped, and then said, &#8220;Jesus is going to help build my house now. I prayed and said I was sorry, but He said I had to say sorry to you, too.&#8221; Irene answered that with a kiss and a warm hug.</p>

<p>Soon Rosie was curled up snugly once more. <i>Tomorrow morning I&#8217;ll tell the others,</i> she thought with a peaceful sigh. <i>Jesus will help me if I ask Him.</i></p>

<h1>The True and the False</h1>

<p>We all want to be known as smart and good, don&#8217;t we? We don&#8217;t like people making fun of us or telling the things we do wrong. When someone likes us, or admires the things we can do, we feel important. So lots of times we try to behave good just to get good things, and for others to think well of us. Right?</p>

<p>Do you know that is how most lying starts? Something happens that we don&#8217;t want to tell the truth about. Why? Because we are afraid of what others will think or say. We won&#8217;t look good or smart anymore, so we better hide it. We might get punished, and <i>that</i> is not a good thing at all. Better find a way to get out of it, quick! Blame someone else or think up &#8220;a story.&#8221; Whether it is a white lie or a black lie, it doesn&#8217;t really matter. A lie is a lie: something that is not true. It is a crumbling brick that won&#8217;t last.</p>

<p>One lie usually leads to another unless we humble down and confess it. Humbling down is like giving up all the thoughts of looking good and feeling smart. It is telling what we <i>really</i> said and what we&#8217;re <i>really</i> like. It is hard, but it is the right thing to do. It is building a strong house on a rock&#8212;a straight, good brick. It takes work and so it often seems better to tell a lie.</p>

<p>But do you know that covering up your wrong deeds is really hardest in the end? It is. First you have all those nervous feelings of &#8220;What if they find out?&#8221; Then you are guilty, but keep telling lies because you know you are doing wrong. And you won&#8217;t feel any better until you do right, so you are miserable. What a sad place to be!</p>

<p>Like Rosie, we are each building houses&#8212;houses that will crash, or houses that will last. We all want the lasting kind, but false houses are being built all the time. Why? Because it seems easier and like the best way to &#8220;look good.&#8221; You know it isn&#8217;t though, and so that is <b>false</b>. The truth is that the easiest and best way to live is to have Jesus be your builder and make your house strong and good. Not the kind of good you keep <i>trying</i> to have, but the real kind, when He gives you a clean heart to do right. That&#8217;s the <b>truth</b>.</p>

<h1>The Devoted Dog: Love</h1>

<p>We all like animals, don&#8217;t we? God made them for us to enjoy, and there are many things we can learn from them. Let&#8217;s go out to the King&#8217;s Garden and see what lesson He has to teach us today.</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_11/love_dog_b.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="204" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Woof! Woof!&#8221; Here comes the dog, wagging her tail and slapping a wet kiss on our hands. She is so friendly and sweet, devoted to us like she is part of the family. When we are ready to play she is happy to chase the stick or tumble on the lawn. When we go on a walk she frisks along, and joins us contentedly when we sit down. What a loving animal she is!</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_11/love_dog_c.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="188" /></div>
<p>The dog doesn&#8217;t mind if we are tall or short, small or big, talkative or quiet. She doesn&#8217;t laugh if we can&#8217;t do something, and she doesn&#8217;t pretend she is smarter than we are. It doesn&#8217;t matter what we&#8217;re like; the dog loves us anyway. Isn&#8217;t this the kind of love we need to have towards one another? This is the kind of love Jesus has: He loves all the people of the world, no matter how different they are. We need to ask Jesus to help us love everybody, too.</p>

<p>Another way the dog shows her love is by pleasing us. We don&#8217;t love each other if we only want our own way. Love gladly gives and makes others happy. And see how happy she is; tongue lolling out in a smile! The dog wants to please us and is glad when we are happy, whether it is running or playing, working or sitting still. Let&#8217;s have that kind of love to help Mom and Dad and play nicely with one another. And most of all, when we have love we want to please Jesus. How can we be His &#8220;devoted dog&#8221; and make Him happy today?</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like snakes,&#8221; said Alice, as her brothers exclaimed over the boa constrictor they had seen. &#8220;Is there any good reason for them, Grandpa?&#8221;</p>

<p>Grandpa leaned back in his chair. &#8220;The Bible tells us of a very special snake, and I shall tell you about it. It is called:</p>

<h1>The Bronze Serpent</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Numbers+21%3A4-9%3B+John+3%3A14-15">Numbers 21:4-9; John 3:14-15</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">There was once a boy, called Hanniel, that took a long journey with his family. This journey was a special journey, because the Lord God had delivered them and all the people of Israel from slavery in Egypt. Now they were following Moses, the leader God had given them, through the desert to freedom. What an exciting trip it was for Hanniel! They had gone through the sea, past enemies, and a great mountain. And every day the Lord sent manna from heaven for food.</p>

<p>Even so, Hanniel was getting very tired of travelling. He complained to his father, &#8220;When will we get there? Can&#8217;t I have something else to eat?&#8221; Everyone else was complaining, too, and soon a crowd of people went to speak to Moses. &#8220;We&#8217;re thirsty and tired. Did you bring us out here to die?&#8221; Then suddenly something dreadful happened. Out of the rocks and behind the bushes serpents began to appear!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; screamed Hanniel&#8217;s mother, running into the tent with the baby. But when Hanniel looked in the tent, he saw a snake slithering across the floor. Just when he was about to throw a rock at it, his friend, Joktan, yelled, &#8220;Watch out!&#8221; Hanniel jumped just in time to miss the sharp fangs of a huge snake behind him. He had to keep hopping from rock to rock to keep from the coiling, snapping serpents that were everywhere. Hanniel watched in horror as little Dinah was bitten, swelled up, and turned blue from the poison. Many people were dying and there was nothing they could do!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, God have mercy on us!&#8221; Hanniel&#8217;s father cried, clutching his wrist where a wriggling golden snake still clung. When Hanniel felt the sharp fangs snap into his own leg, he began praying, too. &#8220;Forgive me for complaining! I have done wrong&#8212;please save me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The poison was puffing his leg when shouting came from the middle of the camp. Joktan ran up breathless and grabbed Hanniel&#8217;s arm. &#8220;Look&#8212;there is Moses and a pole with a bronze serpent on it. If you look at it, God says you will not die.&#8221; Hanniel staggered to his feet and tried to see, but a man blocked his way. Quickly, though his leg hurt dreadfully, he pulled himself up a rocky slope with Joktan&#8217;s help. There at last&#8212;he could see Moses holding up the pole. Around it twisted a fiery golden snake.</p>

<p>As Hanniel looked, he believed God&#8217;s promise and felt the pain leave his leg. How wonderful it was! Hanniel hurried to find his father and mother so they could get help, too. God had given the bronze snake to save them all!</p>

<p>Hundreds of years later, Jesus spoke to Nicodemus about this snake of brass: <span class="scripture">&#8220;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+3%3A14-15" title="John 3:14-15"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 3:14-15)</span></a></span></p>

</blockquote>


<p>Grandpa stopped his story, then asked Sammy, &#8220;Who is that Son of man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jesus,&#8221; Sammy said. &#8220;He died on the cross for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and that was just like the snake being lifted up,&#8221; Alice mused.</p>

<p>&#8220;How else is it the same?&#8221; Grandpa looked at Edward this time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because they had to believe,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You know, believe so that they could be saved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they repented first,&#8221; Alice said.</p>

<p>Grandpa tipped his head. &#8220;And can you remember <i>where</i> the serpent was put?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On a pole up high so people could see it,&#8221; said Edward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Grandpa. &#8220;And when Jesus saves us, we need to hold Him up for others to see Him. How do we do that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By letting our light shine and obeying,&#8221; suggested Edward.</p>

<p>&#8220;And helping Mama,&#8221; said Sammy.</p>

<p>&#8220;By not listening to the devil and doing wrong,&#8221; said Alice. &#8220;When Jesus helps us live right all the time, that is lifting Him up.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Eliza Makes Her Wrongs Right</h1>

<p>Eliza was a girl who was reared by parents who loved the Lord. They lived for Him and taught their children to do the same. They taught them how to be saved by faith in Jesus who died on the cross for their sins, and if they confessed their sins to Him and asked Him to forgive them, He would do that. They taught them how God wanted them to live according to the Bible, to tell the truth about anything that happened and not to take anything that did not belong to them. Eliza prayed every day in family worship. She loved the Lord but she didn&#8217;t live very close to Him at times.</p>

<p>One day after erasing the school blackboard, she was tempted to do something wrong. Everyone had gone, and as Eliza was walking down the aisle she passed Margaret&#8217;s desk. On the desk was a matchbox holding a little china doll. Margaret had brought it to school at different times and Eliza thought it was the cutest little doll she had ever seen. Her parents didn&#8217;t think they could afford a doll, so she sometimes wrapped up a stick, a bottle, or something soft when she wanted to play with one.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_11/eliza_doll.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="167" /></div>
<p>As Eliza stopped and looked at the doll, something whispered to her, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you take it home with you? No one will ever know.&#8221; Eliza had never stolen anything in her life and she felt shaky about it, but she looked around and no one was in sight. Quickly she put the doll into her pocket and walked out of the room. Eliza hurried home, being afraid someone might have seen her. At home she took it out of her pocket and looked at it. Her sister wanted to see it, and, of course, Mother&#8217;s eagle eye saw it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did that doll come from?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>Eliza thought quickly and said, &#8220;Old Tennessee gave it to me.&#8221; Old Tennessee was a colored man who often came by the house in his wagon and let them look over the junk that he had collected.</p>

<p>Eliza&#8217;s mother turned back to her work, but the stolen doll didn&#8217;t look so pretty anymore. She shoved it in her</p>

<p>dresser drawer, but somehow it could not be forgotten. Something inside Eliza made her feel remorse and guilt. She didn&#8217;t feel like praying that evening, and went to bed early because nothing seemed interesting. But could not go to sleep or stop thinking about the doll. If wishing could have put that doll back on Margaret&#8217;s desk, it would have been there.</p>

<p>Sorrow filled her heart because now she was a thief. Over and over she thought about going back to school the next day. What if someone had seen her take the doll? What if she was caught? At these thoughts she trembled, and before the night was over many tears had been shed, but she could not decide what to do. Eliza was afraid to take the doll back because they would call her a thief. The only thing to do was just to go to school and take a chance that no one would know who took the doll.</p>

<p>Eliza was a very unhappy girl the next morning as she went to school, afraid to go to her room. But no one said a word about the doll and it didn&#8217;t seem that anyone missed it. Eliza was glad, but she wished that the doll were back in Margaret&#8217;s possession. Every time she thought of it a guilty feeling would sweep over her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you break the doll and throw it away? Then you won&#8217;t feel bad any more,&#8221; a thought said. So Eliza took the doll out into the alley, got a rock, and smashed it into small pieces and scattered it around. Still she could not forget that she had stolen, and lied to her family, and disobeyed God. Her prayers did not seem to mean very much anymore and she was a miserable little girl.</p>

<p>Time passed, and at times the stolen doll would not come to her mind, and at other times it would trouble her greatly. Eliza knew she had sinned; that it stood between her and God, and she would have to make it right and confess to Margaret that she had taken the doll. Poor Eliza was sure Margaret would tell everyone in school and they would call her a thief.</p>

<p>One time, after school was out in the spring, a minister came to hold a meeting at the chapel where Eliza went to services with her parents. He preached on hell, and said that if people who disobeyed God didn&#8217;t clear up their lives and ask God to forgive them, they would go to that place of eternal punishment where fire and brimstone were never quenched. Eliza trembled as she listened. That was a place to be shunned! But after thinking about it all, it seemed too hard for her to make her wrongs right.</p>

<p>Eliza&#8217;s mind was not left in peace. One night after services were over and she went to bed, sleep did not come to bring relief to her troubled mind. So great was her misery that she rolled and tumbled, cried and cried. She wanted to get saved and be ready for heaven, but the thought of being called a thief at school when she made her confession was to her unbearable. It seemed a load like the mattress was on top of her instead of her being on the mattress. It was terrible! Finally she cried to the Lord, &#8220;I&#8217;ll get saved and make it right!&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_11/eliza_praying.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="222" /></div>
<p>She decided that as soon as she heard the alarm go off in her parents&#8217; bedroom the next morning she would go and ask her father to pray for her to get saved. That decision brought some relief to her troubled soul, but it seemed like hours before the alarm went off. When she ran into their bedroom, she told her father that she wanted to get saved and he was happy to pray for her. Eliza prayed, too, asking God to forgive her and save her from her sins, which He did. She knew she would not see Margaret until school started in the fall, but she promised the Lord she would make it right with her when she could. Eliza arose from her knees a happy girl, the load lifted from her soul. Oh, how she loved God for forgiving her and saving her soul!</p>

<p>Summer passed. The time had been spent in much prayer and doing things to please the Lord, but Eliza did not forget her promise to God. She had not told one soul about what she had done&#8212;none knew but God. One day after school started she was sitting behind Margaret in study hall, so she reached out to tap her. When she turned, Eliza said, &#8220;Do you remember that little china doll you had last year in school? I want you to forgive me for taking it home with me. Tell me how much it cost and I&#8217;ll pay you for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wondered what had happened to that doll,&#8221; Margaret answered. &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to pay me anything for it. I didn&#8217;t care very much for it, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I took it,&#8221; Eliza said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just forget it; that&#8217;s all right.&#8221; And how happy Eliza was to have it off her mind and soul! She felt so light and happy. She thought about how much she had suffered over that little doll only to hear Margaret say it didn&#8217;t mean very much to her. But Eliza knew that she had disobeyed God by stealing, and that God had made her feel guilty over it. God loved her and wanted her to go to heaven so He dealt with her until she made it right.</p>

<p>But there was still the lie to make right with her family. How could she do it? She felt so bad to think that she had been a thief and it hurt her to let them know about it. She thought it through and decided that it would be easier to tell all of them at once what she had done and ask their forgiveness. Eliza was only twelve years old, but God made her know that to get everything clear between herself and God she must clear it up with others, too.</p>

<p>When the family all gathered for worship, she tried to speak, but broke down and started to cry. Her father asked her what was the trouble, and she got quieted enough to tell him, then ask forgiveness. Eliza told them she had stolen the doll and had lied when she told them Old Tennessee had given it to her. Her father said that they forgave her, and Eliza was very happy to have confessed it. Now it was all clear, for she had made everything right between herself and God and others, also.</p>

<h2>Something You Can Do</h2>
<p>Do you want to make something useful that&#8217;s cozy and soft, too? Do you like stuffed animals or know someone else that does? How about a cuddly dog friend that will keep your pajamas safely hidden all day, and then give them to you at bedtime? You can keep him on your bed or give him as a special gift. Ask Mom or Big Sister and see if she can help you get started on sewing your very own</p>

<h1>Devoted Dog Pajama Bag</h1>

<p>You will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>two pieces of sturdy fabric (18&#8221; x 12&#8221;) for the dog body</li>

<li>felt for tail, ears, and nose</li>

<li>scissors</li>

<li>needle and thread</li>

<li>snaps or zipper (to close the bag)</li>

</ul>
<div class="center"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_11/pajama_bag.jpg" alt="" width="710" height="396" /></div>
<ol>
<li>Follow pattern A: First draw the shape on a 18&#8220;x12&#8221; piece of paper, then use it to cut out the fabric. Cut two pieces for the body and pin them carefully <b>right sides together</b>.</li>

<li>Sew <i>backstitch</i> or by machine all around the curved edge (leave the bottom open).</li>

<li>Turn the body right-side out. Now cut the tail, ears, and nose out of felt fabric.</li>

<li><i>Whip stitch</i> the nose, ears, and tail on your dog with a needle and thread.</li>

<li>To add the legs and eyes, <i>outline stitch</i> the lines like the picture shows. Keep one hand between fabrics, so they won&#8217;t be stitched together.</li>

<li>Ask someone to help you sew a zipper or snaps along your dog&#8217;s tummy opening.</li>

</ol>
<p>If you did a good, careful job, your dog will be strong enough to hold your pajamas and cute enough to be a cuddly friend.</p>

<p><b>Idea:</b> Make the pajama bag look like your very own devoted dog. Does he have long ears or a short tail? Ask someone to help you cut out the right shapes and pick the right colors.</p>

<h1>The King&#8217;s Call</h1>

<p>Do you know what bondage is? It is being a slave that must do what his master says. Each of us is in bondage today unless we have been freed by Jesus. We may be slaves to Bad Tempers or Lying. We might be slaves to Fearfulness or Thinking-I&#8217;m-the-Best. Or our master might be Complaints or Me-First. Have you heard of any of these? The devil is master of them all, and this is the camp of sin.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_11/call_slaves.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="219" /></div>
<p>Just like the Israelites were freed from Pharaoh and Egypt, Jesus wants to lead us to freedom in the Promised Land. There we can be conquering soldiers with Him. Do you know what the Promised Land is like? It is full of kindness and love and sunshine, because the King of Righteousness rules there. But it takes brave soldiers to live there, because there are enemies to fight. Wouldn&#8217;t you like to be a soldier? Strong and brave and able to knock down all the bad guys? Of course!</p>

<p>Do you know that Jesus is the most powerful general in the universe? He is able to conquer all the devil&#8217;s army, and He does. He wants soldiers like you to follow Him. He will teach you to fight every enemy Wrong-Thought that comes along. <div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_11/call_escape.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="345" /></div>You can be a soldier for Right in His Kingdom, but you will have to volunteer. No one will make you. Here is a special message the King asked us to send to you:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noindent first">Dear Want-to-be-Soldier:</p>

<p>I have certain requirements for you to meet before you can join My army. For one thing, you cannot have a black heart of sin. That is the sign of the enemy camp. So I&#8217;ve set up a pool of cleansing for your heart to be made white. My Son, Jesus Christ, paid for your escape with His life.</p>

<p>You must leave the enemy camp and come down to the bloodstained cross on the hill. There I will be waiting to meet you and make you ready to enter My Kingdom. I have set up the way&#8212;won&#8217;t you come and be Mine?</p>

<p class="signature">For Jesus&#8217; sake,<br />The King of Righteousness</p>

<h1>No TV? II</h1>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s be Power Rangers,&#8221; said Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are they?&#8221; said Billy. The boys were playing in Billy&#8217;s treehouse. Billy&#8217;s Daddy had helped him to build it. It had a real roof and everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;They wear special clothes that make them able to jump a long ways. They can run very fast, and they help people who are in trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do they help them?&#8221; Billy asked. He was thinking about the Good Samaritan that his Dad had read about the other night. He helped a man who had been robbed and beaten.</p>

<p>&#8220;They beat up the bad guys,&#8221; said Johnny. He swung his fist at a pretend bad guy in the air. &#8220;Wham!&#8221; he hollered. &#8220;Pow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds like what the bad guys do,&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;They hit people and hurt them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8230;&#8203;the Power Rangers hit the bad guys for a different reason,&#8221; Johnny protested. Soon he went home and sat down in front of the TV. It was time for the Power Rangers show. The music started and the Power Rangers jumped onto the screen. They wore bright clothes, and could run and jump better than anyone else. They could really beat up bad guys, too. But Johnny kept thinking about why they did it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mom,&#8221; he called, &#8220;why do Power Rangers try to help people?&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny&#8217;s mother looked at her husband. Finally Jonny&#8217;s dad said, &#8220;Johnny, they do it for the money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; said Johnny. He had never seen the Power Rangers given any money.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all make-believe, Johnny,&#8221; Mother said. &#8220;The people you see on the screen are not even boys and girls. They are grownups who are paid to act like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; said Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s all about money,&#8221; Daddy said. &#8220;If it will sell, companies pay money to show it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t want to try to help people?&#8221; said Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not at all,&#8221; said Daddy. He looked at Mother and asked, &#8220;Remember that scripture that Billy&#8217;s father read in our Bible study last time?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother nodded seriously. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, <span class="scripture">&#8220;Provide things honest in the sight of all men.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+12%3A17" title="Romans 12:17"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Romans 12:17)</span></a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;This TV is no good,&#8221; said Daddy thoughtfully. &#8220;What good there is, is mixed with bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And there&#8217;s a lot of bad,&#8221; said Mother very quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get rid of it,&#8221; said Johnny, a little surprised a his own words. &#8220;Let&#8217;s really help people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want to watch Power Rangers, anymore?&#8221; Daddy asked Johnny. Johnny nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s do it, Frank,&#8221; Johnny&#8217;s mother said, with tears in her eyes. &#8220;Honey, I feel that I need to live better. I want to get right with God. And I don&#8217;t feel that I can live right if I watch this thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother and Daddy carried the television to the back yard dump. Johnny hollered to Billy. &#8220;Come on, Billy! We&#8217;re throwing away the TV!&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy came running, carring a hammer. The television hit the trash barrel with a loud crash, and he asked, &#8220;Do you want me to hit it with my hammer, Mr. Johnson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir!&#8221; said Johnny&#8217;s daddy in a determined tone of voice. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get a hammer, too.&#8221; They smiled with satisfaction as they fixed that television so no one could watch it again. Then they all went in and read the story of the Good Samaritan, who helped people in trouble for the right reasons.</p>

<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<p>I am Aunt Faith, and I&#8217;m writing a letter to you because Aunt Grace couldn&#8217;t. Would you like to hear about an adventure that Princess Precious had and the lesson she learned?</p>

<p>It was a cold day, but Precious and her brother, Prince Valiant, had decided to go on a hike with Valiant&#8217;s new binoculars. They followed the lane through the woods and stopped in a meadow. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been here before,&#8221; said Prince Valiant, leading the way on a twisting path to a hill. They saw a robin and two chickadees, an anthill, and far away a great big bird.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it an eagle?&#8221; wondered Precious. &#8220;We could climb up the hill to see better.&#8221; Valiant tucked his binoculars inside their case and started climbing up the rough rocks. The path was steep, so Precious grabbed a stick to help her along. They climbed and climbed until the woods were left far behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look how far we can see!&#8221; cried Valiant when they had reached a level spot on the cliff. Out across the treetops they could see the farmland, houses, and roads.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve come a long ways,&#8221; said Precious. &#8220;Too bad we didn&#8217;t bring a lunch.&#8221; She was looking up into the gray sky when suddenly a shrill squeak came from the rocks nearby. Turning quickly, Precious was surprised to see a small furry animal with round ears disappear in a crack.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_11/letter_cony.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="169" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Did you see that?&#8221; whispered Valiant. Precious nodded, pointing to a big, brown bird flying over the hill. &#8220;Oh, I know,&#8221; said Valiant, &#8220;That animal was hiding from the hawk! Do you think it was a cony, like the one we read about in the Bible?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, for remember? They hide in the rocks when trouble comes. Shhh! Maybe it will come out again,&#8221; said Precious. They waited for a long time, hardly breathing. The breeze got colder and dark clouds blew in.</p>

<p>&#8220;We better go home before it rains,&#8221; said Valiant, so they started down the rocks. But drops began to fall when they were only halfway down. The rocks began to get slippery and Precious scraped her knee. Finally they reached the edge of the woods and ducked under the trees. But where was the trail?</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;re lost,&#8221; said Valiant, looking worried. &#8220;What shall we do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220; <span class="scripture">&#8216;What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee,&#8217;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Psalm+56%3A3" title="Psalm 56:3"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Psalm 56:3)</span></a></span> Psalm 56:3,&#8221; Precious said, wiping the raindrops from her face. &#8220;That was my Bible verse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, let&#8217;s ask King Jesus to help us,&#8221; said Valiant. Together they bowed their heads and prayed. When they had finished, Valiant jumped up. &#8220;I remember there was a tall stump where we started up the hill&#8212;see it over there!&#8221; How happy the two children were to find the path and be hurrying home!</p>

<p>&#8220;We were like the little cony,&#8221; said Precious, when she had told the story to Princess Joy. &#8220;When trouble came we hid in our Rock for safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, dear princesses, that is what we must do, too. For, like the conies, we are but a &#8220;feeble folk,&#8221; and our only strength is when we trust Jesus to help us.</p>

<p>Love, Aunt Faith</p>
