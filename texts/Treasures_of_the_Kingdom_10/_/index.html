<h1>Daniel and the Boys</h1>

<p>&#8220;Come on, boys&#8212;let&#8217;s race the train!&#8221; Trace called, stretching his long legs to reach the railroad siding before the others. Daniel was on his heels, with his friend, Pete, puffing at his side, when the long shriek of the train whistle sounded in their ears. In a second it was roaring past and the boys slowed down, their breath puffing out like steam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheaters,&#8221; black-haired Jos&eacute; [ho-ZAY] complained. &#8220;You guys got a head start.&#8221; He plopped down in the frosted grass, and the other boys joined him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nah, foot start,&#8221; said small, freckle-faced Neil, with a laugh. &#8220;But can&#8217;t we play ball now?&#8221; He pulled a ball out of his coat pocket and Pete held up the bat he had brought along.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_10/daniel_baseball.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="301" /></div>
<p>When Trace said he should be first pitcher, Daniel grinned. He felt important to be noticed by Pete&#8217;s older cousin, and he liked softball. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure glad I could come over today,&#8221; he told Pete when they started the third round. &#8220;This is fun!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, guys, next week&#8217;s Christmas break!&#8221; Pete said, excitedly. &#8220;Maybe you all could come over an&#8217;&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we can have a campout,&#8221; finished Trace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; asked Jos&eacute;, wrinkling his nose. &#8220;Wanna freeze into icicles?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, stupid,&#8221; Trace said, &#8220;my uncle has a big old barn and there are lots of neat hide-outs, so all we&#8217;ll need are some sleeping bags and flashlights.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I still think I&#8217;d freeze.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who cares?&#8221; said Neil. &#8220;Frozen Jos&eacute;&#8212;yum, yum!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, shut-up!&#8221; Jos&eacute; snapped, then he looked at Daniel. &#8220;Maybe Dan can&#8217;t come, since he&#8217;s home-schooled. Home-schoolers no go to school, so maybe no sleep-outs either.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel felt his ears get red. &#8220;It sounds fun,&#8221; he said, glancing from Trace to Pete. &#8220;I&#8217;d sure like to, but I&#8217;ll have to ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ll talk to my dad tonight,&#8221; Trace said, slapping the softball into his palm. &#8220;I&#8217;ll call you guys up if it&#8217;s a go.&#8221; He tossed the ball up and caught it, then walked back to where he had been pitching. Neil grabbed up the bat and the rest of the boys scattered outfield once again.</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>The light was fading from the gray sky when Daniel came home, and Rosie met him at the door. &#8220;What were you doing all afternoon?&#8221; she said impatiently, while he took off his coat and cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, just playing ball with Pete and some other boys.&#8221; Daniel headed for his bedroom, planning how he could persuade Mom and Dad to let him go to the sleep-out. Camping in a barn would be super fun. They&#8217;d play games in the dark&#8212;maybe even flashlight tag, and&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could you play ball, Daniel?&#8221; It was Rosie again. &#8220;Pete&#8217;s house doesn&#8217;t have a big enough yard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We played in the big field at the end of the road, stupid&#8212;&#8221; Daniel hadn&#8217;t meant to say it, but the word just slipped out. He glanced up to see Mom&#8217;s face in the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daniel.&#8221; Mom&#8217;s voice was very quiet. &#8220;You know that isn&#8217;t a kind word to use. Why did you say it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8212;I didn&#8217;t mean to,&#8221; Daniel said quickly. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Rosie; really.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s okay,&#8221; Rosie said, &#8220;but can you make a fort with me?&#8221; Daniel followed her to the living room, but nothing seemed interesting except the plans for next week. It wasn&#8217;t until he began clearing the supper table that the phone rang.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Daniel,&#8221; Trace&#8217;s voice said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got it all planned for next Wednesday night. All of you can come to Pete&#8217;s house and his dad will take us over&#8212;oh, yeah, and remember a sleeping bag and flashlight. We&#8217;ll meet at five o&#8217;clock, okay?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I still have to ask, but I&#8217;ll tell you tomorrow.&#8221; Daniel hung up the phone and went to find Dad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll talk to Mom and think it over,&#8221; was all Dad would say.</p>

<p>Daniel walked slowly back to the kitchen. <i>Oh, just say yes,</i> his thoughts pleaded. <i>Why would there be anything wrong with it, anyway?</i></p>

<p>But Dad seemed to find plenty wrong with the idea. &#8220;Daniel, there are several reasons why we can&#8217;t agree to let you camp out with the boys,&#8221; Dad said the next morning. &#8220;It&#8217;s far away, for one thing, and Wednesday night is prayer meeting night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel frowned and bit his lip as Dad continued, &#8220;Then, too, Mom and I don&#8217;t want you sticking around those boys too much. Their attitude is rubbing on you, and boys in a crowd like that easily get into a lot of trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Dad, we just have fun together&#8212;we won&#8217;t do anything bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you wouldn&#8217;t want to,&#8221; Dad said kindly, &#8220;but someone else might lead you into it, and it&#8217;s easy to forget what&#8217;s right then.&#8221; Dad looked at the kitchen clock. &#8220;I have to make a trip to the hardware store before starting work today. Care to come along? I want to do something special with my big Number Nine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel shrugged, but Dad&#8217;s big grin won him over. Soon they were rattling down the road in the beat-up Ford truck. &#8220;Dad?&#8221; Daniel asked after a bit. &#8220;Was it because of what I said to Rosie last night, about her being stupid?&#8221;</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_10/daniel_driving.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="279" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Partly,&#8221; Dad said, reaching over to pat Daniel&#8217;s knee. &#8220;Don&#8217;t the boys often say unkind things?&#8221; Daniel knew the boys said many bad words, and swore a lot, too. But he had <i>really</i> wanted to go along.</p>

<p>Dad seemed to understand. &#8220;I remember feeling just like you when I was a boy. It seemed terrible that I couldn&#8217;t go away to summer camp like the other boys did. My parents didn&#8217;t want me to be off somewhere without them, but I didn&#8217;t feel like I needed watching. Besides, everyone else&#8217;s parents didn&#8217;t mind so much. I felt left out of the fun.&#8221; The truck slowed down to turn, and Daniel looked up at Dad&#8217;s strong face. <i>Had he really felt the same way once?</i></p>

<p>&#8220;But, even though it seemed hard, I&#8217;m glad they did it. Those same boys later would have got me in a lot of trouble&#8212;my good friend began smoking and, later, stealing, because he got into the wrong crowd. I wouldn&#8217;t want that to happen to you.&#8221; Dad&#8217;s eyes glanced over and met Daniel&#8217;s. &#8220;But I <i>do</i> want you to have fun. Can you trust me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Daniel nodded his head slowly. &#8220;It just seemed fun, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; he said with a sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Dad agreed, &#8220;but if I say that I&#8217;m taking you to Dairy Queen to get a shake, will you ask me to stop at the first building in town? No, because you know I&#8217;ll take you to the right place. That&#8217;s what trust is&#8212;believing that I care and will do the best for you. We have to do that with God all the time; trust Him when things don&#8217;t look so good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Daniel, as they parked. &#8220;Can we do something fun together&#8212;you and I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; Dad said with a wink. &#8220;How about a Dairy Queen shake?&#8221;</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_10/Who_Should_I_Trust/index.html">Who Should I Trust?</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Who Should I Trust?</h1>

<p>Daniel&#8217;s dad talked about trust. Do you know that we always trust something? Some people trust scientists that say the earth is a million years old and that we all came from apes. Other people trust in anything that seems good to them. Daniel was trusting in his own ideas and thought that the plan to spend the night with the other boys was good. But in the end he trusted his dad, even though he didn&#8217;t let Daniel go. It is good to trust our parents because they know more, but who knows the most of all and loves us the most? Yes, God. He is the highest and best and created the whole world, so of course He will know best how to take care of us.</p>

<p>Trust is believing that something is true and depending on it. You trust that your bed won&#8217;t fall apart, then you depend on it and lie down to rest, without worrying about it breaking. We trust that our food isn&#8217;t poisoned, and eat it. We trust that there is gravity and jump up, because we know we will come down again. We trust that our parents will take care of us, and that it will get light in the morning. And we trust that God loves us, and that the Bible is true.</p>

<p>If we listen to the devil he will try to make us afraid of trusting. You say to yourself: &#8220;What if my bed breaks when I lie down?&#8221; &#8220;What if my food is poisoned?&#8221; &#8220;What if Dad forgets to pick me up?&#8221; If you think about all the &#8220;What if?&#8221; questions you will begin to worry and not trust. And some of the worries are so silly if you really think about them! If someone lied all the time, we would soon learn not to believe what that person said. But whatever God says has always come true, so we can always trust Him. If the devil tries to make you feel afraid and worried, just say, &#8220;Go away! I believe God will take care of me because He has promised to.&#8221;</p>

<p>We can trust that what God tells us is true. He says stealing is wrong, so do you think thieves will go to heaven? The Bible says only good and pure things will be in heaven. If we believe that, we will ask God to make us good and pure so that we can go there. God says that we should love our enemies, rather than hate them. But what if it doesn&#8217;t <i>seem</i> true? Maybe Dad calls to say he will be home soon. If he doesn&#8217;t come right away, will you still believe him? Many times we have to wait when we are trusting God.</p>

<p>Trusting God is a happy way to live. We don&#8217;t have to complain or grumble, even when we don&#8217;t like things, because God says that He always gives us what is best. We don&#8217;t have to hit or grab back our toy, because Jesus says we will be much happier when we give than when we get things. We don&#8217;t have to be afraid when we are left alone, for Jesus says He will always be with us. Will you trust Him?</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_10/Winter_Sprouts/index.html">Winter Sprouts</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Winter Sprouts</h1>

<p>What is winter like? Cold and wet or icy, with maybe some snow and wind? Winter is not a good time for a garden to grow, because the ground is hard and the air is so cold that the seeds wouldn&#8217;t want to sprout. But you don&#8217;t have to be gloomy; there is something you can do. You can grow sprouts in your kitchen!</p>

<p>Sprouts are seeds that just have begun to grow. They are very good on salad or sandwiches and they are easy to start in a jar or sprouting tray. If you don&#8217;t have the tray, you will need to get a wide-mouth quart jar, a canning ring, and a piece of loose-weave cloth. You will also need some seeds. Use an alfalfa seed mix for a good flavor.</p>

<p>It takes less than a week to make sprouts. Isn&#8217;t that much faster than lettuce, which takes two months? Follow this recipe for a quick crunch you grew all yourself!</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Day 1: Measure 2 tablespoons of seeds into the jar and add enough water to cover the seeds an inch. Put the jar in a cupboard overnight&#8212;but don&#8217;t forget it!</p>

<p>Day 2: Lay the cloth over the jar top and screw on the ring. (If you are using a tray, pour the seeds into it instead.) Tip the jar over into the sink and pour out the water. Now rinse by pouring water into the jar (through the cloth) and shake your seeds around. Dump the water out again and set the jar on its side in the cupboard. In the evening rinse the seeds again.</p>

<p>Days 3 and 4: Rinse the seeds a couple times a day. The seeds use that water to grow&#8212;don&#8217;t you see their roots getting longer?</p>

<p>Day 5: After rinsing one last time, set the sprout jar on the counter so the new little leaves can get a bit green. Now they are ready to eat&#8212;try grabbing a pinch to see what they taste like. To keep them fresh, put them in a closed container in the fridge.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Just like the other times in the King&#8217;s Garden, there is something for us to learn while we grow things. Don&#8217;t you know that there are lots of times it is hard to be cheerful and kind? It is like a stormy winter day when plants don&#8217;t want to grow. Maybe someone scolded you or stepped on your toe, or you couldn&#8217;t do something you had planned on. It doesn&#8217;t seem like a good time to grow obedience or smiles, does it? But Jesus has a way for us to &#8220;sprout&#8221; on those stormy winter days. He wants us to grow in His house&#8212;by staying near Him and asking for His help. He has a special &#8220;living water&#8221; that will help our little roots grow when there is no good, soft soil around. The &#8220;living water&#8221; is the grace and patience and kindness He will give us if we ask Him. So let&#8217;s be &#8220;sprouts&#8221; for Jesus on those cold winter days!</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_10/Recipe_poem_and_verse/index.html">Recipe, poem, and verse</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Recipe, poem, and verse</h1>

<hr />
<h2>This Recipe Makes: A Pomander Ball</h2>
<p>Ask if you can use these things:</p>

<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_10/pomander_supplies.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="91" /></div>
<ul>
<li>an orange or apple</li>

<li>1/2 c. whole cloves</li>

<li>a nail or other sharp thing</li>

<li>18 inches of ribbon</li>

<li>a foot-square piece of netting (optional)</li>

</ul>
<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_10/pomander_cloves.jpg" alt="" width="125" height="94" /></div>
<p>First find someone to help you. Begin by punching holes on the fruit close together. Press a clove into each hole. Keep punching holes and putting cloves in until the fruit is covered. Cloves smell good and preserve the fruit as it dries. We want our lives to smell good to God and others.</p>

<p>Put your pomander ball with your clothes or give it to someone special. To hang it up you will need to wrap the ribbon around it (between the cloves) and tie a bow with a loop to hang it by. If you have netting, put the clove ball in it and tie it up with the ribbon.</p>

<hr />
<h2>A Beautiful Smell</h2>
<p class="verse">Show to others a happy smile,
<br />It is to Jesus a sight worthwhile;
<br />Sing as you work for Mother dear,
<br />That is the sound that He likes to hear;
<br />Kindly help when someone has need,
<br />He will delight in that kind of deed;
<br />Give up your way, and know that this
<br />Is to Jesus like hugs and a kiss;
<br />Always live to please Him well&#8212;
<br />That, to God, is a beautiful smell.</p>

<hr />
<h2>A verse to hide in your heart:</h2>
<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+5%3A1-2" title="Ephesians 5:1-2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 5:1-2)</span></a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Grandpa, I&#8217;m tired of staying inside,&#8221; Sammy said, looking out at the slushy rain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I tell you a story?&#8221; Grandpa asked, and Sammy bounced up and down. &#8220;Well then, this is a story you have heard before, but today I&#8217;ll call it&#8212;</p>

<h1>The Righteous Man</h1>

<p>(Reference: <a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Genesis+6%3B+Hebrews+11%3A7">Genesis 6; Hebrews 11:7</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Japheth was the youngest son, and had learned to obey when he was small. He had two older brothers and lived with his father and mother a long, long time ago. Like other boys, I&#8217;m sure he loved to run and play and find out things. &#8220;Why do sheep live on the land and a fish live in the water?&#8221; he would ask. &#8220;Because that is the way God made them to be,&#8221; Father would say. Father was a righteous man, which means that He loved and obeyed God.</p>

<p>Sometimes Japheth&#8217;s questions were hard for Father to answer, like, &#8220;How come not many people want to obey God?&#8221; Father would stop his work to look past the green fields to the cities. Japheth knew many wicked people lived there&#8212;people that didn&#8217;t love God and only thought of themselves. Sometimes his uncles and aunts would come and tell them of the exciting life in the cities and how fun it was there.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is in their hearts to think evil and do wrong things,&#8221; Father would say. &#8220;They think it is fun to cheat and lie and steal, but God is not pleased.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why is it bad to go and see the contests and games that the other boys talk about?&#8221; asked Japheth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think that watching men beat each other and try to make themselves look the biggest and best is something good?&#8221; Father shook his head and said, &#8220;No, my son, it is much better to love and obey God.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Japheth learned to work and help at home. He learned to pray to God, and play fair, and love those around him. He believed that his father was right. It was best to follow God&#8217;s way, even when others would call him stupid and strange.</p>

<p>Then there came a day when people really thought they were strange. It began when God told Father that the whole earth and all wicked people would be destroyed. God also told Father that He would save them, because they had lived pleasing to Him. Father was given special instructions for how to build a giant boat called an ark. Why would they need such a thing? God had said that He would send a flood, and so Father and his family believed Him.</p>

<p>And how the people laughed when they saw them begin to build it! It did seem strange to be building a huge boat out in their field, but Japheth worked hard hauling and sawing wood with his brothers. Day after day they worked, often getting very tired, but never giving up. People came to watch, but they did not believe Father&#8217;s warning. But Japheth knew that he was doing what was right, because obeying God was best.</p>

<p>When Grandpa stopped telling the story, Sammy bounced up and down. &#8220;I know, I know!&#8221; he said, &#8220;It was Noah&#8217;s ark!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought it was, because of the name <i>Japheth</i>,&#8221; said Alice, who had come in to listen. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t it take a hundred years to build the ark?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it does seem that it took a long time,&#8221; Grandpa agreed. &#8220;And can you tell me what happened next, Sammy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The animals came in, and then it rained and rained until everything drowned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure that they were very glad to be safe then,&#8221; said Grandpa. He winked at Sammy. &#8220;Do you think they got tired of staying inside all the time? They had to be in the ark for more than a <i>hundred</i> days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they had the animals, so that would be fun,&#8221; said Sammy.</p>

<p>&#8220;And work, too,&#8221; Alice added. &#8220;But even if it was hard, they were glad that they were saved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Grandpa. &#8220;Saved because they obeyed God even when others didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p class="first">From <i>Mother&#8217;s Story Box</i></p>
</blockquote>


<h1>Blueberries and Bunnies</h1>

<p>David and Nancy and Little Sister Joy had been picking blueberries with Mother. Now they were going home to dinner, with their berry baskets full. As they were crossing a field they saw ahead of them&#8212;right in their path&#8212;a funny little brown bunch. At first they thought it was a piece of velvety brown fungus. But no&#8212;the round little bunch had long brown ears and a tiny wad of cotton for a tail. I&#8217;m very glad Trixie did see it. He was off chasing a woodchuck at the moment. But if he had spied that wee brown bunch, he would surely have made a rush for it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bunny!&#8221; said David.</p>

<p>&#8220;A baby bunny!&#8221; cried Nancy and Little Sister Joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush! Go softly, children,&#8221; Mother warned them. &#8220;Don&#8217;t scare it away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Softly, softly, they stole up to the wee bunny. It kept as still as a stone. Nancy put down her berry basket and bent over the wild brown baby. Gently she picked it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, isn&#8217;t he darling! Isn&#8217;t he sweet! Let&#8217;s take him home and keep him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we&#8217;ll keep him,&#8221; said David, stroking the little, brown, furry ball. But just then Trixie came running back, and David had to catch him quick and hold him tight, lest he scare poor bunny.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; said Mother, &#8220;Baby Bunny won&#8217;t be very happy, if we take him home&#8212;even if we teach Trixie not to disturb him. He&#8217;s a <i>wild</i> bunny, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s <i>tame</i>,&#8221; said Little Sister Joy. &#8220;Just see how tame he is!&#8221; She kissed the bunny.</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t even <i>try</i> to run away, when I picked him up,&#8221; said Nancy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bunny kept still, hoping we would not notice him,&#8221; said Mother. &#8220;But his little heart was beating with fright when you caught him. Suppose you were out, all alone, and three big giants came along and picked you up and carried you off to be their pet. Would <i>you</i> like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;N&#8212;no,&#8221; Nancy had to confess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bunny won&#8217;t like it either, if you carry him home with you,&#8221; said Mother. &#8220;You children look like three big giants to <i>him</i>. And what will his poor little mummie do if she comes to look for her baby and can&#8217;t find him?&#8221;</p>

<p>So, though they were very sorry to say good-by to Baby Bunny, the children decided to send him back to his &#8220;mummie.&#8221; The funny little fellow was in such a hurry to get home he nearly turned a somersault, jumping out of Nancy&#8217;s arms. Hoppity-skip! Skippity-hop! Away he sped to his burrow.</p>

<p>But when they told Farmer Brown about the wild bunny, he said: &#8220;Well, now, if you like rabbits, I&#8217;ll take you where you can see plenty&#8212;tame ones, too. Come along with me, this afternoon. I&#8217;ve got to leave a load of hay up the road. We&#8217;ll visit the rabbits on the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>So after dinner David and Nancy and Little Sister Joy rode off in the wagon, with Farmer Brown and his load of hay. By and by they stopped at a little red house, with a big yard in front. Around the yard was a high fence. The children jumped down from the wagon and peeped through the fence. The yard was full of bunnies! Brown bunnies and gray bunnies and white bunnies were hopping over the grass, popping out of their rabbit holes in the ground, or sitting up, listening with their long ears and wobbling their funny little noses&#8212;&#8220;winking their noses,&#8221; as Little Sister Joy called it.</p>

<p>Then the Bunny Lady came out of the house. She wore a bright blue smock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you come to see my rabbits?&#8221; she called. &#8220;Come right in!&#8221; And she opened the gate.</p>

<p>Farmer Brown left the children with the Bunny Lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my rabbit farm,&#8221; said she. &#8220;I&#8217;ve kept rabbits ever since I was a little girl. I raise them now to sell. Lots of boys and girls like to own rabbits.&#8221;</p>

<p>She brought a pan full of lettuce and allowed her guests to feed the bunnies. They were so tame that they came and nibbled the lettuce leaves right out of the children&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>David and Nancy and Little Sister Joy told the Bunny Lady about the wild baby rabbit&#8212;how they had wanted to keep him, but were afraid he would be unhappy. They told her about picking blueberries too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blueberries!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;My! Don&#8217;t <i>I</i> love them! But I never have time to go picking berries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll come and see you again, and bring you some blueberries,&#8221; Nancy promised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you?&#8221; said the Bunny Lady. &#8220;Well, now, if you&#8217;ll bring me blueberries, I&#8217;ll give you each a bunny! Bunnies for blueberries. It&#8217;s a bargain.&#8221;</p>

<p>But before they could keep bunnies, they had to make ready a rabbit hutch for them to live in. Farmer Brown&#8217;s son Joe built the hutch. It was a beauty! It had its own little yard with a strong wire fence around it, so the bunnies could not get out, and Trixie could not get <i>in</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;And aren&#8217;t we glad we planted lettuce in our garden beds!&#8221; said David. He and Nancy and Little Sister Joy had their own little garden beds, and they were raising lettuce, radishes, carrots, and beets&#8212;good food for bunnies!</p>

<p>When all was ready, they visited the Bunny Lady again. They brought her three baskets full of blueberries. And she gave them each a fine young rabbit. David&#8217;s was brown.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to call him Peter,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to name mine Snowball,&#8221; said Nancy. &#8220;He looks just like one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Sister Joy had a white bunny too. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to name him Pinky-Winky,&#8221; she said, &#8220;&#8217;cause he has such <i>bee-oo-tiful</i> pink eyes, and he winks his nose all the time.&#8221;</p>

<h2>What About You?</h2>
<p>Did you like that story? What was your favorite part?</p>

<p>Who said they wanted to keep the baby bunny first? Was it a good idea?</p>

<p>What would have happened if the children kept the wild bunny?</p>

<p>Did the children obey Mother when she said to put the bunny down?</p>

<p>How did the children get something much better in the end?</p>

<p>What do tame rabbits need to keep them happy and safe?</p>

<p>How do wild rabbits live differently than tame rabbits?</p>

<p>What did Little Sister Joy name her pet?</p>

<hr class="minor" />
<p>In the story David, Nancy, and Little Sister Joy learned a lesson. Even though they thought their idea of keeping the wild bunny would be fun, they learned that it was better to listen to Mother. When they couldn&#8217;t have their own way, they didn&#8217;t complain, did they? They were happy that they had seen the baby rabbit and had gotten to pet it. And later they had something much better than what they had first wanted. God is like that. If He says that we can&#8217;t have something, we must remember that He has something better for us. Don&#8217;t you want to wait for what is best?</p>

<p>[In &#8220;<a href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_10/Letter_to_a_Little_Princess/index.html">Letter to a Little Princess</a>&#8221; there are some paperdoll clothes for Joy with her tame bunny rabbit.]</p>

<h1>Something You Can Do</h1>

<p>Aren&#8217;t snowflakes beautiful? In the wintertime when it gets dark in the evenings you can put up paper snowflakes on the windows. God made every snowflake different, but each one has six points. Isn&#8217;t that amazing? This is a pattern that will make a six-pointed snowflake if you follow the directions carefully. There is also a pattern for an angel string, which you can tape on your window or shelf edge.</p>

<h2>Make a Paper Snowflake</h2>
<ol>
<li>Each snowflake is made out of a white piece of <b>square</b> paper. To make your paper square, fold the edges to meet like this and cut off the gray part:</li>

<li>Fold on the dotted lines.</li>

<li>Now turn your little paper square like this with the cut edges of the paper on top:</li>

<li>Fold in thirds on the dotted lines to make a cone shape. This is hard, so you might need help.</li>

<li>Next cut off the gray part in a slant (picture below). If you don&#8217;t cut off enough, some of the snowflake points will be shorter than others.</li>

<li>This is the time to cut the pattern. Always leave some paper on each side when you make cuts. If you leave only thin strips of paper, your snowflake will be more lacey. Have fun, and remember, each snowflake is different.</li>

<li>Finally, open your snowflake and tape it up! If it is in two pieces you need to follow step 3 more carefully.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Make an Angel Chain</h2>
<div class="left"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_10/chain_paper.jpg" alt="" width="75" height="165" /></div>
<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_10/chain_pattern.jpg" alt="" width="50" height="130" /></div>
<ol>
<li>For a long chain you will need a long piece of paper, like the connected kind of computer paper. To begin, carefully fold it back and forth, keeping the edges straight, like an accordian. Small folds will make small angels and big folds will make big ones.</li>

<li>Next copy this pattern (or something like it) on your folded paper stack. The wings need to touch the side of the paper so that the angels will stay together.</li>

<li>Open the chain up and see what it looks like. Can you think of some Bible stories about angels?</li>

<h1>Let Me Tell You&#8230;&#8203;</h1>

<p class="noindent">Dear [your name],</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t you like to run and tell Mom and Dad when something exciting has happened to you? How about sharing something with us? It doesn&#8217;t have to be long, just how God answered your prayer, or how when you waited He gave you something better than you asked. You can tell about the beautiful things God has made or how you learned to forgive. And about the time you asked Jesus to help you, and He did.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t you like getting letters? So do we! Why don&#8217;t you write one telling the rest of us what <b>you</b> have been learning today. God is so very good, isn&#8217;t He?</p>

<h1>Good Reading</h1>

<p>Have you had problems with forgiving someone who has done something mean to you? Do you like stories about children who are just like you? <i>Treasures of the Snow,</i> by Patricia St. John, is a book that your family may like to read together. It tells the story of a girl and boy who learn how wonderful it is to walk in God&#8217;s light instead of their own hatred and bitterness.</p>

<h1>On Your Guard</h1>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_10/guard_breastplate.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="269" /></div>
<p class="noindent">Dear Young Soldier:</p>

<p>Do you want to be in My army and fight as My soldier? Then you must wear the armor that I have for you. Do you want to keep your heart protected from wrong? Then you must wear the Breastplate of Righteousness.</p>

<p>These may seem like long, hard words, but I will explain them to you. First, a breastplate is a shield of armor that you strap on your chest. If anything comes along to get you, your heart will be safe with a breastplate to cover it.</p>

<p>Righteousness means living by what is right. All My ways that I have written in the Bible are right. All things right are good and make you happy if you follow them. That is how righteousness will keep you from wrong. If you do only what is right, then you won&#8217;t do what is wrong and your heart won&#8217;t be hurt.</p>

<p>My ways are right and I tell them to you because I love you. I tell you to obey your parents because they are there to take care of you. I tell you always to tell the truth because lies will hurt you and others. I tell you to treat others kindly, because that is when you will be blessed. If you think that what I tell you is too hard or not fun, remember that I am protecting you.</p>

<h1>No TV?</h1>

<p>As long as Billy could remember, he had watched Pokemon every Saturday after breakfast. But this morning, there was no television. It was gone. Billy could see where the television had been, but it was not there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did somebody steal our TV?&#8221; Billy asked his Mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Mother in a quiet voice.</p>

<p>Billy remembered when a man had come and taken the television away. It was gone almost two weeks, and Billy had gone over to Johnny&#8217;s house to watch Pokemon. Maybe the TV had broken again. &#8220;Can I go over to Johnny&#8217;s house?&#8221; Billy asked.</p>

<p>Mother was shaking her head slowly. &#8220;No, not this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll miss Pokemon!&#8221; Billy cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Mother.</p>

<p>Daddy was shaving in the bathroom. His face was covered with fluffy suds and he was scraping it with a razor. Billy liked to watch, but today it was time for Pokemon, and Mother wouldn&#8217;t let him go to Johnny&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Daddy,&#8221; Billy said. &#8220;I want to go to Johnny&#8217;s right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Daddy stopped shaving with half of his face still covered with white suds. He put down his razor and looked at Billy. &#8220;It&#8217;s time for Pokemon, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he said, in his deep, Daddy voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Billy said. He was glad that Daddy understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy,&#8221; Daddy said, &#8220;last night I cried.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy felt really strange. Daddy never cried, not even when a big tree branch had fallen on his arm and broke it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cried because I had made Jesus feel bad,&#8221; Daddy said slowly. &#8220;I had been doing things that Jesus did not want me to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy knew what that meant. He had done wrong things, too. &#8220;Were you sorry?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I was&#8212;so <i>very</i> sorry.&#8221; Billy was surprised to see tears shining in Daddy&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;Billy,&#8221; Daddy said, looking straight at him, &#8220;I have watched things on the TV that Jesus did not want me to watch. And, Billy,&#8221; Daddy continued, &#8220;I have let you watch things that Jesus did not want you to watch.&#8221; Then he said softly, &#8220;I told Jesus I was sorry. And Jesus forgave me.&#8221; Daddy smiled, but his eyes looked determined when he said, &#8220;By the Lord&#8217;s help, I won&#8217;t do it anymore.&#8221;</p>

<p>A lot of things were different around Billy&#8217;s home after that. Before they ate their food together, the family would pray and thank the Lord. Daddy read a Bible story every evening, and then they would have prayer. And Mother and Daddy didn&#8217;t yell at each other any more. Instead they prayed and sang. Mother sang while she did the dishes, and Daddy sang as he worked in the yard.</p>

<p>Daddy showed Billy how to saw boards to make a bird feeder. After they cut the pieces out, they screwed them together. They were just hanging the feeder up by the window when Johnny came over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boy, you should have seen what happened on Pokemon today,&#8221; Johnny said.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_10/tv_birdfeeder.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="222" /></div>
<p>&#8220;Look at this bird feeder,&#8221; Billy said. &#8220;I cut it out all by myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I pour the birdseed?&#8221; asked Johnny. He touched the tan wood with his fingertips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to know what happened on Pokemon today?&#8221; Johnny asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Billy said, &#8220;Pokemon isn&#8217;t real. I like real things that are good.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Letter to a Little Princess</h1>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_10/letter_doll.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="172" /></div>
<p class="noindent">Dear Princess,</p>

<p>Are you ready for a story about Princess Precious? One day Mother gave Princess Precious a baby doll, named Charlotte, for her birthday. Precious was very happy. Charlotte had big blue eyes that opened and closed. Precious could really give her a bottle of pretend milk. Precious was sure that Charlotte was the best doll in the world!</p>

<p>You would think that with such a nice doll, Precious would be very, very happy. And she was. Except one day, a little imp shot an arrow of discontent in Precious&#8217; heart. Precious didn&#8217;t go to King Jesus and have Him take the arrow out right away&#8212;she was too busy playing with Charlotte. But soon, Precious wasn&#8217;t so happy playing. She began to wish that Charlotte could drink real milk and would cry like a real baby. Soon, Precious thought sadly, &#8220;A baby doll isn&#8217;t really that nice. I wish my baby would come alive.&#8221;</p>

<div class="right"><img src="../../Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_10/letter_praying.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="372" /></div>
<p>Then Precious remembered that King Jesus had said that if anyone would ask something of Him, He would give what they wanted. Precious dropped on her knees and prayed, asking King Jesus to make her baby doll come alive. But Charlotte did not move. Princess Precious asked again and again, but King Jesus did not answer. Big tears splashed down from Precious&#8217; face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what is wrong, Princess Precious?&#8221; Mother Matron asked, coming into the room. Precious sobbed out the whole story about Charlotte and how King Jesus did not answer.</p>

<p>Mother was quiet, and then she said, &#8220;Did you know that sometimes King Jesus does not always give us what we want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked Precious, &#8220;He said that He would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Mother Matron kindly, &#8220;He said He would give us what is best, not what we always want. King Jesus did not make Charlotte come alive because it would not be best for you. See, Precious, you have to go to school, and you do not have time to take care of a baby. Real babies cry and need to be taken care of all the time. It is best that Charlotte stays a doll.&#8221;</p>

<p>Princess Precious&#8217; eyes opened wide. What if King Jesus had answered her prayer and she couldn&#8217;t go to school or play outside, but always take care of a real baby? Suddenly, Precious was glad that King Jesus only answers prayers that are best for us.</p>

<h1>Dear Reader</h1>

<p>The Lord is faithful and good, and as we wait and look to Him we learn more of our smallness and His greatness. We thank Him that He is able, for every need and every person. He has all the supplies and owns the cattle on a thousand hills. We praise Him for His care and help to us, and pray that this issue will be a blessing to you. Thank you to all who have written. It has been an encouragement to keep pressing on.</p>

<p>For any of you who are new to the paper, <i>Treasures of the Kingdom</i> is designed for boys and girls ages five to ten. If you have questions or want to share a testimony, please write. If you are interested in something for older children and adults, we also have available a quarterly magazine, <i>Foundation Truth</i>.</p>

<p>We are a Bible-believing family that belongs to the church God built, as described in the New Testament. Our family includes Rick and Krista Erickson and their five children: Laura (20), Skye (19), Joel (18), Kara (15), and Amanda (7). We live on a small acreage and are home educated. The publishing of <i>Treasures of the Kingdom</i> is mainly done by Laura and Joel, with help from others, including contributions from our friends, the Spinks family, and guidance by our parents.</p>
