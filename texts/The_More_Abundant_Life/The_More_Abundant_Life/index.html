<h1>The More Abundant Life</h1>

<p class="verse">Feed thou, today, upon the holy Book;
<br />Be strong to conquer &#8217;mid the raging strife;
<br />Help other struggling souls to win today,
<br />For thou shalt never pass again this way.</p>

<p class="verse">Feed thou, today, upon the holy Book;
<br />Be strong to make thy path without a crook;
<br />Lend thou a hand to others lest they stray,
<br />For thou shalt never pass again this way.</p>

<p class="verse">O soul of mine, be ever wide awake;
<br />Do all within thy power, for Jesus&#8217; sake,
<br />To feed some hungry, fainting soul today,
<br />For thou shalt never pass again this way.</p>

<p><span class="scripture">&#8220;I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+10%3A10" title="John 10:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 10:10)</span></a></span></p>

<p>These words of Jesus furnish the foundation on which this booklet is builded.
The great Judge of all men had passed the sentence of death upon all the race of man (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+5%3A12">Romans 5:12</a>).
Jesus came to revoke this death sentence and to give life unto men. He says to all,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on Him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation. but is passed from death unto life.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+5%3A24" title="John 5:24"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 5:24)</span></a></span>
Passing from death unto life is a wonderful experience, but millions of earth have experienced it. Nature furnishes many an illustration of this marvelous transition. We see it all around us in the springtime. We behold it when we see the caterpillar pass from its coma state in the cocoon into the butterfly life. This experience Jesus calls, being
<span class="scripture">&#8220;born again.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+3%3A7" title="John 3:7"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 3:7)</span></a></span>
An angel speaking to the virgin Mary said,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Thou shalt bring forth a Son, and shalt call His name Jesus.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Luke+1%3A31" title="Luke 1:31"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Luke 1:31)</span></a></span>
He told her that the Holy Spirit should come upon her, and the power of the Highest should overshadow her and Christ should be born of her. She willingly yielded her life to this wonderful and miraculous work. The Holy Spirit took the seed of God and brought it in contact with the seed of the woman and Christ was born of her. All men are highly favored of God. He will send the Holy Spirit to everyone, and for all those who will yield their will and life to Him, the Holy Spirit will bring their spirit in contact with the Spirit of God and Christ will be formed in them. Certainly it is a marvelous experience, but it is the way and only way to get into possession of that life that Jesus came to give. This is the all-important event in the life of man. Except we be born of the Spirit it would be far better had we never been born of the flesh.</p>

<p>In the words of our foundation text, Jesus teaches, not only that man can have life, but also that he can have it more abundantly. By this He means that there is to be a constant development of this life. When man receives this life, if it is allowed to develop according to its nature, he will daily grow up into the more abundant life. To aid saints to grow into more abundant life as the days come and go, is the message of this little book. May God bless it to that end. Our spirit must be brought into contact with the Spirit of God that we might have life. This is what constitutes a Christian. Our spirit must be kept in close contact with God&#8217;s Spirit that we may retain this life. There needs be as constant a flow of the life of God through Christ into our soul that we may live and grow as the branch has of the life of the vine. Jesus is the uniting link between God and man. He touches God on the one hand, and man on the other, and in and through Him we are kept in adjustment with God. In Christ we are made new creatures; we have a new life, and have a fresh start in humanity. Christianity is not a cold, staid, formal, and exact exterior, but an inward life. The external, by culture, may be brought into quite a degree of perfection, but this will only be delusive except it flows joyously from the perfect life of Christ in the soul. We may be very zealous for the cause of God, and this zeal may serve as a cloak to hide the coldness of the inward life. God wants the worker more than the work. He wants our love more than our labor, our hearts rather than our hands. His kingdom is advanced far more by what we <i>are</i> than by what we <i>do</i>. We may <i>do</i> ever so much, but if our doing is not the outflowing of the cheering, joyous, hopeful life of Christ at the center of the heart, our work will be destructive instead of constructive. If we would reproduce the life of Christ in our life, the interior spiritual union with God must be sustained and intensified in our souls.</p>

<p>Those who walk close with God tell us that there is a woeful lack of spiritual power among the people of God today. They say that there are but few who enter into that spirit of prayer that filled the life of Jesus in those early morning hours when praying in that solitary place. They tell us, however, that there are a few rare souls that are panting after God, and who are lifted up, by grace, into the atmosphere of a sincere, devout life. There are those who know how to leave all earthly things behind and in the Spirit find heavenly sweetness in a quiet hour with God. These are earth&#8217;s choicest jewels upon which God has set His love. These are the souls that make God their first end, and their service to God their second end, and because of this they keep themselves unwearied and unworried in their service. They seek to <i>be</i> good more than <i>do</i> good, for they know except they be good their <i>doing</i> is not as good as it should be. These are the souls that go apart from the world and in the solemn hush of prayer fill their souls with God and then every act of their service is fragrant with His presence.</p>

<p>All life was created with an end in view. God has garnered in every seed hidden principles of life which will develop after its kind. There are forces in all life which struggle to bring that life to its designed end. There is power in life. It is a mistake to seek after power. It exposes the soul to deception. Seek after life. The measure of your spiritual life is the measure of your spiritual power. Where there is little life there is little power. If you do not have power with God in prayer, if you can not lift your soul up into the presence of God and commune with Him in closest intimacy, you are wanting in spiritual life. Something has hindered the development of those life-forces born into your soul at regeneration. If you are not living a victorious life amid the annoyances and provocations of everyday life, you need more of that abundant life which Jesus came to give. You are allowing something to prevent the principle of life developing after its kind. There is a block somewhere. The contact with God is broken at some point; the channel is clogged somewhere. Maybe there has entered your soul an inclination to go after earthly things. Maybe you are adorning the body for its sake; or maybe you get worried and fretted by some of earth&#8217;s losses, or seek enjoyment from the creature rather than the Creator. 0 soul, flee earthly things, and lay hold on eternal life.</p>

<p>A seed is sown into the ground. It springs into life. There are forces in that life that push it upward through the crust of earth. Every day it is on its march toward the end for which it was created. Those life principles bear it onward and upward instinctively to its designed end. It rises into the stalk, the blade, the tassel, and the full ear. The soul in which has been born the life of Christ contains those principles and forces that struggle for growth and development. They are ever reaching up and taking hold on that which will bring them to maturity. Life links itself with life. The soul that has the life of Christ is linked with Christ and longs to rise to the fulness of Him. That life in the egg shell has power to burst open the door of its prison house and come forth to a higher state of existence. The soul in which has sprung up the life that Jesus came to give is imprisoned here in the body of flesh. While here, it is ever struggling for that higher liberty for which its life calls. Heavenly life in the soul is not reaching out after earthly things; it is ever reaching out after that which will carry it on to the fulness of its type which is Jesus. That soul is not spending much time, nor is it so greatly interested in its
<span class="scripture">&#8220;earthly house.&#8221;</span>
It groans and longs for that
<span class="scripture">&#8220;house which is from heaven.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Corinthians+5%3A1-2" title="II&nbsp;Corinthians 5:1-2"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Corinthians 5:1-2)</span></a></span>
There is a glorious liberty awaiting the children of God (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Romans+8%3A21">Romans 8:21</a>).
It is that liberty the soul will have when it lays aside this mortal body to be clothed with an immortal body&#8212;when this vile body shall be changed and
<span class="scripture">&#8220;fashioned like unto His glorious body.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+3%3A21" title="Philippians 3:21"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 3:21)</span></a></span>
</p>

<p>
O child of God, make sure that you have left all earthly things behind, and are reaching forth to those things that are before; that you are pressing toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+3%3A13-14">Philippians 3:13-14</a>).
That
<span class="scripture">&#8220;high calling of God&#8221;</span>
is the call to that glorious body in which you will not be seeing through a glass darkly, and shall know even as you are known. Give diligent heed to the culture of your life. See that you are rising higher every day into more abundant life. Beware lest you admit something into your life that would hinder the growth of your spiritual life. Give full liberty to those principles and forces of eternal life in your soul, that they be not hindered in their reaching out after God. 
Give full freedom to the Holy Spirit to work around in your heart producing in you that which is well pleasing in God&#8217;s sight (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Hebrews+13%3A21">Hebrews 13:21</a>).
See that your spirit is ever the throne-room of God, and that you enter often into that innermost seclusion and fertilize your spiritual life by His virtues. If you would be constantly growing up into more abundant life, you must hide your life with Christ in God. You must dwell with the Most High in that secret place where the voices of the world cannot disturb the sweet, solemn hush of your soul&#8217;s communion with eternal things, and where there is such a sacred calm that you can hear the whisperings of the Holy Spirit as He is instilling every thought and desire into your life. O man of God, flee earthly things; go often into that solitary place and sup in holy communion with the gentle Lover of your soul.</p>

<p>Jesus speaks of four things which, if the Christian would rise higher into that more abundant life, must be daily practiced.</p>
