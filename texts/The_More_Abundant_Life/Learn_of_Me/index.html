<p>The second word that Jesus gives by way of inviting us on to more abundant life is</p>

<h1>&#8220;Learn of Me&#8221;</h1>

<p>
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Take my yoke upon you, and learn of <i>me</i>.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+11%3A29" title="Matthew 11:29"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 11:29)</span></a></span>
To come unto Christ is not merely to come near Him, or into His presence, but to come <i>into</i> Him&#8212;into His heart. To &#8220;learn&#8221; of Him is not to learn <i>about</i> Him, or <i>from</i> Him, but to learn Him. In speaking of the sad state of the Gentiles the apostle in writing to the saints at Ephesus said,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;But ye have not so learned Christ.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Ephesians+4%3A20" title="Ephesians 4:20"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Ephesians 4:20)</span></a></span>
Those who are well acquainted with the oldest Greek manuscripts say that words &#8220;not so&#8221; are not found in this sentence; it would therefore read, &#8220;But ye have learned Christ.&#8221; This gives better sense to the reading. Learning Christ changes things. The better we learn Him the more we are changed. Those who learn Him do not walk as do the Gentiles.</p>

<p>The exhortation of Peter to Christians is to
<span class="scripture">&#8220;grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=2+Peter+3%3A18" title="II&nbsp;Peter 3:18"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (II&nbsp;Peter 3:18)</span></a></span>
This is the way up into the more abundant life. To be a strong, vigorous saint there needs to be a constant learning of Christ. We must ever be knowing Him better. To the soul that values its spiritual life, this is worth more than all else in the world. Paul says,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Philippians+3%3A8" title="Philippians 3:8"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Philippians 3:8)</span></a></span>
We shall have occasion to refer to this text later.</p>

<p>
To learn Christ is not to have Him revealed <i>to</i> us, but <i>in</i> us (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Galatians+1%3A16">Galatians 1:16</a>).
No one can learn another any thing of Christ. We may teach each other, but we can not learn each other. Every one must learn Him for themselves. You must put your mind and heart in such a prayerful, spiritual, receptive attitude toward God that the Holy Spirit can come and reveal Christ to you in the secret depths of your soul.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;There is a blest pavilion,
<br />A sacred inner court,
<br />The place of God&#8217;s own dwelling,
<br />With all the world shut out.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;Oh, sweet and tranquil home
<br />Where only God is known.&#8221;</p>

<p>God can make Himself known to us only in the &#8220;inner court&#8221; of our own spirit. It is there and there only that the Holy Spirit can give you a sense of Christ&#8217;s purity; it is only there the you can have sweet tastes of His love; it is only there that you can behold His glory. 0 soul, it is there and only there that you can truly know Him;
and to know Him is life eternal (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+17%3A3">John 17:3</a>).
</p>

<p>A sister gives this testimony of her experiences as she sat holding the hand of a dying saint. She says, &#8220;As her happy spirit took its flight, there came a sense of God&#8217;s glory and of His pleasure in the death of this saint, into my soul that I cannot describe. For several days I was constantly sensible of the presence of heavenly beings; and it seemed that the veil that divided me from them was exceedingly thin. I seemed to hear in my soul the songs of an innumerable company of angels as they welcomed this happy saint into her eternal home.&#8221; This sister, in this experience, learned Christ as He cannot be learned in the seminary, the college, or by correspondence courses. It is not our purpose to discuss the advantages and the disadvantages of these different channels of teaching Christ and His Word, only to say that the general tenor of the Scripture tells us that it is the tendency of these courses to hide Christ from the soul. Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, but he must needs get to the backside of the desert to know God. Paul was schooled at the feet of Gamaliel, but he needs spend three years in the desert of Arabia to learn Christ. It is only when the Spirit of the living God imprints Him on the fleshly table of our heart that we can know Him.</p>

<p>Let us study the words,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;Take my yoke upon you.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Matthew+11%3A29" title="Matthew 11:29"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Matthew 11:29)</span></a></span>
Jesus tells us that this is the way we can learn of Him. You can learn what Jesus is&#8212;learn His nature, His character&#8212;only by taking His yoke upon you. You can be told and you can read in the Bible that
<span class="scripture">&#8220;God is love,&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=1+John+4%3A16" title="I&nbsp;John 4:16"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (I&nbsp;John 4:16)</span></a></span>
but you can know this for yourself only by taking Christ&#8217;s yoke upon you. Then, what does it mean to take this yoke upon us? It means yokeship, and yokeship means fellowship. It means that we are to have a like nature or life with Him so that we can be fitly joined with Him, and pull with Him in all His interests. It means to work for Christ and with Christ in the extension of His interests in this present world. Do you grasp the thought? You can learn Christ only as you pull with Him. You yoke up with Jesus and pull with Him in His great work of saving souls, of healing the sick, of helping the poor, of spreading the Gospel, and leading the saints on to more abundant life, and you will learn more of Jesus in one day than you could ever learn in theological courses. When a company of people are yoked with Christ, and all pulling with Him, they are all pulling together. This is the Church of God. Every member in the Church of God is yoked with Christ and they are pulling together with Him, and pulling together in His ways. When one or a few begin to pull their way, then there is trouble and confusion. There is scarcely any project of any importance but has some organized system of association to further its interests. Now Jesus has organized His Church for the purpose of furthering His interests in the world among men. Please make a note of this. To learn Christ is to learn what are His interests, and to work heart and soul with Him in their extension. As we learn more of Him we learn better how to serve Him.</p>

<p class="verse">&#8220;I am learning how to serve Him,
<br />With my hands, my heart, my feet,
<br />And each day my Master&#8217;s service,
<br />To my soul becomes more sweet.&#8221;</p>

<p>When we enter the Church of God we leave self-interests on the outside and then shut the door. There is no living to self in the Church of God. It is all for Christ. We no longer live unto ourselves, but unto Him who died for us. He died for us; we live for Him.</p>

<p>The devil has been allowed to set up his kingdom in the earth, and he has a great many interests. He has many who are working in his interests. And a surprising thing is that many are working in his interest when they fancy that they are working in the interest of Jesus Christ. They think they are working in the interest of Christ and at the same time endeavoring to have God&#8217;s people to distrust Christ.</p>

<p>Most everyone has an interest in something. The sole interest of the saint is to further the interests of Jesus. They live to this end. This is their meat and drink. The deeper their interest the harder they work. The truly devoted saint goes to bed thinking and praying how he can advance the cause of God. He awakes in the morning with the same thought in his mind and prayer in his soul. This is what makes for more abundant life. When you thus live for Jesus you will taste a glory the world knows not of, and a divine glory will shine forth out of your life that can be found no where else in all the world. When you get to living in the interest of Jesus with all your soul, you have found heaven on earth. Show me a man who lives in word, thought, and deed for one day in the interest of Christ, and I will show you a man who can teach others the right ways of God more perfectly than all the doctors of divinity.</p>

<p>It would require a large volume to express all the thoughts given us on this subject of learning Jesus, but we must soon conclude this part of our booklet. However before we leave this subject let us take one trait in the nature of Christ and give it a brief study. It is His separation from the world. He makes the positive declaration,
<span class="scripture">&#8220;I am not of this world.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+8%3A23" title="John 8:23"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 8:23)</span></a></span>
This is a very simple statement, but who comprehends the depth of its meaning? In what sense and to what extent was Christ not of this world? You will need to get into some solitary place, and in the hush of your soul get in the Spirit that you may have any considerable degree of conception of Christ&#8217;s separation from the world. You will just truly need to shut out every earthly thing from your mind and soul, and invite the Holy Spirit to come into your spirit and there give you light to behold the life of Jesus.
<span class="scripture">&#8220;The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=Proverbs+20%3A27" title="Proverbs 20:27"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (Proverbs 20:27)</span></a></span>
God by His Spirit needs come into your spirit and light the candle that you may see the nature of Christ. Multitudes of professed followers of Jesus are talking of Christ&#8217;s and the Christian&#8217;s separation from the world, yet they have but little knowledge of what it means. We might be able to tell you something of what it means, but unless the Spirit gives you understanding you will still be in ignorance.</p>

<p>God loved the world, and Jesus loved the world. This means the souls of men. Jesus never loved any material, earthly thing. He never loved money or anything that money could buy. He did have need, while doing His Father&#8217;s business in the body, of a few earthly things, but, oh, how few! Can you find anywhere in His conversation that implies any concern or any affection for any material thing? He had meat to eat that the world knew not of. His meat was to do His Father&#8217;s will. When He looked upon any earthly thing, He did not see that material object so much as He saw what it typified in the spiritual world. When man looks on earthly things and sees nothing of the unseen things which they are meant to represent, he is not into the precious secret of Christ&#8217;s separation from the world. When Jesus saw a vine and its branches, He saw the Church of God. When He saw a field of grain ripening for harvest, He saw the harvest of souls. When He saw the birds of the air, or the lilies of the field, He saw His heavenly Father&#8217;s care of His people. When He saw the water the woman came to draw, He saw the
<span class="scripture">&#8220;living water.&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+4%3A10" title="John 4:10"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 4:10)</span></a></span>
When He saw a flock of sheep, He thought of His own flock. When He saw a hen gathering her brood under her wings, He thought of gathering His people under His wing. His conversation and His life plainly show that He was concerned in the unseen things rather than the seen. If He had seen a man in a fine automobile, He would not have admired the automobile but thought of the chariot in which that man&#8217;s soul could ride to heaven. Alas, how prone man is to see the seen things!</p>

<p>We must close this subject, but let us close it with a
<span class="scripture">&#8220;hard saying,&#8221;</span>
and
<span class="scripture">&#8220;who can hear it?&#8221;<a class="scripture script_ref www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+6%3A60" title="John 6:60"><span class="noprint">*</span><span class="inprint inline"> (John 6:60)</span></a></span>
Jesus, in all His teaching, preaching, work of healing and going about doing good never took a single thought about any earthly compensation.
You as a follower are to be as separate from the world as He was from the world (<a class="scripture www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/search/?query=bible&amp;passage=John+17%3A14-16">John 17:14-16</a>).
He never took a single thought about the praise of men, nor of their criticisms. A mountain of gold dollars would not influence Him one iota from His path of duty. Instead of seeing the mountain of gold, He would see the riches of God&#8217;s grace. He never used banquets and sight-seeing trips as a drawing-card to His religious gatherings. Those who for their Bible teaching, whether it be by preaching, or correspondence, have any thought about compensation or make a charge, do not see Jesus in His separation from earthly things. Instead of seeing the glory of the material temple, He saw its destruction. Instead of admiring the world or anything in it, He saw its destruction, and admired only that which was to endure forever. Do not be hasty to condemn the above words, but go into your secret closet and with the door shut ask God to reveal to your soul Christ in His separation from the world. Since it is the poor that is to have the Gospel preached to them, how dare we make a charge? In your learning of Jesus, study His&#8217; prayer life, and seek to live in that same spirit of prayer. God&#8217;s people need more of a spirit of prayer. They need to walk in the atmosphere of prayer.</p>
