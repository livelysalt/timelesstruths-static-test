<h1>Chapter 18</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, <i>that</i> Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother&#8217;s name also <i>was</i> Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And he did <i>that which was</i> right in the sight of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, according to all that David his father did.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>He trusted in the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor <i>any</i> that were before him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>For he clave to the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, <i>and</i> departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> commanded Moses.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> was with him; <i>and</i> he prospered whithersoever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>He smote the Philistines, <i>even</i> unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which <i>was</i> the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, <i>that</i> Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And at the end of three years they took it: <i>even</i> in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that <i>is</i> the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor <i>by</i> the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Because they obeyed not the voice of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> their God, but transgressed his covenant, <i>and</i> all that Moses the servant of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> commanded, and would not hear <i>them</i>, nor do <i>them</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And Hezekiah gave <i>him</i> all the silver that was found in the house of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and in the treasures of the king&#8217;s house.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>At that time did Hezekiah cut off <i>the gold from</i> the doors of the temple of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and <i>from</i> the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which <i>is</i> in the highway of the fuller&#8217;s field.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which <i>was</i> over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence <i>is</i> this wherein thou trustest?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Thou sayest, (but <i>they are but</i> vain words,) <i>I have</i> counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, <i>even</i> upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so <i>is</i> Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>But if ye say unto me, We trust in the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> our God: <i>is</i> not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master&#8217;s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Am I now come up without the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> against this place to destroy it? The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand <i>it</i>: and talk not with us in the Jews&#8217; language in the ears of the people that <i>are</i> on the wall.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? <i>hath he</i> not <i>sent me</i> to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews&#8217; language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, saying, The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make <i>an agreement</i> with me by a present, and come out to me, and <i>then</i> eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> will deliver us.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>Where <i>are</i> the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where <i>are</i> the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>Who <i>are</i> they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king&#8217;s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which <i>was</i> over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with <i>their</i> clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.</li>
