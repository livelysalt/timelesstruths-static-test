<h1>Chapter 5</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Be not ye therefore partakers with them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>For ye were sometimes darkness, but now <i>are ye</i> light in the Lord: walk as children of light:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>(For the fruit of the Spirit <i>is</i> in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove <i>them</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord <i>is</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so <i>let</i> the wives <i>be</i> to their own husbands in every thing.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife <i>see</i> that she reverence <i>her</i> husband.</li>
