<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Grace <i>be</i> to you, and peace, from God our Father, and <i>from</i> the Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Blessed <i>be</i> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly <i>places</i> in Christ:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; <i>even</i> in him:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>In whom ye also <i>trusted</i>, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And what <i>is</i> the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set <i>him</i> at his own right hand in the heavenly <i>places</i>,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And hath put all <i>things</i> under his feet, and gave him <i>to be</i> the head over all <i>things</i> to the church,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.</li>
