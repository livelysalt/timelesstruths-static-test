<h1>Chapter 18</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass <i>after</i> many days, that the word of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And <i>there was</i> a sore famine in Samaria.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And Ahab called Obadiah, which <i>was</i> the governor of <i>his</i> house. (Now Obadiah feared the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> greatly:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>For it was <i>so</i>, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, <i>Art</i> thou that my lord Elijah?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And he answered him, I <i>am</i>: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah <i>is here</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span><i>As</i> the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, <i>He is</i> not <i>there</i>; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah <i>is here</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass, <i>as soon as</i> I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> shall carry thee whither I know not; and <i>so</i> when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> from my youth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, how I hid an hundred men of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD&#8217;S</span> prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah <i>is here</i>: and he shall slay me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And Elijah said, <i>As</i> the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, <i>Art</i> thou he that troubleth Israel?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father&#8217;s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and thou hast followed Baalim.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>Now therefore send, <i>and</i> gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel&#8217;s table.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> <i>be</i> God, follow him: but if Baal, <i>then</i> follow him. And the people answered him not a word.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Then said Elijah unto the people, I, <i>even</i> I only, remain a prophet of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>; but Baal&#8217;s prophets <i>are</i> four hundred and fifty men.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay <i>it</i> on wood, and put no fire <i>under</i>: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay <i>it</i> on wood, and put no fire <i>under</i>:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress <i>it</i> first; for ye <i>are</i> many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire <i>under</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed <i>it</i>, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But <i>there was</i> no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he <i>is</i> a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, <i>or</i> peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the <i>time</i> of the offering of the <i>evening</i> sacrifice, that <i>there was</i> neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> <i>that was</i> broken down.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid <i>him</i> on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour <i>it</i> on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>And he said, Do <i>it</i> the second time. And they did <i>it</i> the second time. And he said, Do <i>it</i> the third time. And they did <i>it</i> the third time.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass at <i>the time of</i> the offering of the <i>evening</i> sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou <i>art</i> God in Israel, and <i>that</i> I <i>am</i> thy servant, and <i>that</i> I have done all these things at thy word.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>Hear me, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, hear me, that this people may know that thou <i>art</i> the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> God, and <i>that</i> thou hast turned their heart back again.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>Then the fire of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that <i>was</i> in the trench.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span>And when all the people saw <i>it</i>, they fell on their faces: and they said, The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, he <i>is</i> the God; the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, he <i>is</i> the God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span>And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for <i>there is</i> a sound of abundance of rain.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span>So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span>And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, <i>There is</i> nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man&#8217;s hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare <i>thy chariot</i>, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">46&nbsp;</span>And the hand of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</li>
