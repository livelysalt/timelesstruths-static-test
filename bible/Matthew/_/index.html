<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>When Herod the king had heard <i>these things</i>, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And thou Bethlehem, <i>in</i> the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found <i>him</i>, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping <i>for</i> her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to <i>our</i> father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and <i>with</i> fire:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Whose fan <i>is</i> in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answering said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Suffer <i>it to be so</i> now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.</span> Then he suffered him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</li>

<h1>Chapter 26</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Ye know that after two days is <i>the feast of</i> the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill <i>him</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>But they said, Not on the feast <i>day</i>, lest there be an uproar among the people.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat <i>at meat</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>But when his disciples saw <i>it</i>, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose <i>is</i> this waste?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>When Jesus understood <i>it</i>, he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</span></li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did <i>it</i> for my burial.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, <i>there</i> shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And said <i>unto them</i>, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now the first <i>day</i> of the <i>feast of</i> unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And he said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And he answered and said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">He that dippeth <i>his</i> hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</span></li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Thou hast said.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed <i>it</i>, and brake <i>it</i>, and gave <i>it</i> to the disciples, and said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Take, eat; this is my body.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave <i>it</i> to them, saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Drink ye all of it;</span></li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>Peter answered and said unto him, Though all <i>men</i> shall be offended because of thee, <i>yet</i> will I never be offended.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>Jesus said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>Then saith he unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span>And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou <i>wilt</i>.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, <span class="KJV_Jesus">What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed <i>is</i> willing, but the flesh <i>is</i> weak.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span>He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span>And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span>And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span>Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Sleep on now, and take <i>your</i> rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">46&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">47&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">48&nbsp;</span>Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">49&nbsp;</span>And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">50&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Friend, wherefore art thou come?</span> Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">51&nbsp;</span>And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out <i>his</i> hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest&#8217;s, and smote off his ear.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">52&nbsp;</span>Then said Jesus unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">53&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</span></li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">55&nbsp;</span>In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">56&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.</span> Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">57&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And they that had laid hold on Jesus led <i>him</i> away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">58&nbsp;</span>But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest&#8217;s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">59&nbsp;</span>Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">60&nbsp;</span>But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, <i>yet</i> found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">61&nbsp;</span>And said, This <i>fellow</i> said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">62&nbsp;</span>And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what <i>is it which</i> these witness against thee?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">63&nbsp;</span>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">64&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">65&nbsp;</span>Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">66&nbsp;</span>What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">67&nbsp;</span>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote <i>him</i> with the palms of their hands,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">68&nbsp;</span>Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">69&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">71&nbsp;</span>And when he was gone out into the porch, another <i>maid</i> saw him, and said unto them that were there, This <i>fellow</i> was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">72&nbsp;</span>And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">73&nbsp;</span>And after a while came unto <i>him</i> they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art <i>one</i> of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">74&nbsp;</span>Then began he to curse and to swear, <i>saying</i>, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">75&nbsp;</span>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</li>

<h1>Chapter 27</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What <i>is that</i> to us? see thou <i>to that</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter&#8217;s field, to bury strangers in.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And gave them for the potter&#8217;s field, as the Lord appointed me.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Thou sayest.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now at <i>that</i> feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? <i>They</i> all say unto him, Let him be crucified.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but <i>that</i> rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed <i>his</i> hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye <i>to it</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Then answered all the people, and said, His blood <i>be</i> on us, and on our children.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered <i>him</i> to be crucified.</li>

<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band <i>of soldiers</i>.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put <i>it</i> upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>And sitting down they watched him there;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">48&nbsp;</span>And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled <i>it</i> with vinegar, and put <i>it</i> on a reed, and gave him to drink.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">49&nbsp;</span>The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">50&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">51&nbsp;</span>And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">52&nbsp;</span>And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">53&nbsp;</span>And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">54&nbsp;</span>Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">55&nbsp;</span>And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">56&nbsp;</span>Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee&#8217;s children.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">57&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus&#8217; disciple:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">58&nbsp;</span>He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">59&nbsp;</span>And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">60&nbsp;</span>And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">61&nbsp;</span>And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">62&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">63&nbsp;</span>Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">64&nbsp;</span>Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">65&nbsp;</span>Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make <i>it</i> as sure as ye can.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">66&nbsp;</span>So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.</li>

<h1>Chapter 28</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first <i>day</i> of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead <i>men</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">All hail.</span> And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Then said Jesus unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him <i>away</i> while we slept.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And if this come to the governor&#8217;s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, <i>even</i> unto the end of the world.</span> Amen.</li>
