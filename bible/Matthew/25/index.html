<h1>Chapter 25</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And five of them were wise, and five <i>were</i> foolish.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">They that <i>were</i> foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But the wise answered, saying, <i>Not so</i>; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For <i>the kingdom of heaven is</i> as a man travelling into a far country, <i>who</i> called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made <i>them</i> other five talents.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And likewise he that <i>had received</i> two, he also gained other two.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord&#8217;s money.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">His lord said unto him, Well done, <i>thou</i> good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, <i>there</i> thou hast <i>that is</i> thine.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">His lord answered and said unto him, <i>Thou</i> wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and <i>then</i> at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Take therefore the talent from him, and give <i>it</i> unto him which hath ten talents.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span><span class="KJV_Jesus">When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth <i>his</i> sheep from the goats:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed <i>thee</i>? or thirsty, and gave <i>thee</i> drink?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">When saw we thee a stranger, and took <i>thee</i> in? or naked, and clothed <i>thee</i>?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done <i>it</i> unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done <i>it</i> unto me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did <i>it</i> not to one of the least of these, ye did <i>it</i> not to me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">46&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</span></li>
