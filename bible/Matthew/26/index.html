<h1>Chapter 26</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Ye know that after two days is <i>the feast of</i> the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill <i>him</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>But they said, Not on the feast <i>day</i>, lest there be an uproar among the people.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat <i>at meat</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>But when his disciples saw <i>it</i>, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose <i>is</i> this waste?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>When Jesus understood <i>it</i>, he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did <i>it</i> for my burial.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, <i>there</i> shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And said <i>unto them</i>, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now the first <i>day</i> of the <i>feast of</i> unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And he said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And as they did eat, he said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And he answered and said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">He that dippeth <i>his</i> hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Thou hast said.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed <i>it</i>, and brake <i>it</i>, and gave <i>it</i> to the disciples, and said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Take, eat; this is my body.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave <i>it</i> to them, saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Drink ye all of it;</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father&#8217;s kingdom.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>Then saith Jesus unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>Peter answered and said unto him, Though all <i>men</i> shall be offended because of thee, <i>yet</i> will I never be offended.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>Jesus said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>Then saith he unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span>And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou <i>wilt</i>.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, <span class="KJV_Jesus">What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed <i>is</i> willing, but the flesh <i>is</i> weak.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span>He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span>And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span>And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span>Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Sleep on now, and take <i>your</i> rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">46&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">47&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">48&nbsp;</span>Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">49&nbsp;</span>And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">50&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Friend, wherefore art thou come?</span> Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">51&nbsp;</span>And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out <i>his</i> hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest&#8217;s, and smote off his ear.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">52&nbsp;</span>Then said Jesus unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">53&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">54&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">55&nbsp;</span>In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">56&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.</span> Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">57&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And they that had laid hold on Jesus led <i>him</i> away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">58&nbsp;</span>But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest&#8217;s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">59&nbsp;</span>Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">60&nbsp;</span>But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, <i>yet</i> found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">61&nbsp;</span>And said, This <i>fellow</i> said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">62&nbsp;</span>And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what <i>is it which</i> these witness against thee?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">63&nbsp;</span>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">64&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">65&nbsp;</span>Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">66&nbsp;</span>What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">67&nbsp;</span>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote <i>him</i> with the palms of their hands,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">68&nbsp;</span>Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">69&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">70&nbsp;</span>But he denied before <i>them</i> all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">71&nbsp;</span>And when he was gone out into the porch, another <i>maid</i> saw him, and said unto them that were there, This <i>fellow</i> was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">72&nbsp;</span>And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">73&nbsp;</span>And after a while came unto <i>him</i> they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art <i>one</i> of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">74&nbsp;</span>Then began he to curse and to swear, <i>saying</i>, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">75&nbsp;</span>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</li>
