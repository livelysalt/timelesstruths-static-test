<h1>Chapter 13</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Behold, a sower went forth to sow;</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And when he sowed, some <i>seeds</i> fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>He answered and said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For this people&#8217;s heart is waxed gross, and <i>their</i> ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with <i>their</i> eyes, and hear with <i>their</i> ears, and should understand with <i>their</i> heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But blessed <i>are</i> your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous <i>men</i> have desired to see <i>those things</i> which ye see, and have not seen <i>them</i>; and to hear <i>those things</i> which ye hear, and have not heard <i>them</i>.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth <i>it</i> not, then cometh the wicked <i>one</i>, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth <i>it</i>; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Another parable spake he unto them; <span class="KJV_Jesus">The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>He answered and said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked <i>one</i>;</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">46&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">47&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">48&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">49&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">50&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">51&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Have ye understood all these things?</span> They say unto him, Yea, Lord.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">52&nbsp;</span>Then said he unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Therefore every scribe <i>which is</i> instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man <i>that is</i> an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure <i>things</i> new and old.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">53&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And it came to pass, <i>that</i> when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">54&nbsp;</span>And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this <i>man</i> this wisdom, and <i>these</i> mighty works?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">55&nbsp;</span>Is not this the carpenter&#8217;s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">56&nbsp;</span>And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this <i>man</i> all these things?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">57&nbsp;</span>And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">58&nbsp;</span>And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</li>
</ul>
