<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>A wise <i>man</i> will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>The fear of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> <i>is</i> the beginning of knowledge: <i>but</i> fools despise wisdom and instruction.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>For they <i>shall be</i> an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And they lay wait for their <i>own</i> blood; they lurk privily for their <i>own</i> lives.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>So <i>are</i> the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; <i>which</i> taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, <i>saying</i>,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</li>

<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, <i>and</i> apply thine heart to understanding;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, <i>and</i> liftest up thy voice for understanding;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as <i>for</i> hid treasures;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Then shalt thou understand the fear of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and find the knowledge of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>For the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> giveth wisdom: out of his mouth <i>cometh</i> knowledge and understanding.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: <i>he is</i> a buckler to them that walk uprightly.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; <i>yea</i>, every good path.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>To deliver thee from the way of the evil <i>man</i>, from the man that speaketh froward things;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Who rejoice to do evil, <i>and</i> delight in the frowardness of the wicked;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Whose ways <i>are</i> crooked, and <i>they</i> froward in their paths:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>To deliver thee from the strange woman, <i>even</i> from the stranger <i>which</i> flattereth with her words;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>That thou mayest walk in the way of good <i>men</i>, and keep the paths of the righteous.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.</li>

<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Trust in the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and depart from evil.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Honour the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>My son, despise not the chastening of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>; neither be weary of his correction:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>For whom the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son <i>in whom</i> he delighteth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Happy <i>is</i> the man <i>that</i> findeth wisdom, and the man <i>that</i> getteth understanding.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>For the merchandise of it <i>is</i> better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>She <i>is</i> more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Length of days <i>is</i> in her right hand; <i>and</i> in her left hand riches and honour.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Her ways <i>are</i> ways of pleasantness, and all her paths <i>are</i> peace.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>She <i>is</i> a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy <i>is every one</i> that retaineth her.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>For the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do <i>it</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>For the froward <i>is</i> abomination to the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>: but his secret <i>is</i> with the righteous.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>The curse of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> <i>is</i> in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.</li>

<h1>Chapter 4</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>For I was my father&#8217;s son, tender and only <i>beloved</i> in the sight of my mother.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Wisdom <i>is</i> the principal thing; <i>therefore</i> get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil <i>men</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause <i>some</i> to fall.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>But the path of the just <i>is</i> as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>The way of the wicked <i>is</i> as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>That thou mayest regard discretion, and <i>that</i> thy lips may keep knowledge.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>For the lips of a strange woman drop <i>as</i> an honeycomb, and her mouth <i>is</i> smoother than oil:</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span><i>Let her be as</i> the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</li>

<h1>Chapter 30</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, <i>even</i> the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Surely I <i>am</i> more brutish than <i>any</i> man, and have not the understanding of a man.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what <i>is</i> his name, and what <i>is</i> his son&#8217;s name, if thou canst tell?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Every word of God <i>is</i> pure: he <i>is</i> a shield unto them that put their trust in him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Two <i>things</i> have I required of thee; deny me <i>them</i> not before I die:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Lest I be full, and deny <i>thee</i>, and say, Who <i>is</i> the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God <i>in vain</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span><i>There is</i> a generation <i>that</i> curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span><i>There is</i> a generation <i>that are</i> pure in their own eyes, and <i>yet</i> is not washed from their filthiness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span><i>There is</i> a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span><i>There is</i> a generation, whose teeth <i>are as</i> swords, and their jaw teeth <i>as</i> knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from <i>among</i> men.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>The horseleach hath two daughters, <i>crying</i>, Give, give. There are three <i>things that</i> are never satisfied, <i>yea</i>, four <i>things</i> say not, <i>It is</i> enough:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>The grave; and the barren womb; the earth <i>that</i> is not filled with water; and the fire <i>that</i> saith not, <i>It is</i> enough.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>The eye <i>that</i> mocketh at <i>his</i> father, and despiseth to obey <i>his</i> mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>There be three <i>things which</i> are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Such <i>is</i> the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>For three <i>things</i> the earth is disquieted, and for four <i>which</i> it cannot bear:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>For an odious <i>woman</i> when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>There be four <i>things which are</i> little upon the earth, but they <i>are</i> exceeding wise:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>The ants <i>are</i> a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>The conies <i>are but</i> a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings&#8217; palaces.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>There be three <i>things</i> which go well, yea, four are comely in going:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>A lion <i>which is</i> strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom <i>there is</i> no rising up.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, <i>lay</i> thine hand upon thy mouth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>She perceiveth that her merchandise <i>is</i> good: her candle goeth not out by night.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household <i>are</i> clothed with scarlet.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Strength and honour <i>are</i> her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue <i>is</i> the law of kindness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband <i>also</i>, and he praiseth her.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>Favour <i>is</i> deceitful, and beauty <i>is</i> vain: <i>but</i> a woman <i>that</i> feareth the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, she shall be praised.</li>
