<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified <i>it</i> by his angel unto his servant John:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Blessed <i>is</i> he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time <i>is</i> at hand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace <i>be</i> unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And from Jesus Christ, <i>who is</i> the faithful witness, <i>and</i> the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him <i>be</i> glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they <i>also</i> which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending,</span> saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>I was in the Spirit on the Lord&#8217;s day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last:</span> and, <span class="KJV_Jesus">What thou seest, write in a book, and send <i>it</i> unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And in the midst of the seven candlesticks <i>one</i> like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>His head and <i>his</i> hairs <i>were</i> white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes <i>were</i> as a flame of fire;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance <i>was</i> as the sun shineth in his strength.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Fear not; I am the first and the last:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">I <i>am</i> he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.</span></li>

<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name&#8217;s sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Nevertheless I have <i>somewhat</i> against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and <i>I know</i> the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but <i>are</i> the synagogue of Satan.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast <i>some</i> of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, <i>even</i> where Satan&#8217;s seat <i>is</i>: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas <i>was</i> my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth <i>it</i>.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet <i>are</i> like fine brass;</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last <i>to be</i> more than the first.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But that which ye have <i>already</i> hold fast till I come.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And I will give him the morning star.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</span></li>

<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.</span></li>

<h1>Chapter 4</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>After this I looked, and, behold, a door <i>was</i> opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard <i>was</i> as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and <i>one</i> sat on the throne.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and <i>there was</i> a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And round about the throne <i>were</i> four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and <i>there were</i> seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And before the throne <i>there was</i> a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, <i>were</i> four beasts full of eyes before and behind.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And the first beast <i>was</i> like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast <i>was</i> like a flying eagle.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And the four beasts had each of them six wings about <i>him</i>; and <i>they were</i> full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.</li>

<h1>Chapter 5</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four <i>and</i> twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.</li>

<h1>Chapter 6</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And there went out another horse <i>that was</i> red: and <i>power</i> was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and <i>see</i> thou hurt not the oil and the wine.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.

<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they <i>were</i>, should be fulfilled.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:</li>

<h1>Chapter 17</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And upon her forehead <i>was</i> a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And here <i>is</i> the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, <i>and</i> the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him <i>are</i> called, and chosen, and faithful.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet <i>are</i>, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is <i>the book</i> of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.</li>

<h1>Chapter 21</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God <i>is</i> with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, <i>and be</i> their God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb&#8217;s wife.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Having the glory of God: and her light <i>was</i> like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And had a wall great and high, <i>and</i> had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are <i>the names</i> of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred <i>and</i> forty <i>and</i> four cubits, <i>according to</i> the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And the building of the wall of it was <i>of</i> jasper: and the city <i>was</i> pure gold, like unto clear glass.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And the foundations of the wall of the city <i>were</i> garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation <i>was</i> jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And the twelve gates <i>were</i> twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city <i>was</i> pure gold, as it were transparent glass.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb <i>is</i> the light thereof.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither <i>whatsoever</i> worketh abomination, or <i>maketh</i> a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb&#8217;s book of life.</li>

<h1>Chapter 22</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, <i>was there</i> the tree of life, which bare twelve <i>manner of</i> fruits, <i>and</i> yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree <i>were</i> for the healing of the nations.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And they shall see his face; and his name <i>shall be</i> in their foreheads.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And he said unto me, These sayings <i>are</i> faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Behold, I come quickly: blessed <i>is</i> he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And I John saw these things, and heard <i>them</i>. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Then saith he unto me, See <i>thou do it</i> not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward <i>is</i> with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Blessed <i>are</i> they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>For without <i>are</i> dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, <i>and</i> the bright and morning star.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and <i>from</i> the things which are written in this book.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>He which testifieth these things saith, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Surely I come quickly.</span> Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with you all. Amen.</li>
