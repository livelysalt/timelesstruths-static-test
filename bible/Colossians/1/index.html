<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus <i>our</i> brother,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace <i>be</i> unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love <i>which ye have</i> to all the saints,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Which is come unto you, as <i>it is</i> in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as <i>it doth</i> also in you, since the day ye heard <i>of it</i>, and knew the grace of God in truth:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>For this cause we also, since the day we heard <i>it</i>, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated <i>us</i> into the kingdom of his dear Son:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>In whom we have redemption through his blood, <i>even</i> the forgiveness of sins:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether <i>they be</i> thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all <i>things</i> he might have the preeminence.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>For it pleased <i>the Father</i> that in him should all fulness dwell;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, <i>I say</i>, whether <i>they be</i> things in earth, or things in heaven.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in <i>your</i> mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and <i>be</i> not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, <i>and</i> which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body&#8217;s sake, which is the church:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span><i>Even</i> the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>To whom God would make known what <i>is</i> the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.</li>
