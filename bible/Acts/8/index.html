<h1>Chapter 8</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And devout men carried Stephen <i>to his burial</i>, and made great lamentation over him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed <i>them</i> to prison.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed <i>with them</i>: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And there was great joy in that city.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Then laid they <i>their</i> hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles&#8217; hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and <i>in</i> the bond of iniquity.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>And Philip ran thither to <i>him</i>, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>And as they went on <i>their</i> way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, <i>here is</i> water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span>And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</li>
