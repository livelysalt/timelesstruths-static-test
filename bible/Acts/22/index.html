<h1>Chapter 22</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence <i>which I make</i> now unto you.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>I am verily a man <i>which am</i> a Jew, born in Tarsus, <i>a city</i> in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, <i>and</i> taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, <span class="KJV_Jesus">I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt <i>there</i>,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And saw him saying unto me, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And he said unto me, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And they gave him audience unto this word, and <i>then</i> lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a <i>fellow</i> from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And as they cried out, and cast off <i>their</i> clothes, and threw dust into the air,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>When the centurion heard <i>that</i>, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was <i>free</i> born.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from <i>his</i> bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.</li>
