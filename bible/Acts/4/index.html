<h1>Chapter 4</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And they laid hands on them, and put <i>them</i> in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, <i>even</i> by him doth this man stand here before you whole.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them <i>is</i> manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny <i>it</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all <i>men</i> glorified God for that which was done.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou <i>art</i> God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any <i>of them</i> that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>And laid <i>them</i> down at the apostles&#8217; feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, <i>and</i> of the country of Cyprus,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>Having land, sold <i>it</i>, and brought the money, and laid <i>it</i> at the apostles&#8217; feet.</li>
</ul>
