<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, <i>and</i> Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master&#8217;s crib: <i>but</i> Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>From the sole of the foot even unto the head <i>there is</i> no soundness in it; <i>but</i> wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Your country <i>is</i> desolate, your cities <i>are</i> burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and <i>it is</i> desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Except the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, <i>and</i> we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Hear the word of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>To what purpose <i>is</i> the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; <i>it is</i> iniquity, even the solemn meeting.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear <i>them</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Come now, and let us reason together, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath spoken <i>it</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>Thy princes <i>are</i> rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>Therefore saith the Lord, the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners <i>shall be</i> together, and they that forsake the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> shall be consumed.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench <i>them</i>.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass in the last days, <i>that</i> the mountain of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD&#8217;S</span> house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> from Jerusalem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and <i>are</i> soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither <i>is there any</i> end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither <i>is there any</i> end of their chariots:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and for the glory of his majesty.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>For the day of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts <i>shall be</i> upon every <i>one that is</i> proud and lofty, and upon every <i>one that is</i> lifted up; and he shall be brought low:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, <i>that are</i> high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And the idols he shall utterly abolish.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made <i>each one</i> for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.</li>

<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>For, behold, the Lord, the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings <i>are</i> against the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, to provoke the eyes of his glory.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide <i>it</i> not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</li>

<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, <i>is</i> the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts: the whole earth <i>is</i> full of his glory.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Then said I, Woe <i>is</i> me! for I am undone; because I <i>am</i> a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, <i>which</i> he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here <i>am</i> I; send me.</li>

<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, <i>that</i> Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Then said the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller&#8217;s field;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, <i>even</i> the son of Tabeal:</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>For the head of Syria <i>is</i> Damascus, and the head of Damascus <i>is</i> Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And the head of Ephraim <i>is</i> Samaria, and the head of Samaria <i>is</i> Remaliah&#8217;s son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, <i>that</i> the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> shall hiss for the fly that <i>is</i> in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that <i>is</i> in the land of Assyria.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, <i>namely</i>, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, <i>that</i> a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk <i>that</i> they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, <i>that</i> every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it shall <i>even</i> be for briers and thorns.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, <i>which</i> as a tempest of hail <i>and</i> a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under feet:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And the glorious beauty, which <i>is</i> on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower, <i>and</i> as the hasty fruit before the summer; which <i>when</i> he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>In that day shall the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble <i>in</i> judgment.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>For all tables are full of vomit <i>and</i> filthiness, <i>so that there is</i> no place <i>clean</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? <i>them that are</i> weaned from the milk, <i>and</i> drawn from the breasts.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>To whom he said, This <i>is</i> the rest <i>wherewith</i> ye may cause the weary to rest; and this <i>is</i> the refreshing: yet they would not hear.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>But the word of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, <i>and</i> there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Wherefore hear the word of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, ye scornful men, that rule this people which <i>is</i> in Jerusalem.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord G<span class="caps-s">OD</span>, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner <i>stone</i>, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord G<span class="caps-s">OD</span> of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>I say, <i>sayest thou</i>, (but <i>they are but</i> vain words) <i>I have</i> counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make <i>an agreement</i> with me <i>by</i> a present, and come out to me: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>It may be the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up <i>thy</i> prayer for the remnant that is left.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard <i>it</i>, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, <i>as</i> Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which <i>were</i> in Telassar?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Where <i>is</i> the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and spread it before the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And Hezekiah prayed unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, saying,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest <i>between</i> the cherubims, thou <i>art</i> the God, <i>even</i> thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Incline thine ear, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and hear; open thine eyes, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the living God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Of a truth, L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And have cast their gods into the fire: for they <i>were</i> no gods, but the work of men&#8217;s hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou <i>art</i> the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, <i>even</i> thou only.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>This <i>is</i> the word which the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, <i>and</i> laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted <i>thy</i> voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? <i>even</i> against the Holy One of Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, <i>and</i> the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, <i>and</i> the forest of his Carmel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>Hast thou not heard long ago, <i>how</i> I have done it; <i>and</i> of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities <i>into</i> ruinous heaps.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>Therefore their inhabitants <i>were</i> of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were <i>as</i> the grass of the field, and <i>as</i> the green herb, <i>as</i> the grass on the housetops, and <i>as corn</i> blasted before it be grown up.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>And this <i>shall be</i> a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat <i>this</i> year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts shall do this.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David&#8217;s sake.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>Then the angel of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they <i>were</i> all dead corpses.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.</li>

<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, <i>in whom</i> my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Thus saith God the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>I the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And when ye see <i>this</i>, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> shall be known toward his servants, and <i>his</i> indignation toward his enemies.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>For, behold, the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>For by fire and by his sword will the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> plead with all flesh: and the slain of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> shall be many.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one <i>tree</i> in the midst, eating swine&#8217;s flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>For I <i>know</i> their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, <i>to</i> Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, <i>to</i> Tubal, and Javan, <i>to</i> the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And they shall bring all your brethren <i>for</i> an offering unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And I will also take of them for priests <i>and</i> for Levites, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, so shall your seed and your name remain.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.</li>
