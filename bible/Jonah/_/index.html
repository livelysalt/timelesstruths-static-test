<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Now the word of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>But the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that <i>were</i> in the ship into the sea, to lighten <i>it</i> of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil <i>is</i> upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil <i>is</i> upon us; What <i>is</i> thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what <i>is</i> thy country? and of what people <i>art</i> thou?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, I <i>am</i> an Hebrew; and I fear the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry <i>land</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, because he had told them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest <i>is</i> upon you.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring <i>it</i> to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Wherefore they cried unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and said, We beseech thee, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man&#8217;s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, hast done as it pleased thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Then the men feared the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and made vows.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Now the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.</li>

<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Then Jonah prayed unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> his God out of the fish&#8217;s belly,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, <i>and</i> thou heardest my voice.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>The waters compassed me about, <i>even</i> to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars <i>was</i> about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> my God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>When my soul fainted within me I remembered the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay <i>that</i> that I have vowed. Salvation <i>is</i> of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry <i>land</i>.</li>

<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And the word of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> came unto Jonah the second time, saying,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days&#8217; journey.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And Jonah began to enter into the city a day&#8217;s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered <i>him</i> with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And he caused <i>it</i> to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that <i>is</i> in their hands.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Who can tell <i>if</i> God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did <i>it</i> not.</li>

<h1>Chapter 4</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And he prayed unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and said, I pray thee, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, <i>was</i> not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou <i>art</i> a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore now, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for <i>it is</i> better for me to die than to live.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Then said the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, Doest thou well to be angry?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> God prepared a gourd, and made <i>it</i> to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, <i>It is</i> better for me to die than to live.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, <i>even</i> unto death.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Then said the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and <i>also</i> much cattle?</li>
