<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And Judah went up; and the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered <i>their meat</i> under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before <i>was</i> Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before <i>was</i> Kirjathsepher:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb&#8217;s younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when she came <i>to him</i>, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off <i>her</i> ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the children of the Kenite, Moses&#8217; father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which <i>lieth</i> in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> was with Judah; and he drave out <i>the inhabitants of</i> the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> <i>was</i> with them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before <i>was</i> Luz.)</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which <i>is</i> the name thereof unto this day.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Neither did Manasseh drive out <i>the inhabitants of</i> Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>And the coast of the Amorites <i>was</i> from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.</li>

<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And an angel of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be <i>as thorns</i> in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when the angel of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And the people served the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, that he did for Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, died, <i>being</i> an hundred and ten years old.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and served Baalim:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And they forsook the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that <i>were</i> round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> to anger.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And they forsook the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And the anger of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> was against them for evil, as the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> had said, and as the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Nevertheless the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>; <i>but</i> they did not so.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And when the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> raised them up judges, then the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, <i>that</i> they returned, and corrupted <i>themselves</i> more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the anger of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> to walk therein, as their fathers did keep <i>it</i>, or not.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>Therefore the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.</li>

<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Now these <i>are</i> the nations which the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> left, to prove Israel by them, <i>even</i> as many <i>of Israel</i> as had not known all the wars of Canaan;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span><i>Namely</i>, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and forgat the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> their God, and served Baalim and the groves.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Therefore the anger of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And when the children of Israel cried unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, <i>even</i> Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb&#8217;s younger brother.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And the Spirit of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>: and the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>But when the children of Israel cried unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon <i>was</i> a very fat man.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>But he himself turned again from the quarries that <i>were</i> by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of <i>his</i> seat.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour <i>were</i> locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened <i>them</i>: and, behold, their lord <i>was</i> fallen down dead on the earth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.</li>

<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> God of Israel commanded, <i>saying</i>, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin&#8217;s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, <i>then</i> I will not go.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Now Heber the Kenite, <i>which was</i> of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which <i>is</i> by Kedesh.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, <i>even</i> nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that <i>were</i> with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.</li>

So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> discomfited Sisera, and all <i>his</i> chariots, and all <i>his</i> host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off <i>his</i> chariot, and fled away on his feet.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; <i>and</i> there was not a man left.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for <i>there was</i> peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Then Jael Heber&#8217;s wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her <i>tent</i>, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail <i>was</i> in his temples.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</li>

<h1>Chapter 7</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Then Jerubbaal, who <i>is</i> Gideon, and all the people that <i>were</i> with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> said unto Gideon, The people that <i>are</i> with thee <i>are</i> too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever <i>is</i> fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> said unto Gideon, The people <i>are</i> yet <i>too</i> many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, <i>that</i> of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>So he brought down the people unto the water: and the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And the number of them that lapped, <i>putting</i> their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the <i>other</i> people go every man unto his place.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all <i>the rest of</i> Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And it came to pass the same night, that the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that <i>were</i> in the host.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels <i>were</i> without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And when Gideon was come, behold, <i>there was</i> a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And his fellow answered and said, This <i>is</i> nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: <i>for</i> into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And it was <i>so</i>, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And he divided the three hundred men <i>into</i> three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man&#8217;s hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be <i>that</i>, as I do, so shall ye do.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that <i>are</i> with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, <i>The sword</i> of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and of Gideon.</li>

</ul>

<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him.</li>

<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> be witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> in Mizpeh.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight in my land?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those <i>lands</i> again peaceably.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken <i>thereto</i>.

<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon <i>was</i> the border of Moab.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>So now the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,</li>

<ul class="KJV">

<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and I cannot go back.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>And she said unto him, My father, <i>if</i> thou hast opened thy mouth unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, <i>even</i> of the children of Ammon.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put <i>them</i> upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that <i>is</i> before Hebron.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength <i>lieth</i>, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart.

<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And she said, The Philistines <i>be</i> upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> was departed from him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines <i>were</i> there; and <i>there were</i> upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>And Samson called unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and said, O Lord G<span class="caps-s">OD</span>, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines.

<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought <i>him</i> up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.</li>

<h1>Chapter 20</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> in Mizpeh.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And the chief of all the people, <i>even</i> of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell <i>us</i>, how was this wickedness?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that <i>belongeth</i> to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night, <i>and</i> thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Behold, ye <i>are</i> all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any <i>of us</i> go to his tent, neither will we any <i>of us</i> turn into his house.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>But now this <i>shall be</i> the thing which we will do to Gibeah; <i>we will go up</i> by lot against it;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness <i>is</i> this that is done among you?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Now therefore deliver <i>us</i> the men, the children of Belial, which <i>are</i> in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Among all this people <i>there were</i> seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair <i>breadth</i>, and not miss.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these <i>were</i> men of war.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> said, Judah <i>shall go up</i> first.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> until even, and asked counsel of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> said, Go up against him.)</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel enquired of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, (for the ark of the covenant of God <i>was</i> there in those days,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, <i>and</i> were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, <i>and</i> kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>And the children of Benjamin said, They <i>are</i> smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, <i>even</i> out of the meadows of Gibeah.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil <i>was</i> near them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew <i>themselves</i> along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span>And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite <i>and</i> kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as <i>in</i> the first battle.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span>And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span>Therefore they turned <i>their backs</i> before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which <i>came</i> out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span><i>Thus</i> they inclosed the Benjamites round about, <i>and</i> chased them, <i>and</i> trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span>And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these <i>were</i> men of valour.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span>And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">46&nbsp;</span>So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these <i>were</i> men of valour.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">47&nbsp;</span>But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">48&nbsp;</span>And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of <i>every</i> city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.</li>

<h1>Chapter 21</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And said, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel said, Who <i>is there</i> among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And they said, What one <i>is there</i> of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>For the people were numbered, and, behold, <i>there were</i> none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And this <i>is</i> the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which <i>is</i> in the land of Canaan.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And the whole congregation sent <i>some</i> to speak to the children of Benjamin that <i>were</i> in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And they said, <i>There must be</i> an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed <i>be</i> he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>Then they said, Behold, <i>there is</i> a feast of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> in Shiloh yearly <i>in a place</i> which <i>is</i> on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, <i>that</i> ye should be guilty.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And the children of Benjamin did so, and took <i>them</i> wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>In those days <i>there was</i> no king in Israel: every man did <i>that which was</i> right in his own eyes.</li>
