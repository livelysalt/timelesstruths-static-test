<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Now these <i>are</i> the nations which the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> left, to prove Israel by them, <i>even</i> as many <i>of Israel</i> as had not known all the wars of Canaan;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span><i>Namely</i>, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and forgat the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> their God, and served Baalim and the groves.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Therefore the anger of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And when the children of Israel cried unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, <i>even</i> Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb&#8217;s younger brother.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And the Spirit of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>: and the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>But when the children of Israel cried unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon <i>was</i> a very fat man.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>But he himself turned again from the quarries that <i>were</i> by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of <i>his</i> seat.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour <i>were</i> locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened <i>them</i>: and, behold, their lord <i>was</i> fallen down dead on the earth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.</li>
</ul>
