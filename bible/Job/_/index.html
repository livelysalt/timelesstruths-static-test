<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name <i>was</i> Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And his sons went and feasted <i>in their</i> houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And it was so, when the days of <i>their</i> feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings <i>according</i> to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and Satan came also among them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that <i>there is</i> none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Then Satan answered the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath <i>is</i> in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And there was a day when his sons and his daughters <i>were</i> eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother&#8217;s house:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And the Sabeans fell <i>upon them</i>, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>While he <i>was</i> yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>While he <i>was</i> yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>While he <i>was</i> yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters <i>were</i> eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother&#8217;s house:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And said, Naked came I out of my mother&#8217;s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> gave, and the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath taken away; blessed be the name of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</li>

<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that <i>there is</i> none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And Satan answered the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> said unto Satan, Behold, he <i>is</i> in thine hand; but save his life.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>So went Satan forth from the presence of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Now when Job&#8217;s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that <i>his</i> grief was very great.</li>

<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And Job spake, and said,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night <i>in which</i> it was said, There is a man child conceived.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>As <i>for</i> that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but <i>have</i> none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Because it shut not up the doors of my <i>mother&#8217;s</i> womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Why died I not from the womb? <i>why</i> did I <i>not</i> give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants <i>which</i> never saw light.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>There the wicked cease <i>from</i> troubling; and there the weary be at rest.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span><i>There</i> the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>The small and great are there; and the servant <i>is</i> free from his master.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter <i>in</i> soul;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Which long for death, but it <i>cometh</i> not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Which rejoice exceedingly, <i>and</i> are glad, when they can find the grave?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span><i>Why is light given</i> to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.</li>

<h1>Chapter 4</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span><i>If</i> we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span><i>Is</i> not <i>this</i> thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Remember, I pray thee, who <i>ever</i> perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion&#8217;s whelps are scattered abroad.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image <i>was</i> before mine eyes, <i>there was</i> silence, and I heard a voice, <i>saying</i>,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>How much less <i>in</i> them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation <i>is</i> in the dust, <i>which</i> are crushed before the moth?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding <i>it</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Doth not their excellency <i>which is</i> in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.</li>

<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither <i>is there</i> any to deliver <i>them</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform <i>their</i> enterprise.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle <i>shall be</i> in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Thou shalt know also that thy seed <i>shall be</i> great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Knowest thou <i>not</i> this of old, since man was placed upon earth,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>That the triumphing of the wicked <i>is</i> short, and the joy of the hypocrite <i>but</i> for a moment?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span><i>Yet</i> he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where <i>is</i> he?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span><i>Yet</i> his meat in his bowels is turned, <i>it is</i> the gall of asps within him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span><i>When</i> he is about to fill his belly, <i>God</i> shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain <i>it</i> upon him while he is eating.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>He shall flee from the iron weapon, <i>and</i> the bow of steel shall strike him through.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors <i>are</i> upon him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>All darkness <i>shall be</i> hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>The increase of his house shall depart, <i>and his goods</i> shall flow away in the day of his wrath.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>This <i>is</i> the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.</li>

<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Furthermore Elihu answered and said,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Hear my words, O ye wise <i>men</i>; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what <i>is</i> good.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Should I lie against my right? my wound <i>is</i> incurable without transgression.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>What man <i>is</i> like Job, <i>who</i> drinketh up scorning like water?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, <i>that he should do</i> wickedness; and <i>from</i> the Almighty, <i>that he should commit</i> iniquity.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>If he set his heart upon man, <i>if</i> he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>For his eyes <i>are</i> upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span><i>There is</i> no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>For he will not lay upon man more <i>than right</i>; that he should enter into judgment with God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth <i>them</i> in the night, so that they are destroyed.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth <i>his</i> face, who then can behold him? whether <i>it be done</i> against a nation, or against a man only:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne <i>chastisement</i>, I will not offend <i>any more</i>:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span><i>That which</i> I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span><i>Should it be</i> according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words <i>were</i> without wisdom.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>My desire <i>is that</i> Job may be tried unto the end because of <i>his</i> answers for wicked men.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth <i>his hands</i> among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,</li>

<h1>Chapter 40</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Moreover the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> answered Job, and said,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct <i>him</i>? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Then Job answered the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and said,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Then answered the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Deck thyself now <i>with</i> majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one <i>that is</i> proud, and abase him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Look on every one <i>that is</i> proud, <i>and</i> bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Hide them in the dust together; <i>and</i> bind their faces in secret.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Lo now, his strength <i>is</i> in his loins, and his force <i>is</i> in the navel of his belly.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>His bones <i>are as</i> strong pieces of brass; his bones <i>are</i> like bars of iron.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>He <i>is</i> the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach <i>unto him</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>The shady trees cover him <i>with</i> their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>Behold, he drinketh up a river, <i>and</i> hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>He taketh it with his eyes: <i>his</i> nose pierceth through snares.</li>

<h1>Chapter 42</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Then Job answered the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and said,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>I know that thou canst do every <i>thing</i>, and <i>that</i> no thought can be withholden from thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Who <i>is</i> he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Wherefore I abhor <i>myself</i>, and repent in dust and ashes.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And it was <i>so</i>, that after the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> had spoken these words unto Job, the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me <i>the thing that is</i> right, as my servant Job <i>hath</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you <i>after your</i> folly, in that ye have not spoken of me <i>the thing which is</i> right, like my servant Job.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite <i>and</i> Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> commanded them: the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> also accepted Job.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> gave Job twice as much as he had before.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>So the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>He had also seven sons and three daughters.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And in all the land were no women found <i>so</i> fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons&#8217; sons, <i>even</i> four generations.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>So Job died, <i>being</i> old and full of days.</li>
