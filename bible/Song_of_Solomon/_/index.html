<h1>Chapter 8</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>O that thou <i>wert</i> as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! <i>when</i> I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>I would lead thee, <i>and</i> bring thee into my mother&#8217;s house, <i>who</i> would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>His left hand <i>should be</i> under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake <i>my</i> love, until he please.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Who <i>is</i> this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth <i>that</i> bare thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love <i>is</i> strong as death; jealousy <i>is</i> cruel as the grave: the coals thereof <i>are</i> coals of fire, <i>which hath a</i> most vehement flame.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if <i>a</i> man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>If she <i>be</i> a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she <i>be</i> a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>I <i>am</i> a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand <i>pieces</i> of silver.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>My vineyard, which <i>is</i> mine, <i>is</i> before me: thou, O Solomon, <i>must have</i> a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear <i>it</i>.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.</li>
</ul>
