<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness <i>was</i> upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">

<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And God saw the light, that <i>it was</i> good: and God divided the light from the darkness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which <i>were</i> under the firmament from the waters which <i>were</i> above the firmament: and it was so.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry <i>land</i> appear: and it was so.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And God called the dry <i>land</i> Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that <i>it was</i> good.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, <i>and</i> the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed <i>is</i> in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And the earth brought forth grass, <i>and</i> herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed <i>was</i> in itself, after his kind: and God saw that <i>it was</i> good.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And the evening and the morning were the third day.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: <i>he made</i> the stars also.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that <i>it was</i> good.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl <i>that</i> may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that <i>it was</i> good.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that <i>it was</i> good.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>So God created man in his <i>own</i> image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which <i>is</i> upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which <i>is</i> the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein <i>there is</i> life, <i>I have given</i> every green herb for meat: and it was so.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, <i>it was</i> very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.</li>

<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and <i>there was</i> not a man to till the ground.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God formed man <i>of</i> the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>The name of the first <i>is</i> Pison: that <i>is</i> it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where <i>there is</i> gold;</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And the rib, which the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</li>

<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>But of the fruit of the tree which <i>is</i> in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And when the woman saw that the tree <i>was</i> good for food, and that it <i>was</i> pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make <i>one</i> wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they <i>were</i> naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And they heard the voice of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God amongst the trees of the garden.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where <i>art</i> thou?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I <i>was</i> naked; and I hid myself.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And he said, Who told thee that thou <i>wast</i> naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest <i>to be</i> with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God said unto the woman, What <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou <i>art</i> cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire <i>shall be</i> to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed <i>is</i> the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat <i>of</i> it all the days of thy life;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou <i>art</i>, and unto dust shalt thou return.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And Adam called his wife&#8217;s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Unto Adam also and to his wife did the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God make coats of skins, and clothed them.</li>

<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> had respect unto Abel and to his offering:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee <i>shall be</i> his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou <i>art but</i> a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she <i>is</i> a man&#8217;s wife.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Said he not unto me, She <i>is</i> my sister? and she, even she herself said, He <i>is</i> my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Now therefore restore the man <i>his</i> wife; for he <i>is</i> a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore <i>her</i> not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that <i>are</i> thine.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave <i>them</i> unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, <i>and</i> also our little ones.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks&#8217; mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord&#8217;s house silver or gold?</li>
