<h1>Chapter 24</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And Abraham was old, <i>and</i> well stricken in age: and the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> had blessed Abraham in all things.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And I will make thee swear by the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>The L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God of heaven, which took me from my father&#8217;s house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master <i>were</i> in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, <i>even</i> the time that women go out to draw <i>water</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And he said, O L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Behold, I stand <i>here</i> by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: <i>let the same be</i> she <i>that</i> thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham&#8217;s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And the damsel <i>was</i> very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw <i>water</i> for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw <i>water</i>, and drew for all his camels.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> had made his journey prosperous or not.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten <i>shekels</i> weight of gold;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And said, Whose daughter <i>art</i> thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room <i>in</i> thy father&#8217;s house for us to lodge in?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And she said unto him, I <i>am</i> the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>And he said, Blessed <i>be</i> the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I <i>being</i> in the way, the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> led me to the house of my master&#8217;s brethren.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>And the damsel ran, and told <i>them of</i> her mother&#8217;s house these things.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And Rebekah had a brother, and his name <i>was</i> Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister&#8217;s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men&#8217;s feet that <i>were</i> with him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>And there was set <i>meat</i> before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>And he said, I <i>am</i> Abraham&#8217;s servant.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>And Sarah my master&#8217;s wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>But thou shalt go unto my father&#8217;s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span>And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>And he said unto me, The L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father&#8217;s house:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span>Then shalt thou be clear from <i>this</i> my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee <i>one</i>, thou shalt be clear from my oath.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span>And I came this day unto the well, and said, O L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span>Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw <i>water</i>, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span>And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: <i>let</i> the same <i>be</i> the woman whom the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> hath appointed out for my master&#8217;s son.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span>And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew <i>water</i>: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">46&nbsp;</span>And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her <i>shoulder</i>, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">47&nbsp;</span>And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter <i>art</i> thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor&#8217;s son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">48&nbsp;</span>And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, and blessed the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master&#8217;s brother&#8217;s daughter unto his son.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">49&nbsp;</span>And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">50&nbsp;</span>Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">51&nbsp;</span>Behold, Rebekah <i>is</i> before thee, take <i>her</i>, and go, and let her be thy master&#8217;s son&#8217;s wife, as the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> hath spoken.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">52&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that, when Abraham&#8217;s servant heard their words, he worshipped the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span>, <i>bowing himself</i> to the earth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">53&nbsp;</span>And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave <i>them</i> to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">54&nbsp;</span>And they did eat and drink, he and the men that <i>were</i> with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">55&nbsp;</span>And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us <i>a few</i> days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">56&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the L<span class="KJVsc">ORD</span> hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">57&nbsp;</span>And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">58&nbsp;</span>And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">59&nbsp;</span>And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham&#8217;s servant, and his men.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">60&nbsp;</span>And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou <i>art</i> our sister, be thou <i>the mother</i> of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">61&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">62&nbsp;</span>And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">63&nbsp;</span>And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels <i>were</i> coming.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">64&nbsp;</span>And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">65&nbsp;</span>For she <i>had</i> said unto the servant, What man <i>is</i> this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant <i>had</i> said, It <i>is</i> my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">66&nbsp;</span>And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">67&nbsp;</span>And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah&#8217;s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother&#8217;s <i>death</i>.</li>
