<h1>Chapter 25</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: <i>for</i> it is a year of rest unto the land.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And for thy cattle, and for the beast that <i>are</i> in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth <i>day</i> of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout <i>all</i> the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather <i>the grapes</i> in it of thy vine undressed.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>For it <i>is</i> the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest <i>ought</i> of thy neighbour&#8217;s hand, ye shall not oppress one another:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, <i>and</i> according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for <i>according</i> to the number <i>of the years</i> of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I <i>am</i> the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> your God.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat <i>yet</i> of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat <i>of</i> the old <i>store</i>.</li>

<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land <i>is</i> mine; for ye <i>are</i> strangers and sojourners with me.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>But if he be not able to restore <i>it</i> to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; <i>within</i> a full year may he redeem it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that <i>is</i> in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, <i>and</i> the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in <i>the year of</i> jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites <i>are</i> their possession among the children of Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it <i>is</i> their perpetual possession.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>I <i>am</i> the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, <i>and</i> to be your God.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And if thy brother <i>that dwelleth</i> by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span>Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, <i>shall be</i> of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span>Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that <i>are</i> with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">46&nbsp;</span>And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit <i>them for</i> a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.</li>

<ul class="KJV">
