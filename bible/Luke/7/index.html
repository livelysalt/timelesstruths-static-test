<h1>Chapter 7</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And a certain centurion&#8217;s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth <i>it</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Weep not.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare <i>him</i> stood still. And he said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And John calling <i>unto him</i> two of his disciples sent <i>them</i> to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And in that same hour he cured many of <i>their</i> infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many <i>that were</i> blind he gave sight.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus answering said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And blessed is <i>he</i>, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>But what went ye out for to see? <span class="KJV_Jesus">A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings&#8217; courts.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">This is <i>he</i>, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>And all the people that heard <i>him</i>, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the Lord said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But wisdom is justified of all her children.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee&#8217;s house, and sat down to meat.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that <i>Jesus</i> sat at meat in the Pharisee&#8217;s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>And stood at his feet behind <i>him</i> weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe <i>them</i> with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed <i>them</i> with the ointment.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span>Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw <i>it</i>, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman <i>this is</i> that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answering said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee.</span> And he saith, Master, say on.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span>Simon answered and said, I suppose that <i>he</i>, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Thou hast rightly judged.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span>And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped <i>them</i> with the hairs of her head.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">46&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">47&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, <i>the same</i> loveth little.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">48&nbsp;</span>And he said unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Thy sins are forgiven.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">49&nbsp;</span>And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">50&nbsp;</span>And he said to the woman, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</span></li>
