<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife <i>was</i> of the daughters of Aaron, and her name <i>was</i> Elisabeth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were <i>now</i> well stricken in years.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest&#8217;s office before God in the order of his course,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>According to the custom of the priest&#8217;s office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And when Zacharias saw <i>him</i>, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother&#8217;s womb.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on <i>me</i>, to take away my reproach among men.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin&#8217;s name <i>was</i> Mary.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, <i>thou that art</i> highly favoured, the Lord <i>is</i> with thee: blessed <i>art</i> thou among women.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>And when she saw <i>him</i>, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>For with God nothing shall be impossible.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span>And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed <i>art</i> thou among women, and blessed <i>is</i> the fruit of thy womb.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span>And whence <i>is</i> this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span>For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span>And blessed <i>is</i> she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">46&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">47&nbsp;</span>And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">48&nbsp;</span>For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">49&nbsp;</span>For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy <i>is</i> his name.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">50&nbsp;</span>And his mercy <i>is</i> on them that fear him from generation to generation.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">51&nbsp;</span>He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">52&nbsp;</span>He hath put down the mighty from <i>their</i> seats, and exalted them of low degree.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">53&nbsp;</span>He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">54&nbsp;</span>He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of <i>his</i> mercy;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">55&nbsp;</span>As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">56&nbsp;</span>And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">57&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now Elisabeth&#8217;s full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">58&nbsp;</span>And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">59&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">60&nbsp;</span>And his mother answered and said, Not <i>so</i>; but he shall be called John.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">61&nbsp;</span>And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">62&nbsp;</span>And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">63&nbsp;</span>And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">64&nbsp;</span>And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue <i>loosed</i>, and he spake, and praised God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">65&nbsp;</span>And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">66&nbsp;</span>And all they that heard <i>them</i> laid <i>them</i> up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">67&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">68&nbsp;</span>Blessed <i>be</i> the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">69&nbsp;</span>And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">70&nbsp;</span>As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">71&nbsp;</span>That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">72&nbsp;</span>To perform the mercy <i>promised</i> to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">73&nbsp;</span>The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">74&nbsp;</span>That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">75&nbsp;</span>In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">76&nbsp;</span>And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">77&nbsp;</span>To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">78&nbsp;</span>Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">79&nbsp;</span>To give light to them that sit in darkness and <i>in</i> the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">80&nbsp;</span>And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.</li>

<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>(<i>And</i> this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And this <i>shall be</i> a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And when they had seen <i>it</i>, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And all they that heard <i>it</i> wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>But Mary kept all these things, and pondered <i>them</i> in her heart.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present <i>him</i> to the Lord;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>(As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name <i>was</i> Simeon; and the same man <i>was</i> just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord&#8217;s Christ.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this <i>child</i> is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>(Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>And she <i>was</i> a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served <i>God</i> with fastings and prayers night and day.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span>And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span>And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span>And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not <i>of it</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span>But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day&#8217;s journey; and they sought him among <i>their</i> kinsfolk and acquaintance.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span>And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">46&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">47&nbsp;</span>And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.</li>

<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways <i>shall be</i> made smooth;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to <i>our</i> father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse <i>any</i> falsely; and be content with your wages.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>John answered, saying unto <i>them</i> all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Whose fan <i>is</i> in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip&#8217;s wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</span></li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long <i>season</i>, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked <i>him</i>, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined <i>him</i> before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>I will therefore chastise him, and release <i>him</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this <i>man</i>, and release unto us Barabbas:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>But they cried, saying, Crucify <i>him</i>, crucify him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let <i>him</i> go.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear <i>it</i> after Jesus.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>But Jesus turning unto them said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed <i>are</i> the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>Then said Jesus, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.</span> And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided <i>him</i>, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span>And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span>And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</span></li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">46&nbsp;</span>And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit:</span> and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.</li>

<h1>Chapter 24</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Now upon the first <i>day</i> of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain <i>others</i> with them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And as they were afraid, and bowed down <i>their</i> faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And they remembered his words,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary <i>the mother</i> of James, and other <i>women that were</i> with them, which told these things unto the apostles.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem <i>about</i> threescore furlongs.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that, while they communed <i>together</i> and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">What manner of communications <i>are</i> these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">What things?</span> And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found <i>it</i> even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Then he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed <i>it</i>, and brake, and gave to them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>And they told what things <i>were done</i> in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Peace <i>be</i> unto you.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them <i>his</i> hands and <i>his</i> feet.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span>And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Have ye here any meat?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span>And he took <i>it</i>, and did eat before them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">These <i>are</i> the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and <i>in</i> the prophets, and <i>in</i> the psalms, concerning me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span>Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">46&nbsp;</span>And said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">47&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">48&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And ye are witnesses of these things.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">49&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">50&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">51&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">52&nbsp;</span>And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">53&nbsp;</span>And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</li>
