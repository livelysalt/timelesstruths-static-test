<h1>Chapter 24</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Now upon the first <i>day</i> of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain <i>others</i> with them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And as they were afraid, and bowed down <i>their</i> faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And they remembered his words,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary <i>the mother</i> of James, and other <i>women that were</i> with them, which told these things unto the apostles.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem <i>about</i> threescore furlongs.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that, while they communed <i>together</i> and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">What manner of communications <i>are</i> these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">What things?</span> And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found <i>it</i> even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Then he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed <i>it</i>, and brake, and gave to them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>And they told what things <i>were done</i> in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Peace <i>be</i> unto you.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them <i>his</i> hands and <i>his</i> feet.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span>And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Have ye here any meat?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span>And he took <i>it</i>, and did eat before them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">These <i>are</i> the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and <i>in</i> the prophets, and <i>in</i> the psalms, concerning me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span>Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">46&nbsp;</span>And said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">47&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">48&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And ye are witnesses of these things.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">49&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">50&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">51&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">52&nbsp;</span>And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">53&nbsp;</span>And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</li>
