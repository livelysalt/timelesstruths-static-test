<h1>Chapter 23</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this <i>fellow</i> perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Thou sayest <i>it</i>.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Then said Pilate to the chief priests and <i>to</i> the people, I find no fault in this man.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod&#8217;s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long <i>season</i>, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked <i>him</i>, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined <i>him</i> before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>I will therefore chastise him, and release <i>him</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this <i>man</i>, and release unto us Barabbas:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>But they cried, saying, Crucify <i>him</i>, crucify him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let <i>him</i> go.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear <i>it</i> after Jesus.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>But Jesus turning unto them said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed <i>are</i> the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>Then said Jesus, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.</span> And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided <i>him</i>, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span>And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span>And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">46&nbsp;</span>And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit:</span> and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">47&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">48&nbsp;</span>And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">49&nbsp;</span>And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">50&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And, behold, <i>there was</i> a man named Joseph, a counsellor; <i>and he was</i> a good man, and a just:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">51&nbsp;</span>(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) <i>he was</i> of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">52&nbsp;</span>This <i>man</i> went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">53&nbsp;</span>And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">54&nbsp;</span>And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">55&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">56&nbsp;</span>And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.</li>
</ul>
