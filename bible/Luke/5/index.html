<h1>Chapter 5</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing <i>their</i> nets.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon&#8217;s, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And they beckoned unto <i>their</i> partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>When Simon Peter saw <i>it</i>, he fell down at Jesus&#8217; knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And so <i>was</i> also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on <i>his</i> face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And he put forth <i>his</i> hand, and touched him, saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">I will: be thou clean.</span> And immediately the leprosy departed from him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And he charged him to <span class="KJV_Jesus">tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was <i>present</i> to heal them.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought <i>means</i> to bring him in, and to lay <i>him</i> before him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And when they could not find by what <i>way</i> they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with <i>his</i> couch into the midst before Jesus.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">What reason ye in your hearts?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins,</span> (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) <span class="KJV_Jesus">I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Follow me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>And he left all, rose up, and followed him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answering said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise <i>the disciples</i> of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And he spake also a parable unto them; <span class="KJV_Jesus">No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was <i>taken</i> out of the new agreeth not with the old.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">No man also having drunk old <i>wine</i> straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.</span></li>
