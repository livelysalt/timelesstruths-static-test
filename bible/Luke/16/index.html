<h1>Chapter 16</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And he said also unto his disciples, <span class="KJV_Jesus">There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">So he called every one of his lord&#8217;s debtors <i>unto him</i>, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true <i>riches</i>?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man&#8217;s, who shall give you that which is your own?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">The law and the prophets <i>were</i> until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from <i>her</i> husband committeth adultery.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span><span class="KJV_Jesus">There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man&#8217;s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham&#8217;s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that <i>would come</i> from thence.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father&#8217;s house:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</span></li>
