<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Not as Cain, <i>who</i> was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother&#8217;s righteous.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not <i>his</i> brother abideth in death.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Hereby perceive we the love <i>of God</i>, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down <i>our</i> lives for the brethren.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>But whoso hath this world&#8217;s good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels <i>of compassion</i> from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, <i>then</i> have we confidence toward God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.</li>
