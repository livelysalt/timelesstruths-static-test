<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called <i>to be</i> an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And declared <i>to be</i> the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called <i>to be</i> saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed <i>it</i> unto them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, <i>even</i> his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Because that, when they knew God, they glorified <i>him</i> not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>And even as they did not like to retain God in <i>their</i> knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</li>
