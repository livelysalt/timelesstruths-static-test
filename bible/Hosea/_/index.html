<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>The word of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, <i>and</i> Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>The beginning of the word of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> by Hosea. And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, <i>departing</i> from the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little <i>while</i>, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And <i>God</i> said unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Then said <i>God</i>, Call his name Loammi: for ye <i>are</i> not my people, and I will not be your <i>God</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> in the place where it was said unto them, Ye <i>are</i> not my people, <i>there</i> it shall be said unto them, <i>Ye are</i> the sons of the living God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great <i>shall be</i> the day of Jezreel.</li>

<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Plead with your mother, plead: for she <i>is</i> not my wife, neither <i>am</i> I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they <i>be</i> the children of whoredoms.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give <i>me</i> my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find <i>them</i>: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then <i>was it</i> better with me than now.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, <i>which</i> they prepared for Baal.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax <i>given</i> to cover her nakedness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These <i>are</i> my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And it shall be at that day, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, <i>that</i> thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and <i>with</i> the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to <i>them which were</i> not my people, Thou <i>art</i> my people; and they shall say, <i>Thou art</i> my God.</li>

<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Then said the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of <i>her</i> friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>So I bought her to me for fifteen <i>pieces</i> of silver, and <i>for</i> an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for <i>another</i> man: so <i>will</i> I also <i>be</i> for thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and <i>without</i> teraphim:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> their God, and David their king; and shall fear the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> and his goodness in the latter days.</li>

<h1>Chapter 4</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Hear the word of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, ye children of Israel: for the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because <i>there is</i> no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people <i>are</i> as they that strive with the priest.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>As they were increased, so they sinned against me: <i>therefore</i> will I change their glory into shame.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused <i>them</i> to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof <i>is</i> good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people <i>that</i> doth not understand shall fall.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, <i>yet</i> let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven, nor swear, The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> liveth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> will feed them as a lamb in a large place.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Ephraim <i>is</i> joined to idols: let him alone.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers <i>with</i> shame do love, Give ye.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.</li>

<h1>Chapter 5</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment <i>is</i> toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I <i>have been</i> a rebuker of them all.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, <i>and</i> Israel is defiled.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms <i>is</i> in the midst of them, and they have not known the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>; but they shall not find <i>him</i>; he hath withdrawn himself from them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>They have dealt treacherously against the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, <i>and</i> the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud <i>at</i> Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: <i>therefore</i> I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Ephraim <i>is</i> oppressed <i>and</i> broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Therefore <i>will</i> I <i>be</i> unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah <i>saw</i> his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>For I <i>will be</i> unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, <i>even</i> I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue <i>him</i>.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Then shall we know, <i>if</i> we follow on to know the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter <i>and</i> former rain unto the earth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness <i>is</i> as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.</li>

<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span><i>Set</i> the trumpet to thy mouth. <i>He shall come</i> as an eagle against the house of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Israel hath cast off <i>the thing that is</i> good: the enemy shall pursue him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew <i>it</i> not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast <i>thee</i> off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long <i>will it be</i> ere they attain to innocency?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>For from Israel <i>was</i> it also: the workman made it; therefore it <i>is</i> not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein <i>is</i> no pleasure.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>I have written to him the great things of my law, <i>but</i> they were counted as a strange thing.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>They sacrifice flesh <i>for</i> the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat <i>it; but</i> the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.</li>

<h1>Chapter 9</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as <i>other</i> people: for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>They shall not dwell in the L<span class="caps-s">ORD&#8217;S</span> land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean <i>things</i> in Assyria.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>They shall not offer wine <i>offerings</i> to the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices <i>shall be</i> unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant <i>places</i> for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns <i>shall be</i> in their tabernacles.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know <i>it</i>: the prophet <i>is</i> a fool, the spiritual man <i>is</i> mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>The watchman of Ephraim <i>was</i> with my God: <i>but</i> the prophet <i>is</i> a snare of a fowler in all his ways, <i>and</i> hatred in the house of his God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>They have deeply corrupted <i>themselves</i>, as in the days of Gibeah: <i>therefore</i> he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time: <i>but</i> they went to Baalpeor, and separated themselves unto <i>that</i> shame; and <i>their</i> abominations were according as they loved.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span><i>As for</i> Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, <i>that there shall</i> not <i>be</i> a man <i>left</i>: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, <i>is</i> planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Give them, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>All their wickedness <i>is</i> in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love them no more: all their princes <i>are</i> revolters.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay <i>even</i> the beloved <i>fruit</i> of their womb.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof <i>that</i> rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for <i>it is</i> time to seek the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon <i>her</i> children.</li>
