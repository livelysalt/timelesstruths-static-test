<h1>Chapter 12</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>The rich <i>man</i> had exceeding many flocks and herds:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>But the poor <i>man</i> had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man&#8217;s lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And David&#8217;s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, <i>As</i> the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> liveth, the man that hath done this <i>thing</i> shall surely die:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And Nathan said to David, Thou <i>art</i> the man. Thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And I gave thee thy master&#8217;s house, and thy master&#8217;s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if <i>that had been</i> too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife <i>to be</i> thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give <i>them</i> unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>For thou didst <i>it</i> secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>. And Nathan said unto David, The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> to blaspheme, the child also <i>that is</i> born unto thee shall surely die.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And Nathan departed unto his house. And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> struck the child that Uriah&#8217;s wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And the elders of his house arose, <i>and went</i> to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed <i>himself</i>, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Then said his servants unto him, What thing <i>is</i> this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, <i>while it was</i> alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell <i>whether</i> GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> loved him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>And he took their king&#8217;s crown from off his head, the weight whereof <i>was</i> a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was <i>set</i> on David&#8217;s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>And he brought forth the people that <i>were</i> therein, and put <i>them</i> under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.</li>
