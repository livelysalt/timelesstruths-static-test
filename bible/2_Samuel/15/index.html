<h1>Chapter 15</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was <i>so</i>, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city <i>art</i> thou? And he said, Thy servant <i>is</i> of one of the tribes of Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters <i>are</i> good and right; but <i>there is</i> no man <i>deputed</i> of the king to hear thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And it was <i>so</i>, that when any man came nigh <i>to him</i> to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, in Hebron.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, <i>that were</i> called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David&#8217;s counsellor, from his city, <i>even</i> from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And David said unto all his servants that <i>were</i> with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not <i>else</i> escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And the king&#8217;s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants <i>are ready to do</i> whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, <i>which were</i> concubines, to keep the house.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou <i>art</i> a stranger, and also an exile.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Whereas thou camest <i>but</i> yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth <i>be</i> with thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And Ittai answered the king, and said, <i>As</i> the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> liveth, and <i>as</i> my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that <i>were</i> with him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites <i>were</i> with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, he will bring me again, and shew me <i>both</i> it, and his habitation:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, <i>here am</i> I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>The king said also unto Zadok the priest, <i>Art not</i> thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>And David went up by the ascent of <i>mount</i> Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that <i>was</i> with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>And <i>one</i> told David, saying, Ahithophel <i>is</i> among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that <i>when</i> David was come to the top <i>of the mount</i>, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; <i>as</i> I <i>have been</i> thy father&#8217;s servant hitherto, so <i>will</i> I now also <i>be</i> thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>And <i>hast thou</i> not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, <i>that</i> what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king&#8217;s house, thou shalt tell <i>it</i> to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>Behold, <i>they have</i> there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok&#8217;s <i>son</i>, and Jonathan Abiathar&#8217;s <i>son</i>; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>So Hushai David&#8217;s friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.</li>
