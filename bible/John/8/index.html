<h1>Chapter 8</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with <i>his</i> finger wrote on the ground, <i>as though he heard them not</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And they which heard <i>it</i>, being convicted by <i>their own</i> conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, <i>even</i> unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered and said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Though I bear record of myself, <i>yet</i> my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Then said Jesus again unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am <i>he</i>, ye shall die in your sins.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Even <i>the same</i> that I said unto you from the beginning.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>Then said Jesus unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am <i>he</i>, and <i>that</i> I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>As he spake these words, many believed on him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">If ye continue in my word, <i>then</i> are ye my disciples indeed;</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>They answered him, We be Abraham&#8217;s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: <i>but</i> the Son abideth ever.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">I know that ye are Abraham&#8217;s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span>They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">If ye were Abraham&#8217;s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Ye do the deeds of your father.</span> Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, <i>even</i> God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span>Jesus said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Why do ye not understand my speech? <i>even</i> because ye cannot hear my word.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Ye are of <i>your</i> father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And because I tell <i>you</i> the truth, ye believe me not.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">46&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">47&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">He that is of God heareth God&#8217;s words: ye therefore hear <i>them</i> not, because ye are not of God.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">48&nbsp;</span>Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">49&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class="KJV_Jesus">I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">50&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">51&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">52&nbsp;</span>Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">53&nbsp;</span>Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">54&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class="KJV_Jesus">If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">55&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">56&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw <i>it</i>, and was glad.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">57&nbsp;</span>Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">58&nbsp;</span>Jesus said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">59&nbsp;</span>Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</li>
