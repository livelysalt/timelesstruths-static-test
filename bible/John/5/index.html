<h1>Chapter 5</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep <i>market</i> a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time <i>in that case</i>, he saith unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Wilt thou be made whole?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry <i>thy</i> bed.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in <i>that</i> place.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>But Jesus answered them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Then answered Jesus and said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth <i>them</i>; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">That all <i>men</i> should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But I have greater witness than <i>that</i> of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">I receive not honour from men.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">I am come in my Father&#8217;s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that <i>cometh</i> from God only?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is <i>one</i> that accuseth you, <i>even</i> Moses, in whom ye trust.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">46&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">47&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?</span></li>
