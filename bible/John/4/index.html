<h1>Chapter 4</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And he must needs go through Samaria.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Now Jacob&#8217;s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with <i>his</i> journey, sat thus on the well: <i>and</i> it was about the sixth hour.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Give me to drink.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered and said unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered and said unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">God <i>is</i> a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship <i>him</i> in spirit and in truth.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">I that speak unto thee am <i>he</i>.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>But he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him <i>ought</i> to eat?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Say not ye, There are yet four months, and <i>then</i> cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span>And many more believed because of his own word;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span>And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard <i>him</i> ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span>For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span>Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">46&nbsp;</span>So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">47&nbsp;</span>When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">48&nbsp;</span>Then said Jesus unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">49&nbsp;</span>The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">50&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Go thy way; thy son liveth.</span> And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">51&nbsp;</span>And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told <i>him</i>, saying, Thy son liveth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">52&nbsp;</span>Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">53&nbsp;</span>So the father knew that <i>it was</i> at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Thy son liveth:</span> and himself believed, and his whole house.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">54&nbsp;</span>This <i>is</i> again the second miracle <i>that</i> Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.</li>
