<h1>Chapter 7</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now the Jews&#8217; feast of tabernacles was at hand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>For <i>there is</i> no man <i>that</i> doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>For neither did his brethren believe in him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>When he had said these words unto them, he abode <i>still</i> in Galilee.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, and said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or <i>whether</i> I speak of myself.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Did not Moses give you the law, and <i>yet</i> none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered and said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this <i>man</i> hath done?</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>Then said Jesus unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Yet a little while am I with you, and <i>then</i> I go unto him that sent me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Ye shall seek me, and shall not find <i>me</i>: and where I am, <i>thither</i> ye cannot come.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>What <i>manner of</i> saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find <i>me</i>: and where I am, <i>thither</i> ye cannot come?</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>In the last day, that great <i>day</i> of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span>(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet <i>given</i>; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span>Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span>Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span>So there was a division among the people because of him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span>And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">46&nbsp;</span>The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">47&nbsp;</span>Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">48&nbsp;</span>Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">49&nbsp;</span>But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">50&nbsp;</span>Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">51&nbsp;</span>Doth our law judge <i>any</i> man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">52&nbsp;</span>They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">53&nbsp;</span>And every man went unto his own house.</li>
