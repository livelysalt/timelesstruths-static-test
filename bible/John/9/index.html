<h1>Chapter 9</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And as <i>Jesus</i> passed by, he saw a man which was blind from <i>his</i> birth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Go, wash in the pool of Siloam,</span> (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Some said, This is he: others <i>said</i>, He is like him: <i>but</i> he said, I am <i>he</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>These <i>words</i> spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner <i>or no</i>, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear <i>it</i> again? will ye also be his disciples?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses&#8217; disciples.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>We know that God spake unto Moses: <i>as for</i> this <i>fellow</i>, we know not from whence he is.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and <i>yet</i> he hath opened mine eyes.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And Jesus said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>And <i>some</i> of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span>Jesus said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.</span></li>
