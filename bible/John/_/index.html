<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>The same was in the beginning with God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>There was a man sent from God, whose name <i>was</i> John.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all <i>men</i> through him might believe.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>He was not that Light, but <i>was sent</i> to bear witness of that Light.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span><i>That</i> was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, <i>even</i> to them that believe on his name:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>For the law was given by Moses, <i>but</i> grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared <i>him</i>.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>He said, I <i>am</i> the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe&#8217;s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">What seek ye?</span> They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span>He saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Come and see.</span> They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>One of the two which heard John <i>speak</i>, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter&#8217;s brother.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span>He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span>And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas,</span> which is by interpretation, A stone.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Follow me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span>Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span>Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">46&nbsp;</span>And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">47&nbsp;</span>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">48&nbsp;</span>Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">49&nbsp;</span>Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">50&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered and said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">51&nbsp;</span>And he saith unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</span></li>

<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do <i>it</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Fill the waterpots with water.</span> And they filled them up to the brim.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And he saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast.</span> And they bare <i>it</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: <i>but</i> thou hast kept the good wine until now.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the Jews&#8217; passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers&#8217; money, and overthrew the tables;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And said unto them that sold doves, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Take these things hence; make not my Father&#8217;s house an house of merchandise.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered and said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>But he spake of the temple of his body.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast <i>day</i>, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all <i>men</i>,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.</li>

<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered and said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother&#8217;s womb, and be born?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and <i>of</i> the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</span></li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered and said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you <i>of</i> heavenly things?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, <i>even</i> the Son of man which is in heaven.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Then there arose a question between <i>some</i> of John&#8217;s disciples and the Jews about purifying.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom&#8217;s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure <i>unto him</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Now Jacob&#8217;s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with <i>his</i> journey, sat thus on the well: <i>and</i> it was about the sixth hour.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Give me to drink.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered and said unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered and said unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</span></li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</span></li>

<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">

<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him <i>ought</i> to eat?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.</li>

<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</li>

<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep <i>market</i> a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time <i>in that case</i>, he saith unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Wilt thou be made whole?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry <i>thy</i> bed.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in <i>that</i> place.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">

<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>When Jesus then lifted up <i>his</i> eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?</span></li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter&#8217;s brother, saith unto him,</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.</li>

<h1>Chapter 7</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now the Jews&#8217; feast of tabernacles was at hand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>For <i>there is</i> no man <i>that</i> doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>For neither did his brethren believe in him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>When he had said these words unto them, he abode <i>still</i> in Galilee.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, and said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or <i>whether</i> I speak of myself.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Did not Moses give you the law, and <i>yet</i> none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered and said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this <i>man</i> hath done?</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>What <i>manner of</i> saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find <i>me</i>: and where I am, <i>thither</i> ye cannot come?</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>In the last day, that great <i>day</i> of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span>(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet <i>given</i>; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span>Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span>Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span>So there was a division among the people because of him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span>And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">

<li><span class="KJV_num">47&nbsp;</span>Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">48&nbsp;</span>Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?</li>

<h1>Chapter 8</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with <i>his</i> finger wrote on the ground, <i>as though he heard them not</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And they which heard <i>it</i>, being convicted by <i>their own</i> conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, <i>even</i> unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</span></li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered and said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Though I bear record of myself, <i>yet</i> my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</span></li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.</span></li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span>They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">If ye were Abraham&#8217;s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</span></li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Ye do the deeds of your father.</span> Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, <i>even</i> God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span>Jesus said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Why do ye not understand my speech? <i>even</i> because ye cannot hear my word.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Ye are of <i>your</i> father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do.

<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And because I tell <i>you</i> the truth, ye believe me not.</span></li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">48&nbsp;</span>Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">49&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class="KJV_Jesus">I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">50&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</span></li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">53&nbsp;</span>Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">54&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class="KJV_Jesus">If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">55&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">56&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw <i>it</i>, and was glad.</span></li>

<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Now a certain <i>man</i> was sick, <i>named</i> Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>When Jesus heard <i>that</i>, he said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Then after that saith he to <i>his</i> disciples, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Let us go into Judaea again.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><i>His</i> disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Then said Jesus unto them plainly, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Lazarus is dead.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.</span></li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Then when Jesus came, he found that he had <i>lain</i> in the grave four days already.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat <i>still</i> in the house.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give <i>it</i> thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Thy brother shall rise again.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Jesus said unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>As soon as she heard <i>that</i>, she arose quickly, and came unto him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>And said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Where have ye laid him?</span> They said unto him, Lord, come and see.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>Jesus wept.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Take ye away the stone.</span> Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been <i>dead</i> four days.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span>Then they took away the stone <i>from the place</i> where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up <i>his</i> eyes, and said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said <i>it</i>, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span>And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Lazarus, come forth.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span>And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Loose him, and let him go.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span>Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">46&nbsp;</span>But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">47&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">49&nbsp;</span>And one of them, <i>named</i> Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">50&nbsp;</span>Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">51&nbsp;</span>And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">52&nbsp;</span>And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">53&nbsp;</span>Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">54&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">57&nbsp;</span>Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew <i>it</i>, that they might take him.</li>

<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Judas then, having received a band <i>of men</i> and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Whom seek ye?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">I am <i>he</i>.</span> And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>As soon then as he had said unto them, I am <i>he</i>, they went backward, and fell to the ground.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Then asked he them again, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Whom seek ye?</span> And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class="KJV_Jesus">I have told you that I am <i>he</i>: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:</span></li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest&#8217;s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant&#8217;s name was Malchus.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</li>

<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and <i>so did</i> another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also <i>one</i> of this man&#8217;s disciples? He saith, I am not.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>One of the servants of the high priest, being <i>his</i> kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class="KJV_Jesus">My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Thou sayest that I am a king.

<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault <i>at all</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span>But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</li>

<h1>Chapter 20</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>The first <i>day</i> of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And he stooping down, <i>and looking in</i>, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, <i>and looked</i> into the sepulchre,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou?</span> She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Mary.</span> She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and <i>to</i> my God, and your God.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and <i>that</i> he had spoken these things unto her.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Then the same day at evening, being the first <i>day</i> of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Peace <i>be</i> unto you.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And when he had so said, he shewed unto them <i>his</i> hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Then said Jesus to them again, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Peace <i>be</i> unto you: as <i>my</i> Father hath sent me, even so send I you.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And when he had said this, he breathed on <i>them</i>, and saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Receive ye the Holy Ghost:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; <i>and</i> whose soever <i>sins</i> ye retain, they are retained.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: <i>then</i> came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Peace <i>be</i> unto you.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>Then saith he to Thomas, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust <i>it</i> into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed <i>are</i> they that have not seen, and <i>yet</i> have believed.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.</li>

<h1>Chapter 21</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he <i>himself</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the <i>sons</i> of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Children, have ye any meat?</span> They answered him, No.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find.</span> They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt <i>his</i> fisher&#8217;s coat <i>unto him</i>, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Come <i>and</i> dine.</span> And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Simon, <i>son</i> of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?</span> He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Feed my lambs.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>He saith to him again the second time, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Simon, <i>son</i> of Jonas, lovest thou me?</span> He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Feed my sheep.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>He saith unto him the third time, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Simon, <i>son</i> of Jonas, lovest thou me?</span> Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Feed my sheep.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry <i>thee</i> whither thou wouldest not.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Follow me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what <i>shall</i> this man <i>do</i>?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Jesus saith unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">If I will that he tarry till I come, what <i>is that</i> to thee? follow thou me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what <i>is that</i> to thee?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.</li>
