<h1>Chapter 12</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon&#8217;s <i>son</i>, which should betray him,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Then said Jesus, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus&#8217; sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed <i>is</i> the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass&#8217;s colt.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and <i>that</i> they had done these things unto him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And Jesus answered them, saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will <i>my</i> Father honour.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Father, glorify thy name.</span> Then came there a voice from heaven, <i>saying</i>, I have both glorified <i>it</i>, and will glorify <i>it</i> again.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>The people therefore, that stood by, and heard <i>it</i>, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered and said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all <i>men</i> unto me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>This he said, signifying what death he should die.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light.</span> These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span>Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with <i>their</i> eyes, nor understand with <i>their</i> heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span>These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess <i>him</i>, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span>For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Jesus cried and said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">46&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">47&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">48&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">49&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">50&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.</span></li>
