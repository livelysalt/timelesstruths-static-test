<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>This <i>shall be</i> the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation, <i>about</i> the most holy things:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his sons, and they shall take down the covering vail, and cover the ark of testimony with it:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And shall put thereon the covering of badgers&#8217; skins, and shall spread over <i>it</i> a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in the staves thereof.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers to cover withal: and the continual bread shall be thereon:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the same with a covering of badgers&#8217; skins, and shall put in the staves thereof.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering of badgers&#8217; skins, and shall put <i>it</i> upon a bar.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, and cover it with a covering of badgers&#8217; skins, and shall put to the staves thereof:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And they shall take all the instruments of ministry, wherewith they minister in the sanctuary, and put <i>them</i> in a cloth of blue, and cover them with a covering of badgers&#8217; skins, and shall put <i>them</i> on a bar:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth thereon:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith they minister about it, <i>even</i> the censers, the fleshhooks, and the shovels, and the basons, all the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers&#8217; skins, and put to the staves of it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear <i>it</i>: but they shall not touch <i>any</i> holy thing, lest they die.
