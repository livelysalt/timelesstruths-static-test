<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>To Timothy, <i>my</i> dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, <i>and</i> peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>I thank God, whom I serve from <i>my</i> forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Who hath saved us, and called <i>us</i> with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found <i>me</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</li>

<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of <i>this</i> life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And if a man also strive for masteries, <i>yet</i> is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, <i>even</i> unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Therefore I endure all things for the elect&#8217;s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span><i>It is</i> a faithful saying: For if we be dead with <i>him</i>, we shall also live with <i>him</i>:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>If we suffer, we shall also reign with <i>him</i>: if we deny <i>him</i>, he also will deny us:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>If we believe not, <i>yet</i> he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Of these things put <i>them</i> in remembrance, charging <i>them</i> before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, <i>but</i> to the subverting of the hearers.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>But shun profane <i>and</i> vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master&#8217;s use, <i>and</i> prepared unto every good work.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all <i>men</i>, apt to teach, patient,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>And <i>that</i> they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</li>

<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all <i>men</i>, as theirs also was.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of <i>them</i> all the Lord delivered me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned <i>them</i>;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>All scripture <i>is</i> given by inspiration of God, and <i>is</i> profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</li>

<h1>Chapter 4</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>I charge <i>thee</i> therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And they shall turn away <i>their</i> ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>I have fought a good fight, I have finished <i>my</i> course, I have kept the faith:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring <i>with thee</i>, and the books, <i>but</i> especially the parchments.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>At my first answer no man stood with me, but all <i>men</i> forsook me: <i>I pray God</i> that it may not be laid to their charge.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and <i>that</i> all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve <i>me</i> unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom <i>be</i> glory for ever and ever. Amen.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>The Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with thy spirit. Grace <i>be</i> with you. Amen.</li>
