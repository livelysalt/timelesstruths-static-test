<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath been sore displeased with your fathers.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and <i>from</i> your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Your fathers, where <i>are</i> they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which <i>is</i> the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that <i>were</i> in the bottom; and behind him <i>were there</i> red horses, speckled, and white.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Then said I, O my lord, what <i>are</i> these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these <i>be</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These <i>are they</i> whom the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And they answered the angel of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Then the angel of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> answered and said, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> answered the angel that talked with me <i>with</i> good words <i>and</i> comfortable words.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And I am very sore displeased with the heathen <i>that are</i> at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What <i>be</i> these? And he answered me, These <i>are</i> the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> shewed me four carpenters.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These <i>are</i> the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up <i>their</i> horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.</li>

<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what <i>is</i> the breadth thereof, and what <i>is</i> the length thereof.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited <i>as</i> towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>For I, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Ho, ho, <i>come forth</i>, and flee from the land of the north, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest <i>with</i> the daughter of Babylon.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>For thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts hath sent me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And many nations shall be joined to the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts hath sent me unto thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Be silent, O all flesh, before the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.</li>

<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> said unto Satan, The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> rebuke thee, O Satan; even the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: <i>is</i> not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> stood by.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And the angel of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> protested unto Joshua, saying,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they <i>are</i> men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone <i>shall be</i> seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>In that day, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.</li>

<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all <i>of</i> gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which <i>are</i> upon the top thereof:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And two olive trees by it, one upon the right <i>side</i> of the bowl, and the other upon the left <i>side</i> thereof.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What <i>are</i> these, my lord?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This <i>is</i> the word of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Who <i>art</i> thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel <i>thou shalt become</i> a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone <i>thereof with</i> shoutings, <i>crying</i>, Grace, grace unto it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Moreover the word of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> came unto me, saying,</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel <i>with</i> those seven; they <i>are</i> the eyes of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, which run to and fro through the whole earth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Then answered I, and said unto him, What <i>are</i> these two olive trees upon the right <i>side</i> of the candlestick and upon the left <i>side</i> thereof?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And I answered again, and said unto him, What <i>be these</i> two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden <i>oil</i> out of themselves?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these <i>be</i>? And I said, No, my lord.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof <i>is</i> twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Then said he unto me, This <i>is</i> the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off <i>as</i> on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off <i>as</i> on that side according to it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>I will bring it forth, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what <i>is</i> this that goeth forth.</li>

<h1>Chapter 6</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains <i>were</i> mountains of brass.</li>

<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Again the word of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts came <i>to me</i>, saying,</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts the holy mountain.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>For thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts, and I repented not:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And the word of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts came unto me, saying,</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts; <i>It shall</i> yet <i>come to pass</i>, that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And the inhabitants of one <i>city</i> shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and to seek the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts: I will go also.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And this shall be the plague wherewith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, <i>that</i> a great tumult from the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And it shall be, <i>that</i> whoso will not come up of <i>all</i> the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that <i>have</i> no <i>rain</i>; there shall be the plague, wherewith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the L<span class="caps-s">ORD&#8217;S</span> house shall be like the bowls before the altar.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe therein: and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts.</li>
