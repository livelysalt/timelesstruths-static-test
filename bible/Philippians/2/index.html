<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>If <i>there be</i> therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, <i>being</i> of one accord, of one mind.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span><i>Let</i> nothing <i>be done</i> through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of <i>things</i> in heaven, and <i>things</i> in earth, and <i>things</i> under the earth;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And <i>that</i> every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ <i>is</i> Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of <i>his</i> good pleasure.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Do all things without murmurings and disputings:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ&#8217;s.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.</li>
