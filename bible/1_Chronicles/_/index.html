<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which <i>is</i> the city of David.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>So David waxed greater and greater: for the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts <i>was</i> with him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>These also <i>are</i> the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, <i>and</i> with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> concerning Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And this <i>is</i> the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain <i>by him</i> at one time.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And after him <i>was</i> Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who <i>was one</i> of the three mighties.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And they set themselves in the midst of <i>that</i> parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> saved <i>them</i> by a great deliverance.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And David <i>was</i> then in the hold, and the Philistines&#8217; garrison <i>was</i> then at Bethlehem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that <i>is</i> at the gate!</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that <i>was</i> by the gate, and took <i>it</i>, and brought <i>it</i> to David: but David would not drink <i>of</i> it, but poured it out to the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with <i>the jeopardy of</i> their lives they brought it.

<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew <i>them</i>, and had a name among the three.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the <i>first</i> three.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And he slew an Egyptian, a man of <i>great</i> stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian&#8217;s hand <i>was</i> a spear like a weaver&#8217;s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian&#8217;s hand, and slew him with his own spear.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>These <i>things</i> did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the <i>first</i> three: and David set him over his guard.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>The chief <i>was</i> Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite,</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>These <i>were</i> of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the least <i>was</i> over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>These <i>are</i> they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all <i>them</i> of the valleys, <i>both</i> toward the east, and toward the west.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be knit unto you: but if <i>ye be come</i> to betray me to mine enemies, seeing <i>there is</i> no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look <i>thereon</i>, and rebuke <i>it</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Then the spirit came upon Amasai, <i>who was</i> chief of the captains, <i>and he said</i>, Thine <i>are we</i>, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace <i>be</i> unto thee, and peace <i>be</i> to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee.

<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And there fell <i>some</i> of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to <i>the jeopardy of</i> our heads.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that <i>were</i> of Manasseh.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel <i>were</i> of one heart to make David king.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span>And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>Moreover they that were nigh them, <i>even</i> unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, <i>and</i> meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for <i>there was</i> joy in Israel.</li>

<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, <i>and</i> with every leader.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If <i>it seem</i> good unto you, and <i>that it be</i> of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, <i>that are</i> left in all the land of Israel, and with them <i>also</i> to the priests and Levites <i>which are</i> in their cities <i>and</i> suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, <i>that is</i>, to Kirjathjearim, which <i>belonged</i> to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, that dwelleth <i>between</i> the cherubims, whose name is called <i>on it</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And David and all Israel played before God with all <i>their</i> might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And the anger of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And David was displeased, because the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>So David brought not the ark <i>home</i> to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.</li>

<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> <i>remaineth</i> under curtains.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that <i>is</i> in thine heart; for God <i>is</i> with thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from <i>one</i> tabernacle <i>to another</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, <i>even</i> from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that <i>are</i> in the earth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And since the time that I commanded judges <i>to be</i> over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> will build thee an house.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go <i>to be</i> with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took <i>it</i> from <i>him</i> that was before thee:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And David the king came and sat before the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and said, Who <i>am</i> I, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> God, and what <i>is</i> mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And <i>yet</i> this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast <i>also</i> spoken of thy servant&#8217;s house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>What can David <i>speak</i> more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, for thy servant&#8217;s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all <i>these</i> great things.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, <i>there is</i> none like thee, neither <i>is there any</i> God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And what one nation in the earth <i>is</i> like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem <i>to be</i> his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, becamest their God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>Therefore now, L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts <i>is</i> the God of Israel, <i>even</i> a God to Israel: and <i>let</i> the house of David thy servant <i>be</i> established before thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found <i>in his heart</i> to pray before thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>And now, L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and <i>it shall be</i> blessed for ever.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Then David put <i>garrisons</i> in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David&#8217;s servants, <i>and</i> brought gifts. Thus the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> preserved David whithersoever he went.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and <i>with him</i> all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Them also king David dedicated unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all <i>these</i> nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.</li>

<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me.

<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Wherefore Hanun took David&#8217;s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Then there went <i>certain</i>, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and <i>then</i> return.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put <i>them</i> in array against the Syrians.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set <i>themselves</i> in array against the children of Ammon.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> do <i>that which is</i> good in his sight.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>So Joab and the people that <i>were</i> with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that <i>were</i> beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer <i>went</i> before them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set <i>the battle</i> in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand <i>men which fought in</i> chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king&#8217;s word was abominable to Joab.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> spake unto Gad, David&#8217;s seer, saying,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, I offer thee three <i>things</i>: choose thee one of them, that I may do <i>it</i> unto thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, Choose thee</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Either three years&#8217; famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh <i>thee</i>; or else three days the sword of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>; for very great <i>are</i> his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>So the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders <i>of Israel, who were</i> clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And David said unto God, <i>Is it</i> not I <i>that</i> commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but <i>as for</i> these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> my God, be on me, and on my father&#8217;s house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Then the angel of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with <i>his</i> face to the ground.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of <i>this</i> threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And Ornan said unto David, Take <i>it</i> to thee, and let my lord the king do <i>that which is</i> good in his eyes: lo, I give <i>thee</i> the oxen <i>also</i> for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take <i>that</i> which <i>is</i> thine for the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>And David built there an altar unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>At that time when David saw that the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>For the tabernacle of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, <i>were</i> at that season in the high place at Gibeon.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>Then Solomon sat on the throne of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him <i>such</i> royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>And the time that he reigned over Israel <i>was</i> forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three <i>years</i> reigned he in Jerusalem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they <i>are</i> written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.</li>
