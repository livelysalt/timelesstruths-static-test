<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>That the generation to come might know <i>them, even</i> the children <i>which</i> should be born; <i>who</i> should arise and declare <i>them</i> to their children:</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation <i>that</i> set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>The children of Ephraim, <i>being</i> armed, <i>and</i> carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, <i>in</i> the field of Zoan.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave <i>them</i> drink as <i>out of</i> the great depths.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Therefore the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> heard <i>this</i>, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Man did eat angels&#8217; food: he sent them meat to the full.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>And he let <i>it</i> fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat <i>was</i> yet in their mouths,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen <i>men</i> of Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>And they remembered that God <i>was</i> their rock, and the high God their redeemer.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>But he, <i>being</i> full of compassion, forgave <i>their</i> iniquity, and destroyed <i>them</i> not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span>For he remembered that they <i>were but</i> flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, <i>and</i> grieve him in the desert!</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span>Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span>They remembered not his hand, <i>nor</i> the day when he delivered them from the enemy.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span>How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span>And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span>He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">46&nbsp;</span>He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">47&nbsp;</span>He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">48&nbsp;</span>He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">49&nbsp;</span>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels <i>among them</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">50&nbsp;</span>He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">51&nbsp;</span>And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of <i>their</i> strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">52&nbsp;</span>But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">53&nbsp;</span>And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">54&nbsp;</span>And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, <i>even to</i> this mountain, <i>which</i> his right hand had purchased.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">55&nbsp;</span>He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">56&nbsp;</span>Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">57&nbsp;</span>But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">58&nbsp;</span>For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">59&nbsp;</span>When God heard <i>this</i>, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">60&nbsp;</span>So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent <i>which</i> he placed among men;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">61&nbsp;</span>And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy&#8217;s hand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">62&nbsp;</span>He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">64&nbsp;</span>Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">65&nbsp;</span>Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, <i>and</i> like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">66&nbsp;</span>And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">67&nbsp;</span>Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">68&nbsp;</span>But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">69&nbsp;</span>And he built his sanctuary like high <i>palaces</i>, like the earth which he hath established for ever.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">70&nbsp;</span>He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">71&nbsp;</span>From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">72&nbsp;</span>So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>Thus they provoked <i>him</i> to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>They angered <i>him</i> also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> commanded them:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span>Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>Therefore was the wrath of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span>Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span>Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked <i>him</i> with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:</li>
