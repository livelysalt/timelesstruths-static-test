<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and <i>certain</i> men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province <i>are</i> in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also <i>is</i> broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned <i>certain</i> days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And said, I beseech thee, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father&#8217;s house have sinned.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, <i>If</i> ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>But <i>if</i> ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, <i>yet</i> will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Now these <i>are</i> thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king&#8217;s cupbearer.</li>

<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, <i>that</i> wine <i>was</i> before him: and I took up the wine, and gave <i>it</i> unto the king. Now I had not been <i>beforetime</i> sad in his presence.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Wherefore the king said unto me, Why <i>is</i> thy countenance sad, seeing thou <i>art</i> not sick? this <i>is</i> nothing <i>else</i> but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers&#8217; sepulchres, <i>lieth</i> waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers&#8217; sepulchres, that I may build it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king&#8217;s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which <i>appertained</i> to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king&#8217;s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard <i>of it</i>, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I <i>any</i> man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither <i>was there any</i> beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king&#8217;s pool: but <i>there was</i> no place for the beast <i>that was</i> under me to pass.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and <i>so</i> returned.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told <i>it</i> to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we <i>are</i> in, how Jerusalem <i>lieth</i> waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king&#8217;s words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for <i>this</i> good <i>work</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard <i>it</i>, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What <i>is</i> this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.</li>

<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel.</li>

<h1>Chapter 4</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Now Tobiah the Ammonite <i>was</i> by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked <i>thee</i> to anger before the builders.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>But it came to pass, <i>that</i> when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, <i>and</i> that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And conspired all of them together to come <i>and</i> to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and <i>there is</i> much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return unto us <i>they will be upon you</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, <i>and</i> on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, <i>which is</i> great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass from that time forth, <i>that</i> the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers <i>were</i> behind all the house of Judah.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, <i>every one</i> with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other <i>hand</i> held a weapon.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and <i>so</i> builded. And he that sounded the trumpet <i>was</i> by me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work <i>is</i> great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>In what place <i>therefore</i> ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, <i>saving that</i> every one put them off for washing.</li>

<h1>Chapter 5</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, <i>are</i> many: therefore we take up corn <i>for them</i>, that we may eat, and live.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span><i>Some</i> also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king&#8217;s tribute, <i>and that upon</i> our lands and vineyards.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Yet now our flesh <i>is</i> as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and <i>some</i> of our daughters are brought unto bondage <i>already</i>: neither <i>is it</i> in our power <i>to redeem them</i>; for other men have our lands and vineyards.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing <i>to answer</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Also I said, It <i>is</i> not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>I likewise, <i>and</i> my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth <i>part</i> of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Then said they, We will restore <i>them</i>, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied.

<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, <i>that is</i>, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Moreover <i>there were</i> at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that <i>are</i> about us.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Now <i>that</i> which was prepared <i>for me</i> daily <i>was</i> one ox <i>and</i> six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.</li>

<h1>Chapter 6</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and <i>that</i> there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in <i>some one of</i> the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I <i>am</i> doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Wherein <i>was</i> written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith <i>it, that</i> thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, <i>There is</i> a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, <i>O God</i>, strengthen my hands.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who <i>was</i> shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who <i>is there</i>, that, <i>being</i> as I <i>am</i>, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Therefore <i>was</i> he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and <i>that</i> they might have <i>matter</i> for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth <i>day</i> of <i>the month</i> Elul, in fifty and two days.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard <i>thereof</i>, and all the heathen that <i>were</i> about us saw <i>these things</i>, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and <i>the letters</i> of Tobiah came unto them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>For <i>there were</i> many in Judah sworn unto him, because he <i>was</i> the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. <i>And</i> Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</li>

<h1>Chapter 8</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that <i>was</i> before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> had commanded to Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And he read therein before the street that <i>was</i> before the water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people <i>were attentive</i> unto the book of the law.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, <i>and</i> Meshullam.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And Ezra blessed the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, the great God.

<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people <i>stood</i> in their place.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused <i>them</i> to understand the reading.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And Nehemiah, which <i>is</i> the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day <i>is</i> holy unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> your God; mourn not, nor weep.

<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for <i>this</i> day <i>is</i> holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> is your strength.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And they found written in the law which the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as <i>it is</i> written.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>So the people went forth, and brought <i>them</i>, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day <i>was</i> a solemn assembly, according unto the manner.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as <i>it is</i> this day.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou <i>art</i> a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This <i>is</i> thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, <i>so that</i> they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess <i>it</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest <i>them</i> from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest <i>them</i> from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless for thy great mercies&#8217; sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou <i>art</i> a gracious and merciful God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>Howbeit thou <i>art</i> just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>Behold, we <i>are</i> servants this day, and <i>for</i> the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we <i>are</i> servants in it:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we <i>are</i> in great distress.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>And because of all this we make a sure <i>covenant</i>, and write <i>it</i>; and our princes, Levites, <i>and</i> priests, seal <i>unto it</i>.</li>

<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, <i>was</i> allied unto Tobiah:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded <i>to be given</i> to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>But in all this <i>time</i> was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given <i>them</i>: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them <i>was</i> Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office <i>was</i> to distribute unto their brethren.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>In those days saw I in Judah <i>some</i> treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all <i>manner of</i> burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified <i>against them</i> in the day wherein they sold victuals.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing <i>is</i> this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and <i>some</i> of my servants set I at the gates, <i>that</i> there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do <i>so</i> again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no <i>more</i> on the sabbath.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and <i>that</i> they should come <i>and</i> keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, <i>concerning</i> this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>In those days also saw I Jews <i>that</i> had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, <i>and</i> of Moab:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews&#8217; language, but according to the language of each people.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, <i>saying</i>, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>And <i>one</i> of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, <i>was</i> son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.</li>
