<h1>Chapter 7</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he <i>was</i> a faithful man, and feared God above many.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar <i>them</i>: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one <i>to be</i> over against his house.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Now the city <i>was</i> large and great: but the people <i>were</i> few therein, and the houses <i>were</i> not builded.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found written therein,</li>
