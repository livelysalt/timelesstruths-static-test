<h1>Chapter 7</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Now consider how great this man <i>was</i>, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And here men that die receive tithes; but there he <i>receiveth them</i>, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need <i>was there</i> that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>For <i>it is</i> evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>For he testifieth, Thou <i>art</i> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope <i>did</i>; by the which we draw nigh unto God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And inasmuch as not without an oath <i>he was made priest</i>:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou <i>art</i> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>But this <i>man</i>, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>For such an high priest became us, <i>who is</i> holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people&#8217;s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, <i>maketh</i> the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</li>
</ul>
