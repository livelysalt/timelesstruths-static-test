<h1>Chapter 11</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>For by it the elders obtained a good report.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>But without faith <i>it is</i> impossible to please <i>him</i>: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and <i>that</i> he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as <i>in</i> a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker <i>is</i> God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, <i>so many</i> as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of <i>them</i>, and embraced <i>them</i>, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And truly, if they had been mindful of that <i>country</i> from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>But now they desire a better <i>country</i>, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten <i>son</i>,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>Accounting that God <i>was</i> able to raise <i>him</i> up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, <i>leaning</i> upon the top of his staff.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw <i>he was</i> a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king&#8217;s commandment.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry <i>land</i>: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and <i>of</i> Barak, and <i>of</i> Samson, and <i>of</i> Jephthae; <i>of</i> David also, and Samuel, and <i>of</i> the prophets:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>And others had trial of <i>cruel</i> mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and <i>in</i> mountains, and <i>in</i> dens and caves of the earth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span>And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.</li>
