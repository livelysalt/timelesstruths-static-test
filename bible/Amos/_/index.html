<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And he said, The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away <i>the punishment</i> thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Benhadad.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away <i>the punishment</i> thereof; because they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver <i>them</i> up to Edom:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the palaces thereof:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turn mine hand against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord G<span class="caps-s">OD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four, I will not turn away <i>the punishment</i> thereof; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus, which shall devour the palaces thereof.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>; For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away <i>the punishment</i> thereof; because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>; For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away <i>the punishment</i> thereof; because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge their border:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>

<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away <i>the punishment</i> thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, <i>and</i> with the sound of the trumpet:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away <i>the punishment</i> thereof; because they have despised the law of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away <i>the punishment</i> thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the <i>same</i> maid, to profane my holy name:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And they lay <i>themselves</i> down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned <i>in</i> the house of their god.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height <i>was</i> like the height of the cedars, and he <i>was</i> strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. <i>Is it</i> not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed <i>that is</i> full of sheaves.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and <i>he that is</i> swift of foot shall not deliver <i>himself</i>: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And <i>he that is</i> courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>

<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Hear this word that the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Can two walk together, except they be agreed?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin <i>is</i> for him? shall <i>one</i> take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath not done <i>it</i>?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Surely the Lord G<span class="caps-s">OD</span> will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord G<span class="caps-s">OD</span> hath spoken, who can but prophesy?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof, and the oppressed in the midst thereof.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>For they know not to do right, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord G<span class="caps-s">OD</span>; An adversary <i>there shall be</i> even round about the land; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be spoiled.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus <i>in</i> a couch.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord G<span class="caps-s">OD</span>, the God of hosts,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel: and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>

<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that <i>are</i> in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>The Lord G<span class="caps-s">OD</span> hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And ye shall go out at the breaches, every <i>cow at that which is</i> before her; and ye shall cast <i>them</i> into the palace, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, <i>and</i> your tithes after three years:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim <i>and</i> publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord G<span class="caps-s">OD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And also I have withholden the rain from you, when <i>there were</i> yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>So two <i>or</i> three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the palmerworm devoured <i>them</i>: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>I have overthrown <i>some</i> of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: <i>and</i> because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what <i>is</i> his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, The God of hosts, <i>is</i> his name.</li>

<h1>Chapter 5</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Hear ye this word which I take up against you, <i>even</i> a lamentation, O house of Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; <i>there is</i> none to raise her up.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>For thus saith the Lord G<span class="caps-s">OD</span>; The city that went out <i>by</i> a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth <i>by</i> an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>For thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Seek the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour <i>it</i>, and <i>there be</i> none to quench <i>it</i> in Bethel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><i>Seek him</i> that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> <i>is</i> his name:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Forasmuch therefore as your treading <i>is</i> upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate <i>from their right</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it <i>is</i> an evil time.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Therefore the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing <i>shall be</i> in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And in all vineyards <i>shall be</i> wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Woe unto you that desire the day of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>! to what end <i>is</i> it for you? the day of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> <i>is</i> darkness, and not light.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span><i>Shall</i> not the day of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> <i>be</i> darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept <i>them</i>: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.</li>

<h1>Chapter 7</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Thus hath the Lord G<span class="caps-s">OD</span> shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, <i>it was</i> the latter growth after the king&#8217;s mowings.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And it came to pass, <i>that</i> when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord G<span class="caps-s">OD</span>, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he <i>is</i> small.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> repented for this: It shall not be, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Thus hath the Lord G<span class="caps-s">OD</span> shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord G<span class="caps-s">OD</span> called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Then said I, O Lord G<span class="caps-s">OD</span>, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he <i>is</i> small.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord G<span class="caps-s">OD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall <i>made</i> by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it <i>is</i> the king&#8217;s chapel, and it <i>is</i> the king&#8217;s court.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I <i>was</i> no prophet, neither <i>was</i> I a prophet&#8217;s son; but I <i>was</i> an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> took me as I followed the flock, and the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Now therefore hear thou the word of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not <i>thy word</i> against the house of Isaac.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.</li>

<h1>Chapter 8</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Thus hath the Lord G<span class="caps-s">OD</span> shewed unto me: and behold a basket of summer fruit.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> unto me, The end is come upon my people of Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the Lord G<span class="caps-s">OD</span>: <i>there shall be</i> many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast <i>them</i> forth with silence.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; <i>yea</i>, and sell the refuse of the wheat?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and drowned, as <i>by</i> the flood of Egypt.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord G<span class="caps-s">OD</span>, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only <i>son</i>, and the end thereof as a bitter day.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Behold, the days come, saith the Lord G<span class="caps-s">OD</span>, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and shall not find <i>it</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O Dan, liveth; and, The manner of Beersheba liveth; even they shall fall, and never rise up again.</li>

<h1>Chapter 9</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>I saw the Lord standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And the Lord G<span class="caps-s">OD</span> of hosts <i>is</i> he that toucheth the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as <i>by</i> the flood of Egypt.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span><i>It is</i> he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> <i>is</i> his name.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span><i>Are</i> ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Behold, the eyes of the Lord G<span class="caps-s">OD</span> <i>are</i> upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as <i>corn</i> is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called by my name, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> that doeth this.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Behold, the days come, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit <i>them</i>; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> thy God.</li>
