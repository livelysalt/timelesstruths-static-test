<h1>Chapter 4</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>How is the gold become dim! <i>how</i> is the most fine gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people <i>is become</i> cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, <i>and</i> no man breaketh <i>it</i> unto them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing <i>was</i> of sapphire:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span><i>They that be</i> slain with the sword are better than <i>they that be</i> slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for <i>want of</i> the fruits of the field.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>For the sins of her prophets, <i>and</i> the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>They have wandered <i>as</i> blind <i>men</i> in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>They cried unto them, Depart ye; <i>it is</i> unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn <i>there</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>The anger of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation <i>that</i> could not save <i>us</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.</li>
