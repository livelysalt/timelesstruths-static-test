<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>How doth the city sit solitary, <i>that was</i> full of people! <i>how</i> is she become as a widow! she <i>that was</i> great among the nations, <i>and</i> princess among the provinces, <i>how</i> is she become tributary!</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears <i>are</i> on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort <i>her</i>: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she <i>is</i> in bitterness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts <i>that</i> find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, <i>and</i> did mock at her sabbaths.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Her filthiness <i>is</i> in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified <i>himself</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen <i>that</i> the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command <i>that</i> they should not enter into thy congregation.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and consider; for I am become vile.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span><i>Is it</i> nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath afflicted <i>me</i> in the day of his fierce anger.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate <i>and</i> faint all the day.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, <i>and</i> come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the Lord hath delivered me into <i>their</i> hands, <i>from whom</i> I am not able to rise up.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty <i>men</i> in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, <i>as</i> in a winepress.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>For these <i>things</i> I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Zion spreadeth forth her hands, <i>and there is</i> none to comfort her: the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath commanded concerning Jacob, <i>that</i> his adversaries <i>should be</i> round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>I called for my lovers, <i>but</i> they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve their souls.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Behold, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>; for I <i>am</i> in distress: my bowels are troubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home <i>there is</i> as death.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>They have heard that I sigh: <i>there is</i> none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done <i>it</i>: thou wilt bring the day <i>that</i> thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs <i>are</i> many, and my heart <i>is</i> faint.</li>

<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, <i>and</i> cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought <i>them</i> down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>He hath cut off in <i>his</i> fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, <i>which</i> devoureth round about.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all <i>that were</i> pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as <i>if it were of</i> a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, as in the day of a solemn feast.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes <i>are</i> among the Gentiles: the law <i>is</i> no <i>more</i>; her prophets also find no vision from the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, <i>and</i> keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>They say to their mothers, Where <i>is</i> corn and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers&#8217; bosom.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach <i>is</i> great like the sea: who can heal thee?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>All that pass by clap <i>their</i> hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, <i>saying, Is</i> this the city that <i>men</i> call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed <i>her</i> up: certainly this <i>is</i> the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen <i>it</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath done <i>that</i> which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused <i>thine</i> enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Behold, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, <i>and</i> children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain <i>them</i> in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, <i>and</i> not pitied.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD&#8217;S</span> anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>He hath builded against me, and compassed <i>me</i> with gall and travail.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>He hath set me in dark places, as <i>they that be</i> dead of old.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>For the sins of her prophets, <i>and</i> the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>They have wandered <i>as</i> blind <i>men</i> in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>They cried unto them, Depart ye; <i>it is</i> unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn <i>there</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>The anger of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation <i>that</i> could not save <i>us</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.</li>

<h1>Chapter 5</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Remember, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers <i>are</i> as widows.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Our necks <i>are</i> under persecution: we labour, <i>and</i> have no rest.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>We have given the hand <i>to</i> the Egyptians, <i>and to</i> the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Our fathers have sinned, <i>and are</i> not; and we have borne their iniquities.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Servants have ruled over us: <i>there is</i> none that doth deliver <i>us</i> out of their hand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>We gat our bread with <i>the peril of</i> our lives because of the sword of the wilderness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>They ravished the women in Zion, <i>and</i> the maids in the cities of Judah.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>The crown is fallen <i>from</i> our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned!</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>For this our heart is faint; for these <i>things</i> our eyes are dim.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>Thou, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, <i>and</i> forsake us so long time?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Turn thou us unto thee, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.</li>
