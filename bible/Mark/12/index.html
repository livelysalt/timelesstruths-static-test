<h1>Chapter 12</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And he began to speak unto them by parables. <span class="KJV_Jesus">A <i>certain</i> man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about <i>it</i>, and digged <i>a place for</i> the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And they caught <i>him</i>, and beat him, and sent <i>him</i> away empty.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded <i>him</i> in the head, and sent <i>him</i> away shamefully handled.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And they took him, and killed <i>him</i>, and cast <i>him</i> out of the vineyard.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">This was the Lord&#8217;s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in <i>his</i> words.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see <i>it</i>.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And they brought <i>it</i>. And he saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Whose <i>is</i> this image and superscription?</span> And they said unto him, Caesar&#8217;s.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answering said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar&#8217;s, and to God the things that are God&#8217;s.</span> And they marvelled at him.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man&#8217;s brother die, and leave <i>his</i> wife <i>behind him</i>, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answering said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I <i>am</i> the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answered him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">The first of all the commandments <i>is</i>, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this <i>is</i> the first commandment.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And the second <i>is</i> like, <i>namely</i> this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love <i>his</i> neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Thou art not far from the kingdom of God.</span> And no man after that durst ask him <i>any question</i>.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, <span class="KJV_Jesus">How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he <i>then</i> his son?</span> And the common people heard him gladly.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And he said unto them in his doctrine, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and <i>love</i> salutations in the marketplaces,</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Which devour widows&#8217; houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span>And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span>And he called <i>unto him</i> his disciples, and saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For all <i>they</i> did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, <i>even</i> all her living.</span></li>
