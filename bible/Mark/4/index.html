<h1>Chapter 4</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all <i>these</i> things are done in parables:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and <i>their</i> sins should be forgiven them.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>The sower soweth the word.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word&#8217;s sake, immediately they are offended.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive <i>it</i>, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And he said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And he said, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus"><i>It is</i> like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear <i>it</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Let us pass over unto the other side.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span>And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Peace, be still.</span> And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span>And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</li>
