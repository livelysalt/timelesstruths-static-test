<h1>Chapter 15</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried <i>him</i> away, and delivered <i>him</i> to Pilate.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Thou sayest <i>it</i>.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now at <i>that</i> feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And there was <i>one</i> named Barabbas, <i>which lay</i> bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And the multitude crying aloud began to desire <i>him to do</i> as he had ever done unto them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do <i>unto him</i> whom ye call the King of the Jews?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And they cried out again, Crucify him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And <i>so</i> Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged <i>him</i>, to be crucified.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his <i>head</i>,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing <i>their</i> knees worshipped him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received <i>it</i> not.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest <i>it</i> in three days,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>Save thyself, and come down from the cross.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?</span> which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>And some of them that stood by, when they heard <i>it</i>, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put <i>it</i> on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span>There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span>(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span>Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span>And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling <i>unto him</i> the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span>And when he knew <i>it</i> of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">46&nbsp;</span>And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">47&nbsp;</span>And Mary Magdalene and Mary <i>the mother</i> of Joses beheld where he was laid.</li>
