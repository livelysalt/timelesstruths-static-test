<h1>Chapter 7</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash <i>their</i> hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And <i>when they come</i> from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, <i>as</i> the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>He answered and said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with <i>their</i> lips, but their heart is far from me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching <i>for</i> doctrines the commandments of men.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, <i>as</i> the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, <i>It is</i> Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; <i>he shall be free</i>.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And when he had called all the people <i>unto him</i>, he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Hearken unto me every one <i>of you</i>, and understand:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And he saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, <i>it</i> cannot defile him;</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know <i>it</i>: but he could not be hid.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>For a <i>certain</i> woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children&#8217;s bread, and to cast <i>it</i> unto the dogs.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children&#8217;s crumbs.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>And he said unto her, <span class="KJV_Jesus">For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Ephphatha,</span> that is, Be opened.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span>And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published <i>it</i>;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</li>
