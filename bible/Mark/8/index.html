<h1>Chapter 8</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples <i>unto him</i>, and saith unto them,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these <i>men</i> with bread here in the wilderness?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And he asked them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">How many loaves have ye?</span> And they said, Seven.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before <i>them</i>; and they did set <i>them</i> before the people.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before <i>them</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken <i>meat</i> that was left seven baskets.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now <i>the disciples</i> had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And he charged them, saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and <i>of</i> the leaven of Herod.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, <i>It is</i> because we have no bread.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And when Jesus knew <i>it</i>, he saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?</span> They say unto him, Twelve.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?</span> And they said, Seven.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">How is it that ye do not understand?</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>After that he put <i>his</i> hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>And he sent him away to his house, saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Neither go into the town, nor tell <i>it</i> to any in the town.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Whom do men say that I am?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>And they answered, John the Baptist: but some <i>say</i>, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>And he saith unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">But whom say ye that I am?</span> And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and <i>of</i> the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span>And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And when he had called the people <i>unto him</i> with his disciples also, he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel&#8217;s, the same shall save it.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_Jesus">Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</span></li>
