<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And John was clothed with camel&#8217;s hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>And there came a voice from heaven, <i>saying</i>, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>And saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.</span></li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the <i>son</i> of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>Saying, Let <i>us</i> alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine <i>is</i> this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">30&nbsp;</span>But Simon&#8217;s wife&#8217;s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">31&nbsp;</span>And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">32&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">33&nbsp;</span>And all the city was gathered together at the door.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">34&nbsp;</span>And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">35&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">36&nbsp;</span>And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">37&nbsp;</span>And when they had found him, they said unto him, All <i>men</i> seek for thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">38&nbsp;</span>And he said unto them, <span class="KJV_Jesus">Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">39&nbsp;</span>And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.</li>

</ul>
<ul class="KJV">
<li><span class="KJV_num">40&nbsp;</span><span class="KJV_para">&#182; </span>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">41&nbsp;</span>And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth <i>his</i> hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">I will; be thou clean.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">42&nbsp;</span>And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">43&nbsp;</span>And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">44&nbsp;</span>And saith unto him, <span class="KJV_Jesus">See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</span></li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">45&nbsp;</span>But he went out, and began to publish <i>it</i> much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</li>
