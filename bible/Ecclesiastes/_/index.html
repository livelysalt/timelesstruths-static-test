<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all <i>is</i> vanity.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span><i>One</i> generation passeth away, and <i>another</i> generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea <i>is</i> not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>All things <i>are</i> full of labour; man cannot utter <i>it</i>: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>The thing that hath been, it <i>is that</i> which shall be; and that which is done <i>is</i> that which shall be done: and <i>there is</i> no new <i>thing</i> under the sun.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Is there <i>any</i> thing whereof it may be said, See, this <i>is</i> new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span><i>There is</i> no remembrance of former <i>things</i>; neither shall there be <i>any</i> remembrance of <i>things</i> that are to come with <i>those</i> that shall come after.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all <i>things</i> that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all <i>is</i> vanity and vexation of spirit.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span><i>That which is</i> crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all <i>they</i> that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>For in much wisdom <i>is</i> much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</li>

<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also <i>is</i> vanity.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>I said of laughter, <i>It is</i> mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what <i>was</i> that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all <i>kind of</i> fruits:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>I got <i>me</i> servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, <i>as</i> musical instruments, and that of all sorts.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all <i>was</i> vanity and vexation of spirit, and <i>there was</i> no profit under the sun.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what <i>can</i> the man <i>do</i> that cometh after the king? <i>even</i> that which hath been already done.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>The wise man&#8217;s eyes <i>are</i> in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also <i>is</i> vanity.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>For <i>there is</i> no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now <i>is</i> in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise <i>man</i>? as the fool.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun <i>is</i> grievous unto me: for all <i>is</i> vanity and vexation of spirit.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise <i>man</i> or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This <i>is</i> also vanity.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>For there is a man whose labour <i>is</i> in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it <i>for</i> his portion. This also <i>is</i> vanity and a great evil.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>For all his days <i>are</i> sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span><i>There is</i> nothing better for a man, <i>than</i> that he should eat and drink, and <i>that</i> he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it <i>was</i> from the hand of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>For who can eat, or who else can hasten <i>hereunto</i>, more than I?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>For <i>God</i> giveth to a man that <i>is</i> good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to <i>him that is</i> good before God. This also <i>is</i> vanity and vexation of spirit.</li>

<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>To every <i>thing there is</i> a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up <i>that which is</i> planted;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>He hath made every <i>thing</i> beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>I know that <i>there is</i> no good in them, but for <i>a man</i> to rejoice, and to do good in his life.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it <i>is</i> the gift of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth <i>it</i>, that <i>men</i> should fear before him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, <i>that</i> wickedness <i>was</i> there; and the place of righteousness, <i>that</i> iniquity <i>was</i> there.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for <i>there is</i> a time there for every purpose and for every work.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all <i>is</i> vanity.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>Wherefore I perceive that <i>there is</i> nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that <i>is</i> his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</li>

<h1>Chapter 4</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of <i>such as were</i> oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors <i>there was</i> power; but they had no comforter.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Yea, better <i>is he</i> than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This <i>is</i> also vanity and vexation of spirit.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Better <i>is</i> an handful <i>with</i> quietness, than both the hands full <i>with</i> travail and vexation of spirit.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>There is one <i>alone</i>, and <i>there is</i> not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet <i>is there</i> no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither <i>saith he</i>, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This <i>is</i> also vanity, yea, it <i>is</i> a sore travail.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Two <i>are</i> better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him <i>that is</i> alone when he falleth; for <i>he hath</i> not another to help him up.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm <i>alone</i>?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Better <i>is</i> a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also <i>he that is</i> born in his kingdom becometh poor.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span><i>There is</i> no end of all the people, <i>even</i> of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also <i>is</i> vanity and vexation of spirit.</li>

<h1>Chapter 5</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter <i>any</i> thing before God: for God <i>is</i> in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool&#8217;s voice <i>is known</i> by multitude of words.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for <i>he hath</i> no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Better <i>is it</i> that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it <i>was</i> an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>For in the multitude of dreams and many words <i>there are</i> also <i>divers</i> vanities: but fear thou God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for <i>he that is</i> higher than the highest regardeth; and <i>there be</i> higher than they.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king <i>himself</i> is served by the field.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this <i>is</i> also vanity.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good <i>is there</i> to the owners thereof, saving the beholding <i>of them</i> with their eyes?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>The sleep of a labouring man <i>is</i> sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>There is a sore evil <i>which</i> I have seen under the sun, <i>namely</i>, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and <i>there is</i> nothing in his hand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>As he came forth of his mother&#8217;s womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>And this also <i>is</i> a sore evil, <i>that</i> in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>All his days also he eateth in darkness, and <i>he hath</i> much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Behold <i>that</i> which I have seen: <i>it is</i> good and comely <i>for one</i> to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it <i>is</i> his portion.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this <i>is</i> the gift of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth <i>him</i> in the joy of his heart.</li>

<h1>Chapter 6</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it <i>is</i> common among men:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this <i>is</i> vanity, and it <i>is</i> an evil disease.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>If a man beget an hundred <i>children</i>, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also <i>that</i> he have no burial; I say, <i>that</i> an untimely birth <i>is</i> better than he.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known <i>any thing</i>: this hath more rest than the other.</li>

<h1>Chapter 7</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>A good name <i>is</i> better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one&#8217;s birth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span><i>It is</i> better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that <i>is</i> the end of all men; and the living will lay <i>it</i> to his heart.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Sorrow <i>is</i> better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>The heart of the wise <i>is</i> in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools <i>is</i> in the house of mirth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span><i>It is</i> better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so <i>is</i> the laughter of the fool: this also <i>is</i> vanity.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Better <i>is</i> the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: <i>and</i> the patient in spirit <i>is</i> better than the proud in spirit.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Say not thou, What is <i>the cause</i> that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Wisdom <i>is</i> good with an inheritance: and <i>by it there is</i> profit to them that see the sun.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>For wisdom <i>is</i> a defence, <i>and</i> money <i>is</i> a defence: but the excellency of knowledge <i>is, that</i> wisdom giveth life to them that have it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Consider the work of God: for who can make <i>that</i> straight, which he hath made crooked?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>All <i>things</i> have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just <i>man</i> that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked <i>man</i> that prolongeth <i>his life</i> in his wickedness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span><i>It is</i> good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty <i>men</i> which are in the city.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>For <i>there is</i> not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">21&nbsp;</span>Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">22&nbsp;</span>For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">23&nbsp;</span>All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it <i>was</i> far from me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">24&nbsp;</span>That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">25&nbsp;</span>I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason <i>of things</i>, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness <i>and</i> madness:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">26&nbsp;</span>And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart <i>is</i> snares and nets, <i>and</i> her hands <i>as</i> bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">27&nbsp;</span>Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, <i>counting</i> one by one, to find out the account:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">28&nbsp;</span>Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">29&nbsp;</span>Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.</li>

<h1>Chapter 8</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Who <i>is</i> as the wise <i>man</i>? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man&#8217;s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>I <i>counsel thee</i> to keep the king&#8217;s commandment, and <i>that</i> in regard of the oath of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Where the word of a king <i>is, there is</i> power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man&#8217;s heart discerneth both time and judgment.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man <i>is</i> great upon him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span><i>There is</i> no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither <i>hath he</i> power in the day of death: and <i>there is</i> no discharge in <i>that</i> war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: <i>there is</i> a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this <i>is</i> also vanity.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his <i>days</i> be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong <i>his</i> days, <i>which are</i> as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just <i>men</i>, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked <i>men</i>, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also <i>is</i> vanity.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also <i>there is that</i> neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek <i>it</i> out, yet he shall not find <i>it</i>; yea further; though a wise <i>man</i> think to know <i>it</i>, yet shall he not be able to find <i>it</i>.</li>

<h1>Chapter 9</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, <i>are</i> in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred <i>by</i> all <i>that is</i> before them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>All <i>things come</i> alike to all: <i>there is</i> one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as <i>is</i> the good, so <i>is</i> the sinner; <i>and</i> he that sweareth, as <i>he</i> that feareth an oath.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>This <i>is</i> an evil among all <i>things</i> that are done under the sun, that <i>there is</i> one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness <i>is</i> in their heart while they live, and after that <i>they go</i> to the dead.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any <i>thing</i> that is done under the sun.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that <i>is</i> thy portion in <i>this</i> life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do <i>it</i> with thy might; for <i>there is</i> no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race <i>is</i> not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so <i>are</i> the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it <i>seemed</i> great unto me:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span><i>There was</i> a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Then said I, Wisdom <i>is</i> better than strength: nevertheless the poor man&#8217;s wisdom <i>is</i> despised, and his words are not heard.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>The words of wise <i>men are</i> heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Wisdom <i>is</i> better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good.</li>

<h1>Chapter 10</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: <i>so doth</i> a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom <i>and</i> honour.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>A wise man&#8217;s heart <i>is</i> at his right hand; but a fool&#8217;s heart at his left.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth <i>him</i>, and he saith to every one <i>that</i> he <i>is</i> a fool.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>There is an evil <i>which</i> I have seen under the sun, as an error <i>which</i> proceedeth from the ruler:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; <i>and</i> he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom <i>is</i> profitable to direct.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>The words of a wise man&#8217;s mouth <i>are</i> gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>The beginning of the words of his mouth <i>is</i> foolishness: and the end of his talk <i>is</i> mischievous madness.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Woe to thee, O land, when thy king <i>is</i> a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Blessed <i>art</i> thou, O land, when thy king <i>is</i> the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all <i>things</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>If the clouds be full of rain, they empty <i>themselves</i> upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all <i>is</i> vanity.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, <i>and</i> set in order many proverbs.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and <i>that which was</i> written <i>was</i> upright, <i>even</i> words of truth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>The words of the wise <i>are</i> as goads, and as nails fastened <i>by</i> the masters of assemblies, <i>which</i> are given from one shepherd.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books <i>there is</i> no end; and much study <i>is</i> a weariness of the flesh.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this <i>is</i> the whole <i>duty</i> of man.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether <i>it be</i> good, or whether <i>it be</i> evil.</li>
