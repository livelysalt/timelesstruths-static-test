<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! <i>even</i> cry out unto thee <i>of</i> violence, and thou wilt not save!</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause <i>me</i> to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence <i>are</i> before me: and there are <i>that</i> raise up strife and contention.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for <i>I</i> will work a work in your days, <i>which</i> ye will not believe, though it be told <i>you</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, <i>that</i> bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces <i>that are</i> not theirs.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>They <i>are</i> terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle <i>that</i> hasteth to eat.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up <i>as</i> the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Then shall <i>his</i> mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, <i>imputing</i> this his power unto his god.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span><i>Art</i> thou not from everlasting, O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span><i>Thou art</i> of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, <i>and</i> holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth <i>the man that is</i> more righteous than he?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, <i>that have</i> no ruler over them?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion <i>is</i> fat, and their meat plenteous.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?</li>

<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make <i>it</i> plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>For the vision <i>is</i> yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Behold, his soul <i>which</i> is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, <i>he is</i> a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and <i>is</i> as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth <i>that which is</i> not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men&#8217;s blood, and <i>for</i> the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned <i>against</i> thy soul.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity!</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Behold, <i>is it</i> not of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, as the waters cover the sea.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to <i>him</i>, and makest <i>him</i> drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD&#8217;S</span> right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing <i>shall be</i> on thy glory.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, <i>which</i> made them afraid, because of men&#8217;s blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it <i>is</i> laid over with gold and silver, and <i>there is</i> no breath at all in the midst of it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">20&nbsp;</span>But the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> <i>is</i> in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.</li>

<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, I have heard thy speech, <i>and</i> was afraid: O L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And <i>his</i> brightness was as the light; he had horns <i>coming</i> out of his hand: and there <i>was</i> the hiding of his power.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways <i>are</i> everlasting.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: <i>and</i> the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Was the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> displeased against the rivers? <i>was</i> thine anger against the rivers? <i>was</i> thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses <i>and</i> thy chariots of salvation?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Thy bow was made quite naked, <i>according</i> to the oaths of the tribes, <i>even thy</i> word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>The mountains saw thee, <i>and</i> they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, <i>and</i> lifted up his hands on high.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>The sun <i>and</i> moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, <i>and</i> at the shining of thy glittering spear.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, <i>even</i> for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing <i>was</i> as to devour the poor secretly.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, <i>through</i> the heap of great waters.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">17&nbsp;</span>Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither <i>shall</i> fruit <i>be</i> in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and <i>there shall be</i> no herd in the stalls:</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">18&nbsp;</span>Yet I will rejoice in the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, I will joy in the God of my salvation.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">19&nbsp;</span>The L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> God <i>is</i> my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds&#8217; <i>feet</i>, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.</li>
