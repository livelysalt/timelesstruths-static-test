<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>The word of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, <i>and</i> Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord G<span class="caps-s">OD</span> be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>For, behold, the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, <i>and</i> as the waters <i>that are</i> poured down a steep place.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>For the transgression of Jacob <i>is</i> all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What <i>is</i> the transgression of Jacob? <i>is it</i> not Samaria? and what <i>are</i> the high places of Judah? <i>are they</i> not Jerusalem?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, <i>and</i> as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered <i>it</i> of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>For her wound <i>is</i> incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, <i>even</i> to Jerusalem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Declare ye <i>it</i> not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> unto the gate of Jerusalem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she <i>is</i> the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib <i>shall be</i> a lie to the kings of Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.</li>

<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And they covet fields, and take <i>them</i> by violence; and houses, and take <i>them</i> away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time <i>is</i> evil.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>In that day shall <i>one</i> take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, <i>and</i> say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed <i>it</i> from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Prophesy ye not, <i>say they to them that</i> prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, <i>that</i> they shall not take shame.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>O <i>thou that art</i> named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> straitened? <i>are</i> these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Arise ye, and depart; for this <i>is</i> not <i>your</i> rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy <i>you</i>, even with a sore destruction.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, <i>saying</i>, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of <i>the multitude of</i> men.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> on the head of them.</li>

<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; <i>Is it</i> not for you to know judgment?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>Then shall they cry unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>Thus saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Therefore night <i>shall be</i> unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for <i>there is</i> no answer of God.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and say, <i>Is</i> not the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> among us? none evil can come upon us.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed <i>as</i> a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.</li>

<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>But in the last days it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> the mountain of the house of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> from Jerusalem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make <i>them</i> afraid: for the mouth of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> of hosts hath spoken <i>it</i>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> our God for ever and ever.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>In that day, saith the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">9&nbsp;</span>Now why dost thou cry out aloud? <i>is there</i> no king in thee? is thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">10&nbsp;</span>Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go <i>even</i> to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>But they know not the thoughts of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, <i>though</i> thou be little among the thousands of Judah, <i>yet</i> out of thee shall he come forth unto me <i>that is</i> to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth <i>have been</i> from of old, from everlasting.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>Therefore will he give them up, until the time <i>that</i> she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>And this <i>man</i> shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver <i>us</i> from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.</li>

<h1>Chapter 6</h1>
<ul class="KJV"><li><span class="KJV_num">1&nbsp;</span>Hear ye now what the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">2&nbsp;</span>Hear ye, O mountains, the L<span class="caps-s">ORD&#8217;S</span> controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">4&nbsp;</span>For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">5&nbsp;</span>O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">6&nbsp;</span>Wherewith shall I come before the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span>, <i>and</i> bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">7&nbsp;</span>Will the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> be pleased with thousands of rams, <i>or</i> with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn <i>for</i> my transgression, the fruit of my body <i>for</i> the sin of my soul?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">8&nbsp;</span>He hath shewed thee, O man, what <i>is</i> good; and what doth the L<span class="caps-s">ORD</span> require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">11&nbsp;</span>Shall I count <i>them</i> pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">12&nbsp;</span>For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue <i>is</i> deceitful in their mouth.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">13&nbsp;</span>Therefore also will I make <i>thee</i> sick in smiting thee, in making <i>thee</i> desolate because of thy sins.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">14&nbsp;</span>Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down <i>shall be</i> in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and <i>that</i> which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">15&nbsp;</span>Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine.</li>
<li><span class="KJV_num">16&nbsp;</span>For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.</li>

<li><span class="KJV_num">3&nbsp;</span>That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge <i>asketh</i> for a reward; and the great <i>man</i>, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.</li>
