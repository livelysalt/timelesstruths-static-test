<h1>A Bit About Browsers</h1>

<p>As you probably know, there are many browsers and browser versions in use today. Naturally, with such a diverse group, there&#8217;s bound to be compatibility problems.  As I don&#8217;t have the time to make this site work perfectly on every browser, I&#8217;ve settled for trying to make this work <i>almost</i> perfectly on the main ones.</p>

<p>Note that, with a few unavoidable exceptions, this site has been build according to web standards, and should be <i>accessible</i> in all browsers. However, it may not look that nice in sub-standard broswers, and you may want to upgrade if this is the case.</p>

<p>This site has been tested to work with tolerable accuracy of display and function on the following browsers for Windows:</p>

<ul>
<li><a class="red" href="http://microsoft.com/windows/ie/">Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5</a> and higher</li>

<li><a class="red" href="http://mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox 0.7</a> and higher</li>

<li><a class="red" href="http://channels.netscape.com/ns/browsers/">Netscape Navigator 6</a> and higher</li>

<li><a class="red" href="http://opera.com">Opera 7</a> and higher</li>

</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been told it works fine on <a class="red" href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/ie/">Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.1 for Mac OS 9</a>.</p>

<p>Continuing on in this tutorial, when I refer to a certain browser, such as Internet Explorer, I&#8217;ll be referring to the versions that I&#8217;ve tested it on.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../help/More_Help/Text_and_Screen_Sizes/index.html">Text and Screen Sizes</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Text and Screen Sizes</h1>

<p>At this time, the only way to customize the site is with the browser. Which means that, unless you change the settings again, after leaving, many other sites will appear differently as well.</p>

<p>Each browser differs in how it changes the site. Internet Explorer enables you to change the size of certain text. On this site, that text includes all the main text, not including the top or sidebars.  In Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, the text size can be changed by going to <i>View</i> &gt; <i>Text Size</i> (<i>Text Zoom</i> in Netscape Navigator 7.x), and choosing one of the options. The Opera browser, however, doesn&#8217;t merely change the text size: by selecting an option in <i>View</i> &gt; <i>Zoom</i>, the entire site will be resized. The downside of this is that, if you want large text, and don&#8217;t have a large screen, you will have to scroll horizontally to view everything.</p>

<p>This site was designed to be viewed on a screen optimally set to 800 x 600 or larger. This means that if your screen is set to 800 x 600, the site will nearly fill the browser (when maximized), if you don&#8217;t have any sidebars showing. If you have a small screen, such as 640 x 480, the site will compress, and it may not look quite so nice, but you shouldn&#8217;t have to scroll horizontally. And there&#8217;s a smaller score zoom setting to fit the sheet music on a smaller screen.</p>

<h1>Saving Documents</h1>

<p>If you&#8217;ve read
<a href="../../../help/Basic_Navigation/index.html">Basic Navigation</a>,
you&#8217;ll know about changing to Whole Document mode. Viewing the whole document is useful if you like to read one long text, or for printing or saving the entire document.</p>

<p>To save a document, click <i>File</i> &gt; <i>Save As&#8230;&#8203;</i> in your browser (<i>Save Page As&#8230;&#8203;</i> in Netscape Navigator 7.x and Mozilla Firefox).  Depending on the browser, you can save it in different formats.  Also, you&#8217;ll probably want to name the file something other than the default name the browser chooses. If the browser doesn&#8217;t suggest any name (such as in Netscape Navigator 6.x), make sure you add the extension &#8220;.htm&#8221; or &#8220;.html&#8221;; otherwise it won&#8217;t work when you look at it later. Note that, depending on the browser, and the options you chose when you saved it, the pictures and links may or may not work correctly.</p>

<p>Other than directly saving a document with the browser, you can also select any of the text and copy it to your word processor.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../help/More_Help/Searching_Documents/index.html">Searching Documents</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Searching Documents</h1>

<p>Our full library search is currently powered by Google, and you should usually be able to find what you&#8217;re looking for if we have it. It is not quite complete, however, as Google does not search the entire site, and doesn&#8217;t always include the most recent items.</p>

<p>Optionally, you can use your browser search function to find something in a document. Navigate to the document you would like to search, and switch to Whole Document mode. Then go to <i>Edit</i> &gt; <i>Find&#8230;&#8203;</i> (or <i>Find on This Page&#8230;&#8203;</i>, depending on the browser)&#8212;or press Ctrl+F&#8212;and enter the text you&#8217;d like to search for.</p>

<p>We currently have our own search engine enabled for our Bible and Music departments. This may be found on the left panel of our <a href="../../../search/index.html">Search</a> page, below the Google search. It&#8217;s not very advanced, but should be able to help you quickly find what you&#8217;re looking for. Note that this search will find any matches within words: if you search for <b>way</b>, you will get results such as al<b>way</b>s or s<b>way</b>. To look for an exact phrase, put quotes around it. In music queries, you can restrict the search to titles by using the <b>title:</b> keyword.</p>

<p>Sample Bible queries:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../search/?query=bible&amp;q=John 3:16">John 3:16</a></li>

<li><a href="../../../search/?query=bible&amp;q=Psa 22:26; Mt. 5:5">Psa 22:26; Mt. 5:5</a></li>

<li><a href="../../../search/?query=bible&amp;q=Job chapter one verse one">Job chapter one verse one</a></li>

<li><a href="../../../search/?query=bible&amp;q=trust in the Lord">trust in the Lord</a></li>

<li><a href="../../../search/?query=bible&amp;q=%22I am the way%22">&#8220;I am the way&#8221;</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Sample Music queries:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../search/?query=music&amp;q=God's way">God&#8217;s way</a></li>

<li><a href="../../../search/?query=music&amp;q=%22God's way%22 is best">&#8220;God&#8217;s way&#8221; is best</a></li>

<li><a href="../../../search/?query=music&amp;q=prayer">prayer</a></li>

<li><a href="../../../search/?query=music&amp;q=title:alone">title:alone</a></li>

</ul>

<h1>Paperdolls&#8212;Acrobat and Printing</h1>

<p>In nearly every issue of
<a class="green" href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom/_/issue_index.html" title="Treasures of the Kingdom">Treasures of the Kingdom</a> we feature a paperdoll item to go with &#8220;Little Princess.&#8221;</p>

<p>To print out the paperdoll, you will need the free 
<a class="red" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">Acrobat Reader</a>, which you probably already have.
With the reader installed, you can download the paperdolls and accessories, such as
<a class="green" href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom_1/Letter_to_a_Little_Princess/index.html" title="Treasures of the Kingdom 1/Letter to a Little Princess">Princess Precious and gown</a>.
They will open up in the browser window with the reader plugin, and you can print them out or save them. When printing, be sure to set the scale to 100%, so they will turn out the right size.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../help/More_Help/Music_Formats/index.html">Music Formats</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Music Formats</h1>

<p>If any of the songs have scores available, they will be listed in the left panel, below the song lyrics information; for example:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="../../More_Help/example_music.gif" alt="" width="720" height="385" /></div>
<p><img style="vertical-align:middle;" src="../../../assets3/link_score.gif" alt="" width="22" height="22" /> For playing the sheet music, see <a href="../../../help/More_Help/Sheet_Music_Scorch_Plugin/index.html">Sheet Music&#8212;Scorch Plugin</a>.</p>

<p><img style="vertical-align:middle;" src="../../../assets3/link_midi.gif" alt="" width="22" height="22" /> Playing MIDI in the browser requires a plugin, which usually comes with your browser. If not, try <a class="red" href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">Apple QuickTime</a> or <a class="red" href="http://www.real.com/">Real Player</a>.</p>

<p>Some songs also have voice recordings (such as <a class="green" href="../../../music/Fire_in_the_Soul/index.html">Fire in the Soul</a>, shown above).</p>

<p><img style="vertical-align:middle;" src="../../../assets3/link_hifi.gif" alt="" width="22" height="22" /> For the best quality (usually 128 kbps) recording, click the &#8220;Play high quality mp3&#8221; button. These files require the most bandwidth.</p>

<p><img style="vertical-align:middle;" src="../../../assets3/link_lofi.gif" alt="" width="22" height="22" /> If you have a dial-up modem, you can click the &#8220;Play dial-up quality mp3&#8221; button: these files generally run at 32 kbps. They usually don&#8217;t sound too good, but they may be useful.</p>

<p><img style="vertical-align:middle;" src="../../../assets3/link_lowm.gif" alt="" width="22" height="22" /> If possible, try the dial-up quality Windows Media Audio file. This is designed for playing over the internet, streaming at 22 kbps. The quality is much better than the 32 kbps mp3. However, most folks will only be able to use it with Internet Explorer on Windows.</p>

<p>To download and save the song on your computer, right-click one of the download links and select <i>Save Target As&#8230;&#8203;</i> (or something similar to that) from the menu. Remember where you&#8217;ve saved it, and you can then play it any time you like. For those of you who have slow connections to the internet, saving a high quality recording can take several minutes.</p>

<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../help/More_Help/Sheet_Music_Scorch_Plugin/index.html">Sheet Music&#8212;Scorch Plugin</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Sheet Music&#8212;Scorch Plugin</h1>

<p>In order for you to access the sheet music, you will have to
<a class="red" href="http://www.sibelius.com/cgi-bin/download/get.pl?com=sh&prod=scorch">download the free Scorch plugin</a> from Sibelius. This could take up to a couple minutes on a slow connection. When they ask you to register, you may or may not have to enter any personal information&#8212;just agree to the terms of use. (Note that the Internet Explorer plugin works the best, as some of the versions for other browsers won&#8217;t display properly at certain settings.)</p>

<p><b>Important note for Mozilla browsers:</b> when installing the plugin, select the Manually Choose Browser Directory option on the first page.</p>

<p>Now, with the plugin installed, you can see the sheet music, such as
<a class="green" href="../../../music/The_Evening_Light/score/index.html">The Evening Light</a>, and even play and print the song. The <a class="red" href="http://www.sibelius.com/products/scorch/">Scorch page</a> at Sibelius tells how to use the features of the sheet music plugin.</p>

<p>There are a couple extra settings available just above the sheet music: zoom and notehead type. In order for these to work, you will need to have cookies enabled for your browser. The site will remember the last settings you picked, and keep them for whatever score you view.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../help/More_Help/Music_Player/index.html">Music Player</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Music Player</h1>

<p>The Music Player is a special feature of the site, designed to work sort of like a regular media player. It will play through all the available MIDI or MP3 files in the Library. So far we have more than 900 MIDI files, and about six hours of MP3 audio.</p>

<p>To open the Player, go to the <a class="green" href="../../../music/index.html" title="">Music home page</a>, and down near the bottom right, in a green box, is a link to the Music Player. (The player requires Javascript to operate some of its more advanced features, such as automatically continuing to the next song.) With Javascript on, the Music Player link will open up a small browser window showing the Player home page. You can return to this home page any time by clicking the Home link. Note that the Music Player also requires <a class="red" href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer">Flash Player</a> 6 or greater to play the mp3 files.</p>

<p>The dropdown lists display all the tunes available for each type. Select the one you&#8217;d like to start with, and click Play. This will take you to the song, displaying some information about it, and the file should begin playing within a few seconds.</p>

<p>For the MIDI files, a timer is set to automatically take you to the next song when the current one is finished. If you have a slow connection, and the MIDI file takes awhile to load, the Player might cut the song short, and take you to the next song before the current one is done. That&#8217;s what the delay setting on the MIDI page is for. Specify the number of seconds you&#8217;d like to add to the time for playing each song.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also a shortcut to the Player. When you&#8217;re at a MIDI or MP3 page of a song (or the main lyrics page of a song that has the MIDI available), add <b>?musicplayer</b> to the end of the url in the address bar, and it&#8217;ll jump right to that song in the Player. For example:</p>

<p><a class="green" href="../../../music/Take_Time_to_Be_Holy/?musicplayer">/music/Take_Time_to_Be_Holy/?musicplayer</a></p>

<p>This will play the MIDI by default; you can specify <b>?musicplayer=mp3</b> to play the MP3 file. However, if you use this method, the Music Player will then be in the main browser window, and might not look as good.</p>

<h1>Reporting Errors</h1>

<p>Ah, yes! Perhaps you thought I&#8217;d forgotten about this one. But why else would I put it up there in plain view on the navigation bar? (Other than because it looks good.) Because, like was stated at the start of the help page, there will likely be mistakes on the site. Just so that we can be as accurate as possible, would you mind clicking that link and sending us a report of any errors you see? It would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>May God bless you as you explore His timeless truths!</p>
