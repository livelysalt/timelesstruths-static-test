<h1>Click Here to Begin</h1>

<p>Again, welcome! We&#8217;re pleased to have you as a visitor to this site; after all, it was designed with your benefit in mind. So that you may obtain the most benefit possible, I&#8217;d like you to follow along as I show you the features of this site.</p>

<p>First off, let&#8217;s study the document navigation bars, immediately above and below. In every document that is divided into sections, this bar will appear&#8212;at the top and bottom of the sections. You may click
<a href="../../../help/Basic_Navigation/index.html">&lt;&lt</a>
to go back to the previous page (in this case, it will take you to the table of contents), or
<a href="../../../help/Basic_Navigation/Document_Navigation/index.html">&gt;&gt;</a>
to the next page. If either of those links become dark, it means you have reached either the beginning or end of the document. For now, let us continue on to the next page by clicking one of the Next Page links, and we&#8217;ll talk about other kinds of navigating. (If you hover over the link, a little popup will tell you the title of the next page&#8212;in this case it says <b>Next Page | Document Navigation</b>.)</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../help/Basic_Navigation/Document_Navigation/index.html">Document Navigation</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Document Navigation</h1>

<p>Having shown you how to navigate &#8220;foward and back&#8221; in a document, I&#8217;ll now tell about the other navigation options. Every document divided into sections includes a table of contents page&#8212;what you saw when you first came to this tutorial, and a &#8220;document header,&#8221; which is just above the top navigation bar, and has a bunch of information. On the left side is shown the title (which is a link to the table of contents) and author of the document, which here is <b>Basic Navigation</b> by the <b>Timeless Truths Webmaster</b> (that&#8217;s me, you know). And on the far right is listed the main subject of the document.</p>

<p>Now back to the navigation bar: on the left side we have a drop-down menu, which is like a compact table of contents. However, in this list we have an extra option: <b>Whole Document</b>. That&#8217;s for if you want to see everything on one page, instead of one section at a time.</p>

<p>For now, go back to the table of contents (use the title link in the header to get there quickly), and look at the information in the bar on the left side. Listed there will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>the title</li>

<li>an icon representing the document</li>

<li>the author (usually followed by the year it was written or published, if known)</li>

<li>a link to copyright license or public domain notice</li>

<li>the main subject</li>

<li>the year we published the text</li>

<li>the date the document was last edited</li>

<li>and usually an excerpt from the document</li>

</ul>


<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../help/Basic_Navigation/Site_Navigation/index.html">Site Navigation</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Site Navigation</h1>

<p>I&#8217;ve told you how to navigate through an individual document; now let&#8217;s look at navigating through the main sections of the site.</p>

<p>At the top of each page, running below the Timeless Truths banner, is the site navigation bar, which has tabs to all the main areas of the site.</p>

<p>On the right we have the Library departments: each of those contain categories, and each category contains document items.</p>

<p>On the left are the site user resources.
<a href="../../../about/index.html">About Us</a> tells some about who we are, and how to contact us. And the
<a href="../../../search/index.html">Search</a> page includes the directory to all the main resources, departments, and categories on the site.
<a href="../../../help/index.html">Help</a> is the department you are in now.</p>

<p><a href="../../../index.html">Welcome</a> takes you back to the welcome page. Clicking on the Timeless Truths banner at the top of each page will also take you there. On the Welcome page, in the Recent Library Additions panel, are listed the items most recently added to our Library departments, showing the date we published them.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../help/Basic_Navigation/Library_Listings/index.html">Library Listings</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Library Listings</h1>

<p>Check out one of the Library categories. For instance, to see our Books listings, click the Texts tab, and then the Books category. A title index is displayed, from which you can browse through our titles. By selecting one of the letters, a list is shown of our online books which start with that letter.</p>

<p>All of our item listings may be sorted by a number of criteria. Books may be sorted by title, author, year, subject, excerpt, or the date we published it online; the three magazines are sorted by issue, rather than title. Also note that if any item is missing the data you are sorting by, it will not be included in the results. For example, we do not know the year <a class="green" href="../../../texts/The_Instruction_of_Youth_in_the_Christian_Life/index.html" title="The Instruction of Youth in the Christian Life">The Instruction of Youth in the Christian Life</a> was written or first published, so it will not be listed when sorting items by year.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="../../Basic_Navigation/example_list_texts.gif" alt="" width="720" height="200" /></div>
<p>Continue to see an example of the listings in our Music department, which are somewhat different.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../help/Basic_Navigation/Music/index.html">Music</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Music</h1>

<p>In addition to lyrics, the majority of the music on the site have sheet music available, and we hope, in time, to include a voice recording of as many as possible.</p>

<p>All songs that have sheet music to go with them have the sheet music icon
<img style="vertical-align:middle;" src="../../../assets3/link_score.gif" alt="" width="22" height="22" /> which you can click to view the music.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="../../Basic_Navigation/example_list_music.gif" alt="" width="720" height="160" /></div>
<p>When you click the title of a song, you are taken to the main page of the song, which displays the song lyrics.</p>

<p>(Note that some of the song collections we have been republishing contain music that is still copyrighted. We have not obtained permission to copy these songs, so we can only list some basic information about them. See <a href="../../../help/Management_and_Policies/Copyrights">Copyrights</a> for more information.)</p>

<p>On the left panel is displayed a bunch of information about the song:</p>

<ul>
<li>title</li>

<li>author (followed by the year it was written or published, if known)</li>

<li>a link to copyright license or public domain notice</li>

<li>the main subject</li>

<li>a scripture reference or two associated with the song</li>

</ul>

<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../help/Basic_Navigation/Link_Formatting/index.html">Link Formatting</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Link Formatting</h1>

<p>I&#8217;ll wrap up this tutorial by explaining the color schemes of the links.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s rather simple, actually&#8212;at least, it&#8217;s <i>supposed</i> to be simple. As a rule of thumb, the <span class="green"><b>green-colored</b></span> class of links are for Library items, and the <span class="blue"><b>blue links</b></span> point to site resources, to match the colors of the page &#8220;trimmings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Any <span class="orange"><b>orange-colored</b></span> links you find on this site will take you <i>off</i> this site. (After visiting a link, it becomes darker&#8212;the <span class="orange"><b>orange</b></span> ones change to <span class="red"><b>maroon</b></span>.)</p>

<p>Did you notice the asterisk (<span class="scripture script_ref">*</span>) after the scripture quote on the welcome page? Check it out if you haven&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Did you note that the scripture quote is dark green? All scripture quotes on this site will be that color. That green-colored asterisk is a link: if you hover over it with your mouse, a text message will pop up, telling what the scripture reference is. Furthermore, if you click the link, it will take you to the passage on the <a class="green" href="../../../bible//index.html" title="">Bible</a> department of the Library, which is the King James Version. All scripture quotes are from the KJV unless otherwise indicated.</p>

<p>Those are the main types of links on this site, and with that, you have completed Basic Navigation. Now go and navigate to your heart&#8217;s content, and may God bless you as you explore His timeless truths!</p>

<p><i>&#8212;The Webmaster</i></p>
