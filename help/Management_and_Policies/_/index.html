<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>You may not have known it, but every move you make on our website is being watched.</p>

<p>Now that I&#8217;ve been blunt about it, let me try to put you more at ease. In the first case, the information that we gather does not include your credit card information or even your name. Like many sites, we get information on which pages you look at, the time you look at them, and your IP address. If you are uncomfortable with this happening, we suggest that you leave, or get software to browse the web anonymously.</p>

<p>The reason this information is gathered is to, hopefully, be able to make this site better, by seeing the general trends of what our users are doing.</p>



<div class="section_head"><table><tr><td class="section_head"><div class="left"><a href="../../../help/Management_and_Policies/Copyrights/index.html">Copyrights</a></div><div class="right"><p><a href="#logo">Return to top</a></p></div></td></trow></table></div>



<h1>Copyrights</h1>

<p>This site was built for the edification of all, and as such, we&#8217;d like this to be a resource shared with as many as possible. You are free to do nearly anything with the works on this site; however, there are some restrictions.</p>

<p>On the main page of each work, following the title and author, the copyright notice for that work is listed. The majority of the works will be listed as &#8220;Public Domain.&#8221; These works are in the public domain in the United States, and most likely in other countries as well. Users from other countries are responsible for checking the copyright status of a work in their respective country. We try to be very careful in verifying the public domain status of a work before labeling as such. The use without permission of any work that is still protected by copyright is purely an oversight and unintentional. Owners of such copyrights or heirs of the authors who have legal interests in any of these works are asked to contact us so that these issues be resolved. Note that we do not generate any revenue from this Library.</p>

<p>Note that the license given for a music tune applies to all the associated media files for that tune. For example, as the tune &#8220;Blacklands&#8221; (used for the song <a class="green" href="../../../music/He_Giveth_More_Grace/index.html" title="He Giveth More Grace">He Giveth More Grace</a>) is &#8220;Public Domain,&#8221; all the media files&#8212;sheet music, midi, mp3, wma&#8212;are public domain as well.</p>

<p>Some of the works, particularly a number of songs from <a class="green" href="../../../music/The_Blue_Book/_/title_index.html" title="The Blue Book">The Blue Book</a> collection, are still under copyright, as far as we know; these will display only the first line of lyrics, with copyright information following. These are listed in the Library mainly to help users who have <i>The Blue Book</i> songbook. To find these copyrighted songs, sort the collection list by number.</p>

<p>We have also included a few works of uncertain copyright status; we don&#8217;t have evidence that they are in the public domain, nor can we find any indication that they are still under copyright. If you have more information about these works, please <a class="www" href="http://library.timelesstruths.org/contact/?to=">let us know</a>.</p>

<p>All of our periodicals&#8212;<a class="green" href="../../../texts/Foundation_Truth/_/issue_index.html" title="Foundation Truth">Foundation Truth</a>, <a class="green" href="../../../texts/Treasures_of_the_Kingdom/_/issue_index.html" title="Treasures of the Kingdom">Treasures of the Kingdom</a>, and <a class="green" href="../../../texts/Dear_Princess/_/issue_index.html" title="Dear Princess">Dear Princess</a>&#8212;are licensed under a <a class="red" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</a>. Basically, we have given you permission to copy any or all of the contents of our periodicals, excepting those parts otherwise copyrighted by others. You may republish the material as long as you give credit to Timeless Truths Publications, and make clear our license terms. For example:</p>

<blockquote>

<h1>Publication Sources</h1>

<p>Our desire is to promote good literature. For this reason we do not focus on the particular history and source of the texts we republish. That is not to say that we do not place any value on the historical context of these works, but for a number of reasons we deem it best to focus on what was written instead. When known, we provide the author&#8217;s name and the year it was first written or published. For many of the works we have republished, we know little about its publication history. Also, though we often use a particular published work as a source, as publishers ourselves, we often edit these works to varying degrees, though we try to avoid changing the author&#8217;s intent. Sometimes we formally acknowledge this in a prefatory note; but mostly it goes without saying. So consider these as editions by Timeless Truths Publications.</p>
